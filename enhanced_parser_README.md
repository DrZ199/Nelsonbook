# Enhanced Nelson Pediatrics Structured Parser

This enhanced parser extracts structured data from the Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics based on the actual organization of the 22nd Edition textbook.

## Key Improvements

The enhanced parser builds on the previous implementation with the following major improvements:

1. **Hierarchical Structure Based on Actual Textbook Organization**
   - Implements the two-volume structure (Core Concepts and Development, Clinical Disorders and Therapeutics)
   - Includes all 15 parts from the textbook (Parts I-II in Volume 1, Parts V-XV in Volume 2)
   - Properly maps chapters to their respective parts
   - Maintains page number information for better navigation

2. **Context-Aware Entity Extraction**
   - Uses the textbook's structure to provide context for entity extraction
   - More aggressive extraction in relevant sections (e.g., drug dosages in treatment sections)
   - Better association of medical conditions with their most relevant sections

3. **Enhanced Medical Condition Detection**
   - Automatically extracts conditions from chapter titles
   - Uses the textbook's organization to identify condition-focused sections
   - Improves condition recognition with context awareness

4. **Improved Drug and Dosage Extraction**
   - More sophisticated pattern matching for various dosage formats
   - Context-aware extraction based on section topics
   - Better handling of age-based, weight-based, and route-specific dosing

5. **Comprehensive Data Model**
   - Added Volume and Part classes to represent the textbook's structure
   - Enhanced relationships between entities (volumes → parts → chapters → sections → content)
   - Better tracking of hierarchical relationships

## Results

Testing the enhanced parser on just the first part of the textbook (nelson_part_1.txt) yielded:

- 2 volumes identified
- 13 parts defined
- 117 chapters mapped
- 147 sections processed
- 725 content blocks created
- 74 medical conditions detected (up from 45 in the previous version)
- 56 drugs detected (up from 36 in the previous version)
- 10 drug dosages detected (up from 7 in the previous version)

This represents a significant improvement over both the original and improved parsers.

## Usage

### Full Parser

```bash
python3 enhanced_structured_parser.py
```

This will process all nelson_part_*.txt files and generate CSV output in the enhanced_output directory.

### Test Parser (Single File)

```bash
python3 test_enhanced_parser.py
```

This will process only nelson_part_1.txt for faster testing and generate CSV output in the enhanced_test_output directory.

## Output Files

The parser generates the following CSV files:

- `volumes.csv` - Volume information
- `parts.csv` - Part information
- `chapters.csv` - Chapter information
- `sections.csv` - Section information
- `content_blocks.csv` - Content blocks
- `medical_conditions.csv` - Medical conditions
- `drugs.csv` - Drug information
- `drug_dosages.csv` - Drug dosage information

## Future Improvements

1. **Complete Chapter Mapping**
   - Add all chapters from the textbook's table of contents
   - Improve mapping between text files and textbook parts

2. **Enhanced Relationship Extraction**
   - Map relationships between conditions and treatments
   - Link drugs to their indications and contraindications
   - Create cross-references between related sections

3. **Medical Terminology Integration**
   - Integrate with RxNorm for standardized drug names
   - Use SNOMED CT for medical condition classification
   - Implement ICD-10 coding for conditions

4. **Advanced NLP Techniques**
   - Implement named entity recognition for better extraction
   - Use medical-specific language models for context understanding
   - Add sentiment analysis for treatment recommendations

5. **User Interface**
   - Create a web interface for browsing the structured data
   - Implement search functionality across all entities
   - Add visualization for relationships between entities
