Chapter 632 u Deformational Plagiocephaly
TREATMENT
Prevention

The sleep position should be monitored and varied. Alternating the
infant’s head to face the head and foot of the crib on alternate nights
will allow the infant to sleep facing into the room without always lying
on the same side of the head. Consistently alternating the sleeping
position early on allows the infant to have equal time on both sides
of the occiput, and the infant will become used to this pattern. Infants
who have an obvious positional preference for a particular side will
take more time and make more effort to purposefully reposition themselves counter to their preference. Parents must be counseled in the
benefit of this strategy in preventing bald spots or flat spots that can
progress to cranial deformity.
Tummy time is the term used to describe the infant’s awake time
spent lying on the stomach. The suggested amount of tummy time is
10-­15 minutes at least 3 times a day. Reassure parents that sleep is the
only time during which the prone position should be avoided, and educate the parents as to the benefits for the infant of awake prone positioning to help progression of motor development.

Treatment Options

Cranial asymmetry from DP does not usually spontaneously improve,
nor do the more severe manifestations of facial and ear asymmetry disappear. Once a flat spot develops, it is unlikely that the infant will be
able to overcome the pull to lie on the same spot in time to allow for
reversal of the asymmetry.
Watch-­and-­wait management is not recommended in infants with
DP. Evidence suggests that, at a minimum, repositioning and physiotherapy (RPPT) should be initiated as soon as asymmetry is observed.
RPPT includes the counseling and teaching of parents about positional changes and tummy time for their child, as well as the referral
to physical therapy in the case of congenital torticollis. RPPT is the
optimal treatment choice for patients younger than 4 months of age
who have mild or moderately severe DP. The earliest types of behavioral modifications can be as simple as increasing tummy time or repositioning the infant’s crib such that everything interesting in the room
is on the side opposite the DP.
Molding therapy (helmet therapy) is the use of an orthotic helmet to
promote the resolution of cranial asymmetry while the infant’s head is
still rapidly growing. Orthotic helmets do not actively mold the skull;
rather, they protect the areas that are flat and allow the child to grow
into the flat spot. Helmet therapy achieves correction 3 times faster and
better than repositioning alone. This therapy is still debated because of
its expense, time requirements, coverage, and side effects (irritation,
rashes, and pressure sores). Combined treatment with helmet therapy
and RPPT is the most beneficial management of infants older than 4
months with severe DP or with worsening of mild or moderate DP trialed on RPPT. Infants with severe DP should be considered for helmet
therapy at any age.
Studies suggest helmet therapy should be started for significant DP
between 4 and 8 months and continued for 7-­8 months. Parents should
be counseled on the commitment involved in this treatment because
helmets need to be worn up to 23 hours per day. Noncompliance has
been documented in 80% of study patient populations in as little as 4
months.
Risk factors are associated with failure of RRPT and helmet therapy.
Table 632.5 provides a list of these risk factors by treatment modality.
These are important to consider when prescribing treatment regimens

to families in order to give the patient the best chance at a successful
outcome.
Patients with craniosynostosis require surgery. Sometimes, a molding helmet can be used as an adjunctive therapy after surgery but never
as monotherapy.

OUTCOMES

Outcomes may be better when helmet therapy is started before 6
months of age; infants starting therapy later than that do not achieve
the same degree of normal head measurements as those whose helmet
therapy is started before 6 months of age. Significant improvements
in asymmetry are usually obvious at 4-­11 weeks after starting helmet therapy. An 8-­year single-­center review analyzing 4,378 patients
found complete correction in 77.1% of patients undergoing conservative (RRPT) therapy and 94.4% of patients treated with helmet
therapy.
Studies in patients with a median follow-­up age of 9 years found that
75% of cases had what both parents and patients considered to be a
normal head appearance. Nine percent of patients and 4% of parents
noted residual asymmetry that they considered significant. Though
some literature hints at more satisfaction and less anxiety in parents
of helmeted children, there is evidence to suggest that the treatment
modality and outcome make no difference regarding parents’ long-­
term satisfaction.
There is a small but growing body of literature that suggests conservative therapy (RRPT) may be as effective as helmet therapy for correcting certain cases of DP. Generalization of these findings to larger
populations is not currently possible.
Cognitive and academic outcomes may be different depending
on the side of deformity. Poorer academic performance and greater
speech abnormalities were found in patients with left-­sided deformities than in those with right-­sided deformities. This manifested as
double the number of patients with expressive speech abnormalities
and triple the number of special education needs. It is unclear what
the underlying mechanism is; treatment differences were apparently
not a factor. In general, children with DP and without comorbid conditions are usually developmentally normal, healthy children. This
development contrasts with craniosynostosis, in which increases in
intracranial pressure may have deleterious effects on central nervous
system function.

Chapter 633

Seizures in Childhood
Mohamad A. Mikati, Dmitry Tchapyjnikov,
and Kevin M. Rathke
An epileptic seizure is a sudden transient occurrence of signs and/or
symptoms resulting from abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal
activity in the brain. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE)
operational classification of seizure types divides epileptic seizures
into four categories based on the presumed mode of seizure onset:
focal, generalized, unknown onset, and unclassified (Figs. 633.1 and
633.2). In focal (formerly known as partial) seizures, the first clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) changes suggest initial activation of a system of neurons limited to part of one cerebral hemisphere.
Focal seizures can be described as motor or nonmotor and are further
characterized by preserved or impaired consciousness, which is used
synonymously with the term awareness. Simple partial seizure is an
outdated term that refers to a focal seizure with no alteration in consciousness or awareness; the current term is focal aware seizure. Complex partial seizure is also an outdated term that denotes focal seizures
with altered consciousness or awareness of the surroundings; they are
currently referred to as focal seizures with impaired awareness. In
generalized seizures, the first clinical and EEG changes indicate synchronous involvement of both hemispheres. A seizure may be labeled
as being of unknown onset if there is not enough clinical information
available to determine if the seizure is focal or generalized. If the clinical characteristics of a seizure are unusual and a determination of onset
cannot be made despite an adequate evaluation, the seizure may be
labeled as unclassified. Approximately 30% of patients who have a first
afebrile seizure later develop epilepsy; the risk is approximately 20% if
the neurologic exam, EEG, and neuroimaging are normal.
Febrile seizures are a separate category (see Chapter 633.1). Acute
symptomatic or provoked seizures occur secondary to an acute problem affecting brain excitability, such as an electrolyte imbalance; most
children with these types of seizures do well. However, sometimes
these seizures signify major structural, inflammatory, or metabolic disorders of the brain, such as meningitis, encephalitis, acute stroke, or
brain tumor. Consequently, the prognosis depends on the underlying
disorder, including its reversibility or treatability and the likelihood of

developing epilepsy from it. An unprovoked seizure is one that is not
an acute symptomatic seizure. A remote symptomatic seizure is one
secondary to a distant brain injury, such as an old stroke.
Reflex seizures are a type of seizure precipitated by a sensory
stimulus. These types of seizures can be caused by a variety of stimuli,
including visual (flickering lights, patterns, reading), auditory (music),
somatosensory, or proprioceptive stimuli; praxis; eating; bathing in hot
water; or being startled (see Chapter 631.9).
Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate seizures and by the neurobiologic, cognitive,
psychologic, and social consequences of this condition (see Fig. 633.2).
The clinical diagnosis of epilepsy usually requires the occurrence of at
least one unprovoked epileptic seizure with either a second such seizure or enough EEG and clinical information to convincingly establish
an enduring predisposition to develop recurrences. For epidemiologic
and, commonly, for clinical purposes, epilepsy is considered present
when two or more unprovoked seizures occur in a time frame of longer than 24 hours in between them. Approximately 4–10% of children
experience at least one seizure (febrile or afebrile) in the first 16 years
of life. The cumulative lifetime incidence of epilepsy is 3%, and more
than half of the disorders start in childhood. The annual prevalence is
0.5–1.0%. Thus the occurrence of a single seizure or of febrile seizures
does not necessarily imply the diagnosis of epilepsy. Seizure disorder
is a general term that is usually used to include any one of several disorders, including epilepsy, febrile seizures, and, possibly, single seizures
and symptomatic seizures secondary to metabolic, infectious, or other
etiologies (e.g., hypocalcemia, meningitis).
An epileptic syndrome is a disorder that manifests as one or more
specific seizure types and has a specific age of onset and a specific prognosis. Several types of epileptic syndromes can be distinguished (Tables
633.1-­633.6; Fig. 633.3). This category must be distinguished from the
category of epileptic seizures that refers to single events rather than to
clinical syndromes. In general, the seizure type is the primary determinant of the medications to which the patient is likely to respond,
and the epilepsy syndrome determines the prognosis one could expect.
An epileptic encephalopathy is an epilepsy syndrome in which there
is a severe EEG abnormality that is thought to result in cognitive and
other impairments. Developmental encephalopathy denotes a disorder in which the underlying etiology (e.g., a specific gene variant)
contributes to a developmental delay independently of the patient’s
seizure burden and/or EEG abnormalities. The terms epileptic and
developmental encephalopathy can be combined (i.e., developmental
epileptic encephalopathy) in specific situations where both the EEG
abnormalities and the underlying etiology contribute to the patient’s
developmental delay.

The ILAE Task Force on Classification has proposed a multilevel
framework for categorizing epilepsies (Table 633.7). This framework
should help guide therapeutic decisions and assist with prognostication. At the most basic level (level 1), a patient’s epilepsy can be classified by seizure type (focal, generalized, focal and generalized, or
unknown). At the next level (level 2), based on available clinical data
and known seizure types, an epilepsy type can be assigned (focal, generalized, focal and generalized, or unknown). At the next level (level
3), if further clinical data are available and based on supporting studies
(e.g., EEG and/or MRI), the diagnosis of a specific epilepsy syndrome
can be made (e.g., juvenile myoclonic epilepsy). Concurrent to this
classification paradigm, the associated comorbidities and the underlying cause for the epilepsy must also be considered. If categorized by
etiology, epilepsies are grouped into genetic, structural, metabolic,
immune, infectious, or unknown categories. It is important to note that
these categories are not mutually exclusive, and a patient’s epilepsy may
have multiple concurrent etiologies (e.g., genetic and structural). At
the final level (level 4) of categorizing and diagnosing the epilepsy, the
epilepsy syndrome, the underlying etiology, and associated comorbidities are considered.
Genetic epilepsy (previously also referred to as idiopathic epilepsy) implies that the epilepsy syndrome is the direct result of a
known or presumed genetic defect(s) that is not causative of a brain
structural or metabolic disorder other than the epilepsy. This category encompasses genetic generalized epilepsies (previously called
idiopathic generalized epilepsies), such as childhood absence epilepsy, as well as epilepsies caused by a known gene defect (see Tables
633.1-­633.6).
Structural epilepsy (previously called symptomatic epilepsy) refers
to an epilepsy syndrome caused by an underlying structural brain disorder that may or may not be genetic. This includes etiologies such
as old stroke or hypoxic-­ischemic injury, as well as epilepsy secondary to tuberous sclerosis (which is also genetic). Immune-­mediated
epilepsy is an important category that describes epilepsies occurring
secondary to immune-­mediated central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. This group of disorders warrants special attention because
immunotherapies such as steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin
(IVIG) may be the first-­line treatments. Autoimmune encephalitides
such as anti–N-­methyl-­d-­aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis and
anti-­LG1 limbic encephalitis are examples of immune-­mediated epilepsies. Infectious epilepsy describes epilepsies secondary to chronic

infectious conditions such as tuberculosis and HIV rather than acute
infections such as bacterial meningitis or herpes simplex virus (HSV)
encephalitis.
The older terms cryptogenic epilepsy and presumed symptomatic
epilepsy refer to an epilepsy syndrome in which there is a presumed
underlying brain disorder causing the epilepsy and affecting neurologic function, but the underlying disorder is not known; the disorder
is now referred to as unknown epilepsy, designating that the underlying cause of the epilepsy is still unknown.

EVALUATION OF THE FIRST SEIZURE

The initial evaluation of an infant or a child during or shortly after a
suspected seizure should include an assessment of the adequacy of
the airway, ventilation, and cardiac function, as well as measurement
of temperature, blood pressure, and glucose concentration. For acute
evaluation of the first seizure, the physician should search for potentially life-­threatening causes of seizures, such as meningitis, systemic
sepsis, unintentional or intentional head trauma, and ingestion of
drugs or medications or other toxins. The history should aim to determine if the event was a seizure or not and to define factors that might
have promoted the convulsion and to provide a detailed description of
the seizure and the child’s postictal state.
The subsequent step in an evaluation is to determine whether
the seizure has a focal onset or is generalized. Focal seizures could
include forceful turning of the head and eyes to one side, unilateral
clonic movements beginning in the face or extremities, or a sensory
disturbance, such as paresthesia or pain localized to a specific area.
Focal seizures in an adolescent or adult usually indicate a localized
lesion, whereas these seizures during childhood are often either secondary to a lesion or the result of a genetic, formerly known as idiopathic, epilepsy. Focal seizures in a neonate may be seen because of
focal lesions such as perinatal stroke or because of a metabolic abnormality such as hypocalcemia that results in focal seizures that may
not generalize because of immaturity of the brain connections. Focal
and generalized motor seizures may be tonic-­clonic, tonic, clonic,
myoclonic, or atonic. Tonic seizures are characterized by increased
tone or rigidity (usually lasting 2 seconds up to several minutes), and
atonic seizures are characterized by flaccidity and lack of movement.
Clonic seizures consist of rhythmic, fast muscle contractions and
slightly longer relaxations; myoclonus is a shocklike contraction of
a muscle of <50 milliseconds that is often repeated. The duration of

Epilepsies
Level 1: Determine if the event was an epileptic seizure and, if so,
characterize the seizure type or types based on available clinical
information as focal, generalized, or unknown. (Refer to Fig. 633.1
for more detailed characterizations.)
Level 2: Determine the type of epilepsy the patient has (focal,

comorbidities.
The etiology for the epileptic seizures should be considered at all
levels of an epilepsy diagnosis as listed earlier; etiologic categories
include:

the seizure and state of consciousness (retained or impaired) should
be documented. The history should determine whether an aura
preceded the convulsion and the behavior the child was exhibiting
immediately preceding the seizure. Auras can take the form of a
number of sensations, including visual (e.g., flashing lights or seeing
colors or complex visual hallucinations), somatosensory (tingling),
olfactory, auditory, vestibular, or experiential (e.g., déjà vu, déjà vécu
feelings) sensations, depending on the precise localization of the origin of the seizures. The most common aura experienced by children
consists of epigastric discomfort or pain and a feeling of fear. The
posture of the patient, presence or absence and distribution of cyanosis, vocalizations, loss of sphincter control (more commonly of the
urinary bladder), and postictal state (including sleep, headache, and
hemiparesis) should be noted. The provider taking the history should

ask specifically about each of these symptoms as appropriate because
caretakers may not spontaneously report them. Determination of
focal versus generalized onset is sometimes difficult historically. A
seizure may start focally and secondarily generalize too quickly to
manifest observable early focal symptoms. In addition, a caregiver
witnessing the seizure later in its evolution may describe only the
more generalized-­appearing signs.
In addition to clarifying the seizure semiology, a detailed history is crucial in identifying an underlying cause for the seizure.
Reported personality changes or symptoms of increased intracranial pressure can suggest an intracranial tumor. Similarly, a history
of cognitive regression can suggest a degenerative or metabolic disease. A history of prenatal or perinatal distress or of developmental
delay can suggest etiologic congenital or perinatal brain dysfunction. Acute to subacute personality changes, psychiatric symptoms,
and/or associated movement abnormalities may suggest an autoimmune etiology.
The examination of a child with a seizure disorder should also be
geared toward the search for an organic cause. The child’s head circumference, length, and weight are plotted on a growth chart and compared with previous measurements. A careful general and neurologic
examination should be performed. A funduscopic exam should be
performed to evaluate for the presence of papilledema, optic neuritis, retinal hemorrhages, uveitis, chorioretinitis, coloboma, or macular changes, as well as retinal phakoma. The finding of unusual facial
features or of associated physical findings such as hepatosplenomegaly
may point to storage disease or inborn error of metabolism as the cause
of the neurologic disorder. The presence of a neurocutaneous disorder
may be indicated by the presence of vitiliginous ash leaf–type lesions
usually better seen using an ultraviolet light (Wood lamp); of adenoma
sebaceum, shagreen patches, or retinal phakomas (tuberous sclerosis);
of multiple café-­au-­lait spots (neurofibromatosis); or of V1-­or V2-­
distribution nevus flammeus (Sturge-­Weber syndrome) (see Chapter
636).
Localizing neurologic signs, such as a subtle hemiparesis with hyperreflexia, an equivocal or positive Babinski sign, and pronator drifting of
an extended arm with eyes closed, might suggest a contralateral hemispheric structural lesion, such as a slow-­growing glioma, as the cause
of the seizure disorder. Unilateral growth arrest of the thumbnail, hand,
or extremity in a child with a focal seizure disorder suggests a chronic
condition, such as a porencephalic cyst, arteriovenous malformation,
or cortical atrophy of the opposite hemisphere.

to pursue further laboratory testing, including serum electrolytes, a

Chapter 633 u Seizures in Childhood 3595
complete blood count, and/or urine toxicology tests, should be made
on a case-­by-­case basis that considers the patient’s clinical history and
examination. ECG to rule out long QT or other cardiac dysrhythmias
and other tests directed at disorders that could mimic seizures may
be needed (see Chapter 634). A lumbar puncture is usually of limited
value in an acute workup of a nonfebrile seizure unless the history or
examination is concerning for an infectious or inflammatory process
or if there is clinical concern for intracranial bleeding despite normal
brain imaging. A routine EEG should be performed in all cases of a first
unprovoked nonfebrile seizure to help predict the risk of seizure recurrence. If the patient’s neurologic status has returned to baseline, the EEG
can often be done on an outpatient basis even though the yield may be
slightly lower because the EEG has been delayed beyond the first 12
hours. Emergent brain imaging with a head CT or brain MRI is usually
performed if the seizure was focal, if there are postictal focal deficits on
neurologic exam, or if the patient’s status is not returning to baseline; in
patients with trauma preceding the seizure; and in patients with a high-­
risk medical history. In other situations, the yield of emergent imaging
identifying an abnormality that warrants emergent intervention is less
than 1%. Brain MRI is preferred over a CT scan, and performing it on a
nonemergent basis should be considered in most patients. CT is useful if
a rapid study is needed to look for trauma, a mass, or signs of increased
intracranial pressure. In select situations, such as when the clinical and
EEG manifestations are consistent with a genetic generalized epilepsy
such as childhood absence epilepsy, a brain MRI may not be necessary.
Gadolinium (contrast) does not need to be routinely used when performing the brain MRI unless there is clinical suspicion of a neoplasm,
vascular malformation, abscess, or another infectious or inflammatory process. Further details regarding the approach to a first seizure
are included in Chapter 633.2. The 2021 guidelines from the American College of Radiology provide recommendations in different clinical scenarios (variants) for pediatric patients presenting with seizures
while taking into consideration the patient’s age, precipitating events,
clinical findings, EEG, and neurodevelopmental status. These address
neonatal seizures, simple and complex febrile seizures, posttraumatic
seizures, focal seizures, and primary generalized seizures (Table 633.8).

633.1 Febrile Seizures
Mohamad A. Mikati, Dmitry Tchapyjnikov, and
Kevin M. Rathke
Febrile seizures are seizures that occur between the ages of 6 and 60
months of life (peak 12-­18 months old) with a temperature of 38°C
(100.4°F) or higher, that are not the result of CNS infection or any metabolic imbalance, and that occur in the absence of a history of prior afebrile seizures. A simple febrile seizure is a primary generalized, usually
tonic-­clonic, attack associated with fever, lasting for a maximum of 15
minutes, and not recurrent within a 24-­hour period. A complex febrile
seizure is more prolonged (>15 minutes), and/or is focal, and/or recurs
within 24 hours. Febrile status epilepticus is a febrile seizure lasting
longer than 30 minutes. Most patients with simple febrile seizures have
a very short postictal state and usually return to their baseline normal behavior and consciousness within minutes of the seizure. Febrile
infection–related (or refractory) epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) is a
very different disorder seen predominantly in older (>5 years of age)
usually male children and associated with an encephalitis-­like illness
but without an identifiable infectious agent. Children with FIRES were
previously normal but subsequently develop difficult-­to-­treat epilepsy.
Between 2% and 5% of neurologically healthy infants and children
experience at least one, usually simple, febrile seizure. Simple febrile
seizures do not have an increased risk of mortality even though they
are concerning to the parents. Complex febrile seizures may have an
approximately twofold long-­term increase in mortality rates as compared with the general population over the subsequent 2 years, probably secondary to a coexisting pathology. There are no long-­term
adverse effects of having one or more simple febrile seizures. Compared
with age-­matched controls, patients with febrile seizures do not have

Table 633. 8  American College of Radiology Panel
Summary of Recommendations for Imaging
After a Seizure
Variant 1: MRI head without IV contrast is usually appropriate for the
initial imaging of neonatal seizures.
Variant 2: Imaging is usually not appropriate for the assessment of
simple febrile seizures in children 6 months to 5 years of age.
Variant 3: MRI head without IV contrast may be appropriate for the
initial imaging of children 6 months to 5 years of age with complex
febrile seizures.
Variant 4: CT head without IV contrast or MRI head without IV
contrast is usually appropriate for the initial imaging of children
with posttraumatic seizures (not including abusive head trauma).
These procedures are equivalent alternatives (i.e., only one
procedure will be ordered to provide the clinical information to
effectively manage the patient’s care).
Variant 5: MRI head without IV contrast is usually appropriate for the
initial imaging of a child with focal seizures (not including abusive
head trauma). The panel did not agree on recommending MRI
head without and with IV contrast for this clinical scenario. There
is insufficient medical literature to conclude whether or not these
patients would benefit from this procedure in this clinical setting.
Imaging in this patient population is controversial but may be
appropriate.
Variant 6: MRI head without IV contrast may be appropriate for
the initial imaging of children with primary generalized seizure
(neurologically normal).
Variant 7: MRI head without IV contrast is usually appropriate for the
initial imaging of children with generalized seizure (neurologically
abnormal).
Variant 8: MRI head without IV contrast is usually appropriate for
children with intractable seizures or refractory epilepsy. The panel
did not agree on recommending MRI head without and with IV
contrast for children with intractable seizures or refractory epilepsy.
There is insufficient medical literature to conclude whether or not
these patients would benefit from administration of IV gadolinium
contrast in this clinical setting.

any increase in the incidence of abnormalities of behavior, scholastic
performance, neurocognitive function, or attention. Children who
develop later epilepsy, however, might experience such difficulties.
Febrile seizures recur in approximately 30% of those experiencing a
first episode, in 50% after two or more episodes, and in 50% of infants
younger than 1 year of age at febrile seizure onset. Several factors affect
the recurrence risk (Table 633.9). Although approximately 15% of children with epilepsy have had febrile seizures, only 5% (range 1–33%,
dependent on risk factors) of children who experience febrile seizures
proceed to develop epilepsy later in life. There are several predictors of
epilepsy after febrile seizures (Table 633.10).

GENETIC AND OTHER FACTORS LEADING TO
FEBRILE SEIZURES

The genetic contribution to the incidence of febrile seizures is manifested by a positive family history for febrile seizures in many patients.
In some families, the disorder is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, and multiple single genes that cause the disorder have
been identified in such families. However, in most cases the disorder
appears to be polygenic, and many genes predisposing to it remain to
be identified. Genes associated with febrile seizures include SCN1A,
SCN1B, SCN9A, and CPA6. In terms of other etiologies, a dysregulation between the proinflammatory interleukin (IL)-­1β, IL-­6, and IL-­8
cytokines and antiinflammatory ILR-­1A cytokines has been associated
with febrile status epilepticus. A decreased ILR-­1A/IL-­8 ratio (suggestive of an overall proinflammatory state) is predictive of hippocampal
abnormalities on MRI done after febrile status epilepticus. The ILR-­1A/
IL-­8 ratio may thus prove to be a potential biomarker for identifying
febrile seizure patients who may be at higher risk for developing mesial
temporal lobe epilepsy later in life.

Almost any type of epilepsy can be preceded by febrile seizures. A few
epilepsy syndromes typically start with febrile seizures; these are generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+), severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI or Dravet syndrome), and, in many
patients, temporal lobe epilepsy secondary to mesial temporal sclerosis. GEFS+ is an autosomal dominant syndrome with a highly variable
phenotype. Onset is usually in early childhood, and remission is usually in mid-­childhood. It is characterized by multiple febrile seizures
and by several subsequent types of afebrile generalized seizures, including generalized tonic-­clonic, absence, myoclonic, atonic, or myoclonic
astatic seizures with variable degrees of severity. A focal febrile seizure
plus epilepsy variant, in which the seizures are focal rather than generalized, has also been described.
Dravet syndrome is the most severe of the phenotypic spectrum
of febrile seizure–associated epilepsies. It constitutes a distinct entity,
the onset of which is in infancy. It is initially characterized by febrile
and afebrile unilateral clonic seizures that recur every 1 or 2 months.
These early seizures are typically induced by fever, but they differ from
the usual febrile convulsions in that they are more prolonged, more
frequent, and focal and recur in clusters. Seizures subsequently start
to occur with lower fevers and then without fever. During the second
year of life, myoclonus, atypical absences, and focal seizures occur
frequently, and developmental delay usually follows (Fig. 633.4). This
syndrome is usually caused by a de novo pathogenic variant, although
rarely it is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner or may be
inherited from a nonaffected carrier parent. Variants in the SCN1A
gene are the most common cause of Dravet syndrome (causing ∼80%
of all cases). The same gene is affected in the GEFS+ spectrum; however, in Dravet syndrome the variant leads to loss of function and

their precise incidence is unknown; including generalized tonic-­clonic

after the age of 7 yr, whereas sleep seizures increase after 6-­7 yr and
become predominant after age of 9-­10 yr. (From Gataullina S, Dulac O.

thus to a more severe phenotype. There are several milder variants of
Dravet syndrome that manifest some, but not all, of the previous features and that are referred to as Dravet syndrome spectrum or SMEI-­
Borderland. Rarely the GABRG2, SCN1B, and SCN2A genes may cause
Dravet syndrome; however, in 10–20% of the cases a specific gene variant is not identified.
The majority of patients who had prolonged febrile seizures and
encephalopathy after vaccination and who had been presumed to have
suffered from vaccine encephalopathy (seizures and psychomotor
regression occurring after vaccination and presumed to be caused by
it) turn out to have Dravet syndrome pathogenic gene variants, indicating that their disease is caused by the variant and not secondary to the
vaccine. This has raised doubts about the very existence of the entity
termed vaccine encephalopathy.

EVALUATION

Figure 633.5 delineates the general approach to the patient with febrile
seizures. Each child who presents with a febrile seizure requires a
detailed history and a thorough general and neurologic examination.
Febrile seizures often occur in the context of otitis media; roseola and
human herpesvirus (HHV) 6 infections; and infections with norovirus, parechovirus, enteroviruses, Shigella, or similar agents, making the
evaluation more demanding. In patients with febrile status epilepticus,
HHV-­6B (more frequently) and HHV-­7 infections may account for
30% of the cases.

Lumbar Puncture

Meningitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis, and
lumbar puncture should be performed for all infants younger than 6
months of age who present with fever and seizure, if the child is ill-­
appearing, or at any age if there are clinical signs or symptoms of concern. A lumbar puncture is an option in a child 6-­12 months of age
who is deficient in Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus
pneumoniae immunizations or for whom the immunization status is
unknown. A lumbar puncture is an option in children who have been
pretreated with antibiotics. In uninfected patients presenting with
febrile status epilepticus, a nontraumatic lumbar puncture rarely shows
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis (96% have <3 nucleated cells in

the CSF) with a concurrently normal CSF protein and glucose. Pleocytosis suggests bacterial or viral infection.

Electroencephalogram

If the child is presenting with the first simple febrile seizure and is otherwise neurologically healthy, an EEG need not be performed as part
of the evaluation. An EEG would not predict the future recurrence of
febrile seizures or epilepsy even if the result is abnormal. Spikes during
drowsiness are often seen in children with febrile seizures, particularly
those older than age 4 years, and these do not predict later epilepsy.
EEGs performed within 2 weeks of a febrile seizure often have nonspecific slowing, usually posteriorly. Thus in many cases, if an EEG is
indicated, it is delayed until or repeated after more than 2 weeks have
passed. An EEG should therefore generally be restricted to special cases
in which epilepsy is highly suspected (see Table 633.10), and, generally,
it should be used to delineate the type of epilepsy rather than to predict
its occurrence. If an EEG is done, it should be performed for at least 20
minutes in wakefulness and in sleep according to international guidelines to avoid misinterpretation and drawing of erroneous conclusions.
At times, if the patient does not recover immediately from a seizure, an
EEG can help distinguish between ongoing seizure activity and a prolonged postictal state. After febrile status epilepticus, focal EEG slowing over the temporal lobe increases the chance that the patient may
have medial temporal sclerosis on follow-­up.

Blood Studies

Blood studies (serum electrolytes, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium,
and a complete blood count) are not routinely recommended in the
workup of a child with a first simple febrile seizure. Blood glucose
should be measured initially and with prolonged postictal obtundation
or with poor oral intake (prolonged fasting). Serum electrolyte values
may be abnormal in children after a febrile seizure, but this should be
suggested by precipitating or predisposing conditions elicited in the
history and reflected in the physical examination. If clinically indicated
(e.g., dehydration), these tests should be performed. A low sodium
level is associated with a higher risk of recurrence of the febrile seizure
within the following 24 hours.

Neuroimaging

A CT or MRI is not recommended in evaluating the child after a first
simple febrile seizure. The workup of children with complex febrile
seizures needs to be individualized. This can include an EEG and
neuroimaging, particularly if the child is neurologically abnormal.
Approximately 10% of children with febrile status epilepticus are
reported to have unilateral or, less frequently, bilateral swelling of their
hippocampus acutely; subsequent long-­term hippocampal atrophy is
evident in about 71% of those who had the acute findings. Whether
these patients will ultimately develop temporal lobe epilepsy remains
to be determined.

TREATMENT

In general, antiepileptic therapy, continuous or intermittent, is not
recommended for children with one or more simple febrile seizures.
Parents should be counseled about the relative risks of recurrence of
febrile seizures and recurrence of epilepsy, educated on how to handle
a seizure acutely, and given emotional support. If the seizure lasts for
longer than 5 minutes, acute treatment with lorazepam, midazolam,
or diazepam is needed (see Chapter 633.8 for acute management of
seizures and status epilepticus). Rectal diazepam is often prescribed to
families to be used at home as a rescue medication if a febrile seizure
lasts longer than 5 minutes (see Table 633.14 for dosing). Alternatively,
buccal or intranasal midazolam or diazepam may be used. In cases
of frequently recurring febrile seizures, intermittent oral clonazepam
(0.01 mg/kg every 8-­12 hours up to a maximum dose of 1.5 mg/day) or
oral diazepam (0.33 mg/kg every 8 hours) can be given during febrile
illnesses. Such therapies help reduce, but do not eliminate, the risks of
recurrence of febrile seizures. Historically, continuous therapy with the
antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) phenobarbital or valproic acid was occasionally used to prevent febrile seizures. However, in the vast majority

of cases, use of continuous therapy is not justified because of the risk
of side effects and lack of demonstrated long-­term benefits, even if the
recurrence rate of febrile seizures is expected to be decreased by these
drugs.
Antipyretics can decrease the discomfort of the child but do not
reduce the risk of having a recurrent febrile seizure. Chronic antiepileptic therapy may be considered for children with a high risk for later epilepsy. The possibility of future epilepsy does not change with or without
antiepileptic therapy. Iron deficiency is associated with an increased
risk of febrile seizures, and thus screening for that problem and treating
it appear appropriate. A recent Delphi-­type European study generated
specific recommendations for providers to deliver to caretakers after
a febrile seizure (reference provided later). These included the definition of febrile seizures, basis of this clinical diagnosis, acknowledging
parental stress, risk of recurrence, and long-­term care of the child,
which also should include that the parents should avoid cosleeping,
which is dangerous for their child and does not prevent febrile seizures.

633.2 Unprovoked Seizures

Kevin M. Rathke

HISTORY AND EXAMINATION

Evaluation of a first-­time seizure was discussed earlier in this chapter. It
entails stabilization of the patient if the child presents during or shortly
after the seizure. A careful history and examination are done to accurately characterize the seizure, exclude acute intervenable causes, and
attempt to determine the underlying etiology of the seizure.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

This involves consideration of nonepileptic paroxysmal events (see
Chapter 634), determination of the seizure type as classified by the
ILAE system (see Fig. 633.1), and consideration of potential underlying
etiologies. Some seizures might begin with auras, which are sensory
experiences reported by the patient and are not observed externally.

3598 Part XXV u The Nervous System
Motor seizures can be tonic, clonic, myoclonic, atonic, or astatic.
Astatic seizures often follow myoclonic seizures and cause a momentary loss of tone with a sudden fall. Atonic seizures, on the other hand,
are usually longer, and the loss of tone often develops more slowly.
Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish among tonic, myoclonic, atonic,
or astatic seizures based on the history alone when the family reports
only that the patient falls; in such cases, the seizure may be described
as a drop attack. Loss of tone or myoclonus in only the neck muscles
results in a milder seizure referred to as a head drop. Tonic, clonic,
tonic-­clonic, myoclonic, and atonic seizures can be focal (including
one limb or one side only), focal with secondary generalization, or primary generalized. Epileptic spasms, or axial spasms (these terms being
preferred over infantile spasms because the spasms can occur beyond
infancy), consist of flexion or extension of the truncal and extremity
musculature that is sustained for 1-­2 seconds, shorter than the duration seen in tonic seizures, which last longer than 2 seconds. Focal
motor clonic and/or myoclonic seizures that persist for days, months,
or even longer are termed epilepsia partialis continua.
Absence seizures are generalized seizures consisting of staring,
unresponsiveness, and eye flutter lasting usually for a few seconds.
Typical absences are associated with 3-­
Hz spike–and–slow-­
wave
discharges and with childhood absence epilepsy, which has a good
prognosis. Atypical absences are associated with 1-­to 2-­Hz spike–
and–slow-­wave discharges and with head atonia and myoclonus during the seizures. They occur in Lennox-­Gastaut syndrome and similar
syndromes, which have a poor prognosis. Juvenile absences are similar to typical absences but are associated with 4-­to 5-­Hz spike–and–
slow-­wave discharges and often occur in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.
Seizure type and other EEG and clinical manifestations determine the
type of epilepsy syndrome with which a particular patient is afflicted
(see Tables 633.1-­633.6; see also Chapters 633.3 and 633.4).
A family history of certain forms of epilepsy, such as benign familial neonatal seizures, can suggest the specific epilepsy syndrome. More
often, however, different members of a family with a positive history of
epilepsy have different types of epilepsy. Specific findings on physical
exam may point to an underlying disorder causing the seizure, such
as tuberous sclerosis, Sturge-­Weber syndrome, neurofibromatosis, or
other brain malformations.

LONG-­TERM APPROACH TO THE PATIENT AND
ADDITIONAL TESTING

The approach to the patient with epilepsy is based on the diagnostic
scheme proposed by the ILAE Task Force on Classification and Terminology and presented in Table 633.7. Most epilepsy syndromes are
potentially caused by any one of multiple underlying or still undetermined etiologies. However, in addition, there are many epilepsy syndromes that are associated with specific gene mutations (see Tables
633.1-­633.6 and Fig. 633.3). Different pathogenic variants of the same
gene can result in different epilepsy syndromes, whereas variants of
different genes can cause the same epilepsy syndrome phenotype. The
clinical use of gene testing in the diagnosis and management of childhood epilepsy is indicated in patients manifesting specific underlying
malformational, metabolic, or degenerative disorders; patients with
severe epilepsy syndromes (such as West and Dravet syndromes and
progressive myoclonic epilepsies); and patients with syndromes of
mendelian inheritance (see Tables 633.1 and 633.6). Gene testing is
indicated in epilepsy encephalopathy syndromes and in patients with
other organ involvement (hepatic, muscle, cardiac, intestinal) and in
atypical phenotypes.
In patients with drug-­resistant epilepsy or in infants with new-­onset
epilepsy in whom the initial testing did not reveal an underlying etiology, a full metabolic workup, including amino acids, organic acids,
biotinidase, and CSF studies, is needed. Additional testing can include,
depending on the case, some or most of the following:
1.	Measurement of serum lactate, pyruvate, acyl carnitine profile, creatine,
very long-­chain fatty acids, ammonia, and guanidino-­acetic acid.
2.	Blood and serum sometimes need to be tested for white blood cell
lysosomal enzymes, serum coenzyme Q levels, and serum copper
and ceruloplasmin levels (for Menkes syndrome).

3.	Serum immune isoelectric focusing (or gene panels) is performed
for carbohydrate-­deficient transferrin in disorders of glycosylation.
CSF glucose testing looks for glucose transporter deficiency, and the
CSF can be examined for cells and proteins (for parainfectious and
postinfectious syndromes and for Aicardi-­Goutières syndrome, which
also shows cerebral calcifications and has a specific gene defect test
available).
4.	Other laboratory studies include CSF immunoglobulin (Ig) G index, NMDA receptor, and other autoimmune encephalitis–associated antibodies, as well as measles titers in serum and CSF.
5.	CSF tests can also confirm, with the appropriate clinical setup, the
diagnosis of cerebral folate deficiency, pyridoxine dependency,
pyridoxal-­
5-­
phosphate dependency, mitochondrial disorders,
nonketotic hyperglycinemia, neopterin/biopterin metabolism disorders, adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency, and neurotransmitter
deficiencies.
In infants who do not respond immediately to antiepileptic therapy,
vitamin B6 (100 mg intravenously) is given as a therapeutic trial to help
diagnose pyridoxine-­responsive seizures, with precautions to guard
against possible apnea. The trial is best done with continuous EEG
monitoring, including a preadministration baseline recording period.
Before the vitamin B6 trial, a pipecolic acid level and serum, urine, or
CSF α-­aminoadipic acid semialdehyde levels should be drawn because
they are often elevated in this rare syndrome and the therapeutic trial
result may not be definitive. Some patients are pyridoxal phosphate,
rather than pyridoxine, dependent. Patients with cerebral folate deficiency can also have intractable seizures. Thus trials of pyridoxal phosphate given orally (up to 50 mg/kg/day given every 6 hours) and folinic
acid (2.5-­5 mg twice a day, if needed; can titrate up to a maximum
dose of 8 mg/kg/day) over several weeks can help diagnose these rare
disorders while one is waiting for the definitive diagnosis from CSF or
genetic testing. Certain EEG changes such as continuous spike–and–
slow-­wave seizure activity and burst-­suppression patterns may also
suggest these vitamin-­responsive syndromes.
6.	Urine may also need to be tested for urinary sulfites indicating molybdenum cofactor deficiency and for oligosaccharides and mucopolysaccharides. MR spectroscopy can be performed for lactate
and creatine peaks to rule out mitochondrial disease and creatine
transporter deficiency.
7.	Gene testing looks for specific disorders that can manifest with
seizures, including SCN1A pathogenic variants in Dravet syndrome; ARX gene for West syndrome in males; MECP2, CDKL5,
and protocadherin 19 for Rett syndrome and similar presentations;
syntaxin-­binding protein for Ohtahara syndrome; and polymerase
G for West syndrome and other seizures in infants. Gene testing can
also be performed for other dysmorphic or metabolic syndromes.
8.	Muscle biopsy can be performed for mitochondrial DNA and oxidative enzymes as well as coenzyme Q10 levels, and skin biopsy for
inclusion bodies seen in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis and Lafora
body disease.
9.	Genetic panels are available that include multiple genes that can
cause epilepsy at specific ages; whole exome or genome sequencing
is also available. The availability of gene panels, particularly ones
that can test for amenably treatable conditions such as vitamin B6–
dependent epilepsy, and the rapid turnaround time have replaced
the need for many of the tests listed in points 1-­9.
10.	MRI should also be performed to identify congenital disorders
(cortical dysplasias, lissencephaly, schizencephaly), calcifications,
focal lesions (basal ganglia), and myelinization disorders (acute
disseminated encephalomyelitis [ADEM], leukodystrophies). MRI
may identify specific disorders such as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), stroke (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes [MELAS]), Rasmussen encephalitis, tumors, cerebral edema, hemorrhage, or venous
thrombosis (see Table 633.8). It should also be noted that seizures
alone may cause nonspecific-­nondiagnostic transient MRI abnormalities; these may include transient gray matter and subcortical
white matter signals or transient hippocampal and temporal lobe
abnormalities.

Chapter 633 u Seizures in Childhood 3599
Most patients do not require an extensive evaluation. The pace and
extent of the workup must depend on the clinical epileptic and nonepileptic features, the family and antecedent personal history of the
patient, the medication responsiveness of the seizures, the likelihood
of identifying a treatable condition, and the wishes and need of the
family to assign a specific diagnosis to the child’s illness.

633.3 Focal Seizures and Related Epilepsy
Syndromes
Mohamad A. Mikati and Dmitry Tchapyjnikov
Focal seizures account for approximately 40% of seizures in children
and can be divided into focal seizures with preserved awareness, in
which consciousness is not impaired, and focal seizures with impaired
awareness, in which consciousness is affected.
Focal seizures with preserved or impaired awareness can each occur
in isolation, one can temporally lead to the other (usually from preserved to impaired awareness), and/or each can progress into secondary generalized seizures, called focal to bilateral tonic-­clonic seizures,
although less commonly, the secondary generalized seizure may also
be tonic, clonic, or atonic.

FOCAL SEIZURES WITH PRESERVED AWARENESS

These can take the form of sensory seizures (auras, called focal aware
seizures) or brief motor seizures, the specific nature of which gives
clues as to the location of the seizure focus. Brief motor seizures are the
most common and include focal tonic, clonic, or atonic seizures. Often
there is a motor (Jacksonian) march from face to arm to leg, adversive
head and eye movements to the contralateral side, or postictal (Todd)
paralysis that can last minutes or hours, and sometimes longer. Unlike
tics, motor seizures are not under partial voluntary control; seizures are
more often stereotyped and are less likely than tics to manifest different
types in a given patient.

FOCAL SEIZURES WITH IMPAIRED AWARENESS

These seizures usually last 1-­2 minutes and are often preceded by an aura,
such as a rising abdominal feeling, déjà vu or déjà vécu, a sense of fear,
complex visual hallucinations, micropsia or macropsia (temporal lobe),
generalized difficult-­
to-­
characterize sensations (frontal lobe), focal
sensations (parietal lobe), or simple visual experiences (occipital lobe).
Children younger than 7 years old are less likely than older children to
report auras, but parents might observe unusual preictal behaviors that
suggest the experiencing of auras. Subsequent manifestations consist of
decreased responsiveness, staring, looking around seemingly purposelessly, and automatisms. Automatisms are automatic semipurposeful
movements of the mouth (oral, alimentary such as chewing) or of the
extremities (manual, such as manipulating the sheets; leg automatisms
such as shuffling, walking, or bicycling movements). Often there is salivation, dilation of the pupils, and flushing or color change. The patient
might appear to react to some of the stimulation around him or her but
does not later recall the epileptic event. At times, walking and/or marked
limb flailing and agitation occur, particularly in patients with frontal
lobe seizures. Frontal lobe seizures often occur at night and can be very
numerous and brief, but other complex partial seizures from other areas
in the brain can also occur at night. There is often contralateral dystonic
posturing of the arm and, in some cases, unilateral or bilateral tonic arm
stiffening. Some seizures have these manifestations with minimal or no
automatisms. Others consist of altered consciousness with contralateral
motor, usually clonic, manifestations. After the seizure, the patient can
have postictal automatisms, sleepiness, and/or other transient focal deficits such as weakness (Todd paralysis) or aphasia.

FOCAL TO BILATERAL TONIC-­CLONIC SEIZURES

These can either start with generalized clinical phenomena (from rapid
spread of the discharge from the initial focus) or as focal seizures with

subsequent clinical generalization. There is often adversive eye and
head deviation to the side contralateral to the side of the seizure focus,
followed by generalized tonic, clonic, or tonic-­clonic activity. Tongue
biting, urinary and stool incontinence, vomiting with risk of aspiration,
and cyanosis are common. Fractures of the vertebrae or humerus are
rare complications. Most such seizures last 1-­2 minutes. Focal tonic
or focal to bilateral tonic-­clonic seizures often manifest as adversive
head deviation to the contralateral side, fencing, hemi-­or full figure-­
of-­four arm, and/or Statue of Liberty postures. These postures usually
suggest a frontal origin and, when awareness is preserved during them,
favor that the seizure originated from the medial frontal supplementary motor area.
EEG in patients with focal/partial seizures usually shows focal spikes
or sharp waves in the lobe where the seizure originates. A sleep-­deprived
EEG with recording during sleep increases the diagnostic yield and is
advisable in all patients (Fig. 633.6). Despite that, approximately 15%
of children with epilepsy initially have normal EEGs because the discharges are relatively infrequent or the focus is deep. If repeating the
test does not detect paroxysmal findings, longer recordings in the laboratory or using ambulatory EEG or even inpatient 24-­hour video EEG
monitoring may be helpful. The latter is particularly helpful if the seizures are frequent enough because it then can allow visualization of the
clinical events and the corresponding EEG tracing.
Brain imaging is critical in patients with focal seizures. MRI is preferable to CT, which misses subtle but, occasionally, potentially clinically significant lesions. MRI can show pathologies such as changes as
a result of previous strokes or hypoxic injury, malformations, medial
temporal sclerosis, arteriovenous malformations, inflammatory pathologies, or tumors (Fig. 633.7). Of note is that patients with focal seizures
and epilepsies can have focal corresponding neuropsychologic deficits
but also have patterns of network-­related deficits such as impaired
social cognition, deficits that are shared with generalized epilepsies.

lobe epilepsy has been linked to acetylcholine-­receptor and to KCNT1
pathogenic variants. It manifests with nocturnal seizures with dystonic
posturing, agitation, screaming, and kicking that respond promptly to
carbamazepine. Several other less frequent familial benign epilepsy
syndromes with different localizations have also been described, some
of which occur exclusively or predominantly in adults.

These observations support current thinking that not only generalized
but also focal epilepsy involves network-­related pathophysiology.

BENIGN EPILEPSY SYNDROMES WITH FOCAL
SEIZURES

The most common such syndrome is benign childhood epilepsy
with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS), which typically starts during
childhood (ages 3-­10 years) and is outgrown by adolescence. The child
typically wakes up at night because of a focal seizure with preserved
awareness causing buccal and throat tingling and tonic or clonic contractions of one side of the face, with drooling and inability to speak
but with preserved consciousness and comprehension. Focal seizures
with impaired awareness and secondary generalized seizures can also
occur. EEG shows typical wide-­based centrotemporal spikes that are
markedly increased in frequency during drowsiness and sleep. MRI is
normal. Patients respond very well to AEDs such as oxcarbazepine and
carbamazepine. In some patients who only have rare and mild seizures,
treatment might not be needed. Traditionally patients with BECTS
are considered to have normal neurocognitive development, but some
studies have documented problems in memory and in other neuropsychologic functions and in attention. Atypical BECTS is a less common
variant of the disorder characterized by often a younger age of onset,
multiple seizure types including drop attacks, atypical EEG patterns
including secondary bilateral synchrony, and/or other comorbidities
such as developmental delay.
Benign epilepsy with occipital spikes can occur in early childhood (Panayiotopoulos type) and manifests with focal seizures with
impaired awareness and with ictal vomiting; they may also first appear
in later childhood (Gastaut type) as focal seizures with impaired
awareness, visual auras, and migraine headaches that occur independently or postictally (epilepsy-­migraine sequence). Both are typically
outgrown in a few years.
In infants, several less common benign infantile familial convulsion syndromes have been reported. For some of these, the corresponding gene variant and its function are known (see Table 633.1),
including benign familial neonatal seizures (KCNQ2, KCNQ3),
benign familial neonatal infantile seizures (SCN2A), and early
familial neonatal infantile seizures (SCN2A).
A number of benign infantile nonfamilial syndromes have been
reported, including focal seizures with impaired awareness with temporal foci, focal to bilateral tonic-­clonic seizures with variable foci,
tonic seizures with midline foci, and focal seizures in association with
mild gastroenteritis. All of these have a good prognosis and respond to
treatment promptly; often, only short-­term therapy (e.g., 6 months),
if any therapy, is needed. Nocturnal autosomal dominant frontal

Symptomatic structural/metabolic epilepsy secondary to focal brain
lesions has a higher chance of being severe and refractory to therapy
than genetic (idiopathic) epilepsy. Many patients with focal lesions,
for example, old strokes or brain tumors, either never have seizures or
have well-­controlled epilepsy. In infants, drug-­resistant epilepsy with
focal seizures is often caused by severe metabolic problems, hypoxic-­
ischemic injury, or congenital malformations. In addition, in this age-­
group, a syndrome of multifocal severe partial seizures with progressive
mental regression and cerebral atrophy called epilepsy of infancy with
migrating focal seizures (EIMFS; previously called malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy) has been described. Some cases of EIMFS
are secondary to pathogenic variants in the calcium-­sensitive potassium
channel KCNT1. Brain malformations causing focal epilepsy include
focal cortical dysplasia, hemimegalencephaly, Sturge-­Weber cutaneous
lesion, tuberous sclerosis, and congenital tumors such as ganglioglioma
and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors and others. The intractable seizures can be focal seizures with or without impaired awareness, focal to bilateral tonic-­clonic seizures, or combinations thereof.
If secondary generalized seizures predominate and take the form of
absence-­like seizures and drop attacks, the clinical picture can mimic
the generalized epilepsy syndrome of Lennox-­Gastaut syndrome and
has been termed by some as pseudo–Lennox-­Gastaut syndrome.
Temporal lobe epilepsy can be caused by any temporal lobe lesion.
A common cause is mesial (also termed medial) temporal sclerosis,
a condition often preceded by febrile seizures. They are rarely genetic
in origin. Pathologically, these patients have atrophy, gliosis, or cortical dysplasia of the hippocampus and, in some these conditions, of the
amygdala. Some patients with mesial temporal sclerosis have pathogenic variants in SUCO. Medial temporal lobe epilepsy is the most
common cause of surgically remediable partial epilepsy in adolescents
and adults. Occasionally, in patients with other structural or genetic
focal or generalized epilepsies, the focal discharges are so continuous
that they cause an epileptic encephalopathy. Activation of temporal
discharges in sleep can lead to loss of speech and verbal auditory agnosia (Landau-­Kleffner epileptic aphasia syndrome). Activation of secondary generalized and at times focal discharges in sleep leads to more
global delay secondary to the syndrome of continuous spike waves in
slow-­wave sleep (>85% of the slow-­wave sleep recording is dominated
by discharges).
The syndrome of Rasmussen encephalitis is a form of chronic
encephalitis that manifests with unilateral intractable partial seizures,
epilepsia partialis continua, and progressive hemiparesis of the affected
side, with progressive atrophy of the involved hemisphere. The etiology is usually unknown, although autoimmune etiologies have been
hypothesized.

ABSENCE SEIZURES

Typical absence seizures usually start at 5-­8 years of age and are often,
because of their brevity, overlooked by parents for many months even
though they can occur up to hundreds of times per day. Unlike focal
seizures with impaired awareness, they do not have an aura, usually last

Chapter 633 u Seizures in Childhood 3601
for only a few seconds, and are sometimes accompanied by eyelid flutter or upward rolling of the eyes but typically not by the usually more
florid automatisms seen in focal seizures with impaired awareness
(absence seizures can have simple automatisms such as lip smacking
or picking at clothing, and the head can very minimally fall forward).
Absence seizures do not have a postictal period and are characterized
by immediate resumption of what the patient was doing before the seizure. Hyperventilation for 3-­5 minutes can precipitate the seizures and
the accompanying 3-­Hz spike–and–slow-­wave discharges. The presence of eye closure eyelid myoclonia (Jeavons syndrome) and periorbital, perioral, or limb myoclonic jerks (the latter called myoclonic
absences) with the typical absence seizures usually predicts difficulty
in controlling the seizures with medications. Early-­onset absence seizures (<4 years of age) or drug resistance should trigger evaluation for
a glucose transporter defect, which is often associated with low CSF
glucose levels and an abnormal sequencing test of the SLC2A1 transporter gene.
Atypical absence seizures have associated myoclonic components
and tone changes of the head (head drop) and body, usually last longer than typical absence seizures, and are also usually more difficult to
treat. They are precipitated by drowsiness and are usually accompanied
by 1-­to 2-­Hz spike–and–slow-­wave discharges.
Juvenile absence seizures are similar to typical absences but occur
at a later age and are accompanied by 4-­to 6-­Hz spike–and–slow-­wave
and polyspike–and–slow-­wave discharges. These are usually associated
with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (see “Benign Generalized Epilepsies”).

GENERALIZED MOTOR SEIZURES

The most common generalized motor seizures are generalized tonic-­
clonic seizures that can be either primarily generalized (bilateral) or
focal to bilateral tonic-­clonic (as described in Chapter 633.3) from
a unilateral focus. If there is no partial component, the seizure usually starts with loss of consciousness and, at times, with a sudden cry,
upward rolling of the eyes, and a generalized tonic contraction with
falling, apnea, and cyanosis. In some, a clonic or myoclonic component
precedes the tonic stiffening. The tonic phase is followed by a clonic
phase that, as the seizure progresses, shows slowing of the rhythmic
contractions until the seizure stops, usually 1-­2 minutes later. Incontinence and a postictal period often follow. The latter usually lasts for
a few minutes up to several hours with semicoma or obtundation and
postictal sleepiness, weakness, ataxia, hyperreflexia or hyporeflexia, and
headaches. There is a risk of aspiration and injury. First aid measures
include positioning the patient on his or her side, clearing the mouth
if it is open, loosening tight clothes or jewelry, and gently extending
the head and, if necessary, insertion of an airway by a trained professional. The mouth should not be forced open with a foreign object (this
could dislodge teeth, causing aspiration) or with a finger in the mouth
(this could result in serious injury to the examiner’s finger). Many
patients have single genetic generalized tonic-­clonic seizures that
may be associated with a concurrent illness or with a cause that cannot be ascertained (see Chapter 633.2). Generalized tonic, atonic, and
astatic seizures often occur in severe generalized pediatric epilepsies.
Generalized myoclonic seizures can occur in either benign or difficult-­
to-­control generalized epilepsies (see “Benign Generalized Epilepsies”
and “Severe Generalized Epilepsies”).

BENIGN GENERALIZED EPILEPSIES

Childhood absence epilepsy typically starts in mid-­childhood, and
most patients outgrow it before adulthood. Approximately 25% of
patients also develop generalized tonic-­clonic seizures, half before and
half after the onset of absences. Benign myoclonic epilepsy of infancy
consists of the onset of myoclonic and other seizures during the first
year of life, with generalized 3-­Hz spike–and–slow-­wave discharges.
Often, it is initially difficult to distinguish this type from more severe
syndromes, but follow-­up clarifies the diagnosis. GEFS+ manifests as
febrile seizures and multiple types of generalized seizures in multiple
family members, and at times different individuals within the same
family manifest different generalized and febrile seizure types (see
Chapter 633.1).

Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (Janz syndrome) is the most common
generalized epilepsy in young adults, accounting for 5% of all epilepsies. It has been linked to pathogenic variants in many genes, including CACNB4; CLNC2; EJM2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9; GABRA1; GABRD; and
myoclonin1/EFHC1. Typically, it starts in early adolescence with one
or more of the following manifestations: myoclonic jerks in the morning, often causing the patient to drop things; generalized tonic-­clonic
or clonic-­tonic-­clonic seizures upon awakening; and juvenile absences.
Sleep deprivation, alcohol (in older patients), and photic stimulation or, rarely, certain cognitive activities can act as precipitants. The
EEG usually shows generalized 4-­to 5-­Hz polyspike–and–slow-­wave
discharges.
There are other forms of generalized epilepsies such as photoparoxysmal epilepsy, in which generalized tonic-­clonic, absence, or myoclonic generalized seizures are precipitated by photic stimuli such as
strobe lights, flipping through TV channels, and viewing video games.
Other forms of reflex (i.e., stimulus-­provoked) epilepsy can occur;
associated seizures are usually generalized, although some may be focal
(see Chapter 633.9).

SEVERE GENERALIZED EPILEPSIES

Severe generalized epilepsies are associated with intractable seizures
and developmental delay. Early myoclonic encephalopathy (EME)
starts during the first 2 months of life with severe myoclonic seizures
and a burst suppression pattern on EEG. It is usually caused by inborn
errors of metabolism such as nonketotic hyperglycinemia. Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (Ohtahara syndrome) has a similar
age of onset and EEG but manifests as tonic seizures and is usually
caused by brain malformations or various epileptogenic gene mutations. The term early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE) has also
been applied to the increasing number (∼36) of other genetic epileptic encephalopathies and developmental epileptic encephalopathies
that are associated with an increasing number of specific genes with
pathogenic variants (Table 633.11); these may or may not manifest as
Ohtahara syndrome, but all share the characteristic of early-­onset epileptic encephalopathy. For example, EIEE type 4 is Ohtahara syndrome
caused by syntaxin-­
binding protein 1 pathogenic variants. Severe
myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (Dravet syndrome), most often caused
by pathogenic variants in SCN1A, starts as focal febrile status epilepticus or focal febrile seizures and later manifests as myoclonic and other
seizure types (see Chapter 633.1).
West syndrome starts between the ages of 2 and 12 months and
consists of a triad of infantile epileptic spasms that usually occur in
clusters (particularly in drowsiness or upon arousal), developmental
regression, and a typical EEG picture called hypsarrhythmia (see Fig.
633.6). Hypsarrhythmia is a high-­voltage, slow, chaotic background
with multifocal spikes. Patients with cryptogenic/idiopathic (referred
to as unknown etiology) West syndrome have normal development
before onset, whereas patients with symptomatic West syndrome have
preceding developmental delay owing to perinatal encephalopathies,
malformations, underlying metabolic disorders, infections like with
congenital Zika virus, or other etiologies (see Chapter 633.2). In males,
West syndrome can also be caused by ARX gene variants (often associated with ambiguous genitalia and cortical migration abnormalities).
West syndrome, especially in cases where the etiology is unknown
(i.e., cases that are not explained by the presence of a gene variant or
a structural brain anomaly), is a medical emergency because a delay
in diagnosis of 3 weeks or longer can affect the long-­term prognosis.
The spasms are often overlooked by parents and by physicians, being
mistaken for startles caused by colic or other benign paroxysmal syndromes (see Chapter 634).
Lennox-­Gastaut syndrome typically starts between the ages of 2
and 10 years and consists of a triad of developmental delay, multiple
seizure types that as a rule include atypical absences, and myoclonic,
astatic, and tonic seizures, as well as specific EEG abnormalities. The
tonic and/or atonic seizures occur either in wakefulness (causing falls
and injuries, broadly termed drop attacks) or also, typically, in sleep.
The third component is the EEG findings (see Fig. 633.6): 1-­to 2-­Hz
spike and slow waves, polyspike bursts in sleep (also called generalized

paroxysmal fast activity or GPFA), and a slow background in wakefulness. Most patients are left with long-­term cognitive impairment
and intractable seizures despite multiple therapies. Some patients start
with Ohtahara syndrome, develop West syndrome, and then progress
to Lennox-­
Gastaut syndrome. Myoclonic astatic epilepsy (Doose

syndrome) is a syndrome similar to, but milder than, Lennox-­Gastaut
syndrome and is characterized by seizures consisting of myoclonic
jerking rapidly followed by an atonic (astatic) drop attack. Patients with
Doose syndrome usually do not have tonic seizures or polyspike bursts
in sleep. The prognosis is more favorable than that for Lennox-­Gastaut
syndrome. Another syndrome characterized by atonic seizures causing
head nodding as well as tonic, clonic, and stimulus-­sensitive seizures
is nodding syndrome, which is seen in some African countries and
is often associated with encephalopathy, stunted growth, and variable
degrees of cognitive deficits. The underlying etiology is a likely autoimmune reaction to the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus. The head
nodding is associated with generalized slow waves and electrodecrement, likely representing generalized ictal activity, but is commonly
resistant to drug therapy.
Progressive myoclonic epilepsies (EPM) are a group of epilepsies
characterized by progressive dementia and worsening myoclonic and
other seizures. Type I, or Unverricht-­Lundborg disease, is caused by
pathogenic variants in the CSTB gene, is more slowly progressive than
the other types, and usually starts in adolescence. Type II, or Lafora
body disease, can have an early childhood onset but usually starts in
adolescence, is more quickly progressive, and is usually fatal within the
second or third decade of life. It can be associated with photosensitivity,
manifests periodic acid–Schiff–positive Lafora inclusions on muscle or
skin biopsy (in eccrine sweat gland cells), and has been shown to be
caused by laforin (EPM2A) or malin (EPM2B) gene variants and possibly PRDM8 in 90% of patients. Other causes of progressive myoclonic
epilepsy include myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF,
caused by various pathogenic variants in mitochondrial DNA), sialidosis type I (caused by variants in NEU1), neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (lysosomal storage disorders caused by variants in CLN1-­CLN14),
type 3 neuronopathic Gaucher disease (caused by lysosomal glucocerebrosidase deficiency), dentatorubral-­pallidoluysian atrophy
(caused by unstable expansion of trinucleotide repeats on the ATN1
gene), action myoclonus–renal failure syndrome (aka EPM4, caused
by variants in SCARB2), progressive myoclonus epilepsy–ataxia syndrome (aka EPM5, caused by variants in PRICKLE1), and North Sea
progressive myoclonic epilepsy (aka EPM6, caused by variants in
GOSR2).
Myoclonic encephalopathy in nonprogressive disorders is an
epileptic encephalopathy that occurs in some congenital disorders
affecting the brain, such as Angelman syndrome, and consists of
almost continuous and difficult-­to-­treat myoclonic and, at times, other
seizures.
Landau-­Kleffner syndrome is a rare condition of presumed autoimmune but sometimes also of genetic (GRIN2A variants) etiology. It is
characterized by loss of language skills and by verbal auditory agnosia
in a previously normal child; ∼70% have associated clinical seizures.
The seizures, when they occur, are of several types, including focal with
preserved awareness, focal to bilateral tonic-­clonic, atypical absence,
focal with impaired awareness, and occasionally myoclonic seizures.
High-­amplitude spike-­and-­wave discharges predominate and tend to
be bitemporal. In the later evolutionary stages of the condition, the EEG
findings may be normal. The spike discharges are always more apparent during non–rapid eye movement sleep; a child in whom Landau-­
Kleffner syndrome is suspected should have an EEG during sleep. CT
and MRI studies typically yield normal results. In the related but clinically distinct epilepsy syndrome called epileptic encephalopathy with
continuous spike waves in slow-­wave sleep (CSWS), the discharges
occur in >85% of the slow-­wave sleep, a finding termed electrical
status epilepticus in sleep (ESES). ESES can also occur in Landau-­
Kleffner syndrome, but in CSWS the discharges are usually frontal or
generalized and the delays usually global. The approach to and therapy
for the two syndromes are similar. Although valproic acid and benzodiazepines are often used first, the evidence favors that they address
the seizures and that steroids and possibly nocturnal diazepam are the
more effective agents for the aphasia. Some children respond to the
combination of valproic acid and clobazam or to levetiracetam. Nocturnal diazepam (0.2-­0.5 mg/kg orally at bedtime for several months)
is often used as first-­or second-­line therapy, as are steroids used either

Chapter 633 u Seizures in Childhood 3603
orally (more commonly studied) or intravenously. Oral prednisone is
started at 2 mg/kg/day for 1-­2 months, then weaned over a period of
1-­3 months. Alternatively, monthly infusions of high-­dose intravenous
methylprednisolone have been used instead of oral steroids. Long-­term
therapy is often needed irrespective of which drug(s) elicit a patient
response. If the seizures and aphasia persist after diazepam and steroid trials, then a course of IVIGs should be considered because many
patients can respond to that. It is imperative to initiate speech therapy
and maintain it for several years, because improvement in language
function occurs over a prolonged period.
Amenably treatable metabolic epilepsies are well recognized (see
Table 633.6). Pyridoxine-­dependent epilepsy typically presents with
a neonatal or infantile (and rarely childhood) onset of encephalopathy
with, at times, reports of increased fetal movements (seizures) in utero.
There are recurrent focal motor seizures, generalized tonic seizures,
and myoclonus. Seizures progress to status epilepticus if no pyridoxine is used. Diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of elevated plasma,
urine, and CSF α-­aminoadipic semialdehyde and elevated plasma and
CSF pipecolic acid levels. The presence of either homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in ALDH7A1 (which encode
the protein antiquitin) confirms the diagnosis. The use of pyridoxine
100 mg daily orally (higher doses, up to 500-­600 mg/day, have been
used) or intravenously helps stop the seizures. Variants of PROSC can
also cause pyridoxine-­
dependent epilepsy. Pyridoxal phosphate–
responsive neonatal epileptic encephalopathy (pyridox[am]ine
5′-­phosphate oxidase [PNPO] deficiency) may present similarly in the
absence of gastrointestinal symptoms sometimes seen with pyridoxine-­
dependent epilepsy. Diagnostically, there are reduced pyridoxal phosphate levels in the CSF with increased levels of CSF levodopa and
3-­methoxytyrosine, along with decreased CSF homovanillic acid and
5-­hydroxyindoleacetic acid. The EEG may show a burst suppression
pattern. Treatment is by enteral administration of pyridoxal phosphate
(up to 50 mg/kg/day every 6 hours). Folinic acid–responsive seizures
may also present with neonatal or infantile epileptic encephalopathy
and intractable seizures. Some of these patients have a diagnostic profile similar to that of pyridoxine-­dependent epilepsy patients, and their
disorder is caused by the same gene variants but responds to folinic
acid supplementation in addition to pyridoxine. Cerebral folate deficiency, which also responds to high doses of folinic acid (1-­3 mg/kg/
day), may manifest with epilepsy, intellectual disability, developmental
regression, dyskinesias, and autism. CSF 5-­methyltetrahydrofolate levels are decreased, with normal plasma and red blood cell folate levels.
There are usually pathogenic variants in the folate receptor (FOLR1)
gene or blocking autoantibodies against membrane-­associated folate
receptors of the choroid plexus. Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiencies
with or without hyperphenylalaninemia may present with epilepsies
and symptoms resulting from deficiencies of dopamine (parkinsonism, dystonia), noradrenaline (axial hypotonia), serotonin (depression,
insomnia, temperature changes), and folate (myelin formation, basal
ganglia calcifications, and seizures). Treatment is by substitution therapy with tetrahydrobiopterin and neurotransmitter precursors started
as early as possible. Creatine deficiency syndromes present typically
with developmental delay, seizures, autistic features, and movement
disorders and are diagnosed by gene sequencing and abnormal levels of
urine creatine and guanidinoacetic acid and/or, particularly in the case
of creatine transporter deficiency, an absent creatine peak on MR spectroscopy of the brain. Use of creatine monohydrate and dietary restrictions is helpful. Biotinidase deficiency presenting as developmental
delay, seizures, ataxia, alopecia, and skin rash and often associated with
intermittent metabolic acidosis and an organic acid profile of lactic and
propionic acidemia, responds to the use of biotin. Serine biosynthesis
defects with low serine levels in plasma or CSF amino acids often present
with congenital microcephaly, intractable seizures, and psychomotor
retardation and respond to supplemental serine and glycine. Developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes are caused by activating
pathogenic variants in the adenosine triphosphate–sensitive potassium channels. Sulfonylurea drugs that block the potassium channel
treat the neonatal diabetes and probably also favorably affect the CNS
symptoms and affect seizures. Hyperinsulinism-­hyperammonemia

syndrome is caused by activating variants of the glutamate dehydrogenase encoded by GLUD1. Patients present with hypoglycemic seizures
after a protein-­rich meal with hyperammonemia (ammonia levels 80-­
150 μmol/L). They are managed with a combination of protein restriction, AEDs, and diazoxide (a potassium channel agonist that inhibits
insulin release). GLUT-­1 deficiency syndrome (caused by pathogenic
variants in SLC2A1, which encodes for a glucose transporter) classically
presents with infantile-­onset epilepsy, developmental delay, acquired
microcephaly, and complex movement disorders. It causes impaired
glucose transport to the brain that is typically diagnosed by genetic
testing or a finding of low CSF lactate and CSF glucose or low CSF–
to–serum glucose ratios (<0.4). The manifestations of the disease are
usually responsive to the ketogenic diet. Thiamine transporter variants with acute basal ganglia disease often presents with accompanying seizures and is responsive to biotin and thiamine supplementation.
Riboflavin transporter deficiency can also manifest as a seizure in
addition to the usual symptoms of neuromuscular (polyneuropathy)
weakness; it is treated with high-­dose riboflavin supplementation.

633.5 Mechanisms of Seizures
Mohamad A. Mikati, Muhammad S. Zafar, and
Dmitry Tchapyjnikov
There are four distinct, often sequential, mechanistic processes in the
pathophysiology of epilepsy. First is the underlying etiology, which is
any pathology or pathologic process that can disrupt neuronal function and connectivity, leading to the second process (epileptogenesis),
which makes the brain epileptic. Sometimes the underlying etiology
can directly increase excitability even without the contribution of the
downstream effects of epileptogenesis.
In some genetic epilepsies, a disorder in ion channel function and/
or structure is the underlying etiology that leads to aberrant signal
transduction, which can cause seizures (see Tables 633.2-­633.4). These
variants can involve voltage-­gated channels (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl−, and
HCN [hydrogen cyanide]), ligand-­gated channels (nicotinic acetylcholine and γ-­aminobutyric acid A receptors [GABAA]), or other proteins.
For example, in Dravet syndrome, the loss-­of-­function pathogenic
variant in SCN1A encodes a voltage-­gated sodium channel and causes
decreased excitability in inhibitory GABAergic interneurons, leading
to increased excitability and epilepsy. In human cortical dysplasia, the
expression of the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor is increased,
leading to excessive depolarizing currents. Gene variants can also
affect neurotransmitter function through other mechanisms (see Table
633.3). For example, ARX variants can lead to dysfunction in GABAergic neurons and can cause X-­linked West syndrome, among other epilepsies. In fragile X syndrome, it is hypothesized that variants in FMR
cause enhanced glutamatergic signaling via the mGluR5 receptor. In
Rett syndrome, variants in MECP2 lead to increased NMDA receptor
expression, which can cause epilepsy and other symptoms associated
with the disorder.
In infantile spasms, animal models suggest that increases in the
stress-­related corticotropin-­releasing hormone, sodium channel blockade, and NMDA receptor stimulation are contributing mechanisms.
Autoimmune etiologies for epilepsy are also recognized. Autoantibodies, sometimes generated because of cross-­reactivity from a recent
infection or secondary to a malignancy, can bind to extracellular receptors or other proteins expressed in neurons. This, in turn, leads to an
inflammatory response and, in some cases, seizures. NMDA-­receptor
antibody encephalitis is probably the best-­characterized autoimmune
cause of epilepsy. Other epilepsy syndromes have been associated with
autoantibodies targeting the voltage-­gated potassium channel complex
(anti-­LGI2 and anti-­CASPR2), GABA receptors (GABA-­A and GABA­B), glycine receptors, and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD).
Abnormalities in the structure of the brain can be the underlying
etiology for epilepsy. The structural abnormalities can be scarring from

3604 Part XXV u The Nervous System
previous injuries (hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy [HIE], stroke,
cerebral hemorrhage), brain tumors, vascular malformations (cavernomas or arteriovenous malformations), and Sturge-­Weber syndrome.
In some cases where no identifying underlying etiology is found, epilepsy may be from the self-­resolving maturational process of developing brains like BECTS and childhood occipital epilepsy syndromes
(Gastaut and Panayiotopoulos types).
Second, epileptogenesis is the mechanism through which the brain,
or part of it, turns epileptic. The role of large-­scale molecular cell signaling pathways in epileptogenesis has been implicated in the mechanisms leading to epilepsy, namely, the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR), the Ras/ERK, and repressor element 1 (RE1)–silencing
transcription factor (REST) pathways. The mTOR pathway is seen in
tuberous sclerosis, hemimegalencephaly, and cortical dysplasia–related
epilepsies; the Ras/ERK pathway in a number of syndromes; and the
REST pathway in epileptogenesis after acute neuronal injury. Repeat
seizures lead through the earlier and other mechanisms to rewiring of
the brain and to long-­term epilepsy.
The third process is the resultant epileptic state of increased excitability present in all patients irrespective of the underlying etiology or
mechanism of epileptogenesis. A dysregulation of glutamatergic excitation versus GABAergic inhibition occurs in epileptogenic neurons,
which creates a seizure focus or network.
The fourth process is seizure-­related neuronal injury, as often is
demonstrated by MRI in patients after prolonged status epilepticus
or those with long-­term drug-­resistant epilepsy. Many patients show
acute swelling in the hippocampus or other regions after status epilepticus and long-­term hippocampal atrophy with sclerosis on MRI.
There is evidence from surgically resected epileptic tissue that apoptotic pathways are activated in foci of drug-­resistant epilepsy. There is
evidence that the pathophysiology of epileptic seizures, whether focal
or generalized, and of the coexisting comorbidities involves disruption
of neural networks of the brain resulting not only in increased excitability but the often-­associated abnormal neurologic dysfunction.

633.6 Treatment of Seizures and Epilepsy
Mohamad A. Mikati, Muhammad S. Zafar, and
Dmitry Tchapyjnikov

DECIDING ON LONG-­TERM THERAPY

After a first seizure, if the risk of recurrence is low, such as when the
patient has a normal neurodevelopmental status, EEG, and MRI (risk
∼20%), treatment is usually not started. If the patient has an abnormal
EEG, MRI, developmental status, and/or neurologic exam and/or has
a positive family history of epilepsy, the risk is higher, and often treatment is started. Other considerations are also important, such as motor
vehicle driving status and type of employment in older patients or the
parents’ ability to manage recurrences or AED therapy in children. The
decision is individualized and should be discussed with the family.
Figure 633.8 presents an overview of the approach to the treatment of
seizures and epilepsy.

COUNSELING

An important part of the management of a patient with epilepsy is educating the family and the child about the disease, its management, and
the limitations it might impose and how to live with them. Restrictions
on driving (in adolescents), swimming, and certain sports are usually
necessary (Table 633.12). In most states, the physician is not required
to report the epileptic patient to the motor vehicle registry; this is the
patient’s responsibility. The physician is then requested to complete
a specific form for patients who are being cleared to drive. In addition, in most states, a seizure-­free period of 6 months, and in some
states longer, is required before driving is allowed. Often swimming
in rivers, lakes, or the sea and underwater diving are prohibited, but

swimming in pools may be allowable. When swimming, even patients
with epilepsy under excellent control should be under the continuous
supervision of an observer who is aware of the condition and capable
of lifeguard-­level rescue.
The physician, parents, and child should jointly evaluate the risk of
involvement in athletic activities. To participate in athletics, proper
medical management, good seizure control, and proper supervision
are crucial to avoid significant risks. The ILAE Task Force on Sports
and Epilepsy recommendations group sports into categories based on
the potential risk of injury or death to the patient and to bystanders.
Group 1 sports are associated with no significant additional risk to
patients with epilepsy and include most athletics (excluding pole vaulting), bowling, most collective contact sports such as judo and wrestling,
most ground-­based collective sports (e.g., baseball, basketball, cricket,
field hockey, football, rugby), cross country skiing, curling, dancing,
golf, and racquet sports, including tennis and table tennis. Group 2
sports are associated with moderate risk to patients with epilepsy but
not to bystanders; they include alpine skiing, archery, pole vaulting,
biathlon/triathlon/modern pentathlon, canoeing, collective sports that
can potentially lead to serious injury (e.g., boxing, karate, kickboxing),
cycling, fencing, gymnastics, horse riding, ice hockey, shooting, skateboarding, roller and ice skating, skiing and snowboarding, swimming,
water skiing, and weightlifting. Group 3 sports are considered high
risk for the patient and for bystanders; they include aviation, climbing,
platform and springboard diving, horse racing, motorsports, parachuting and other forms of skydiving, rodeo, scuba diving, ski jumping,
solitary sailing, and surfing and windsurfing (see Table 633.12). In general, there has been a shift toward encouraging safe sports participation
in patients with epilepsy rather than indiscriminately restricting their
participation; however, the decision has to be individualized to the
patient and his or her family. Staying physically active has been shown
to reduce the chance for neuropsychologic impairments that often are
associated with epilepsy.
Counseling is helpful to support the family and to educate them
about the resources available in the community. Educational and, in
some cases, a psychologic evaluation may be necessary to evaluate
for possible learning disabilities or abnormal behavioral patterns that
might coexist with epilepsy. Epilepsy does carry a risk of increased
mortality rates (2 or more times the standardized mortality rates of the
general population) and of sudden unexpected death. This is mostly
related to the conditions associated with or underlying epilepsy (e.g.,
tumor, metabolic diseases), to poor seizure control (e.g., in patients
with severe epileptic encephalopathies or drug-­resistant seizures), and
to poor compliance with prescribed therapies. Thus it is recommended
that family members be informed about this increased risk without
inappropriately increasing their anxiety. Many family members feel
they need to observe the patient continuously in wakefulness and sleep
and have the patient sleep in the parents’ room to detect seizures. There
are advertised seizure-­detection devices that use motion sensors placed
under the mattress or worn on the wrist to detect seizures. Some are
disappointing and ineffective in detecting seizures, whereas data from
other equipment are encouraging. They are useful in detecting a majority of generalized tonic-­clonic seizures during sleep; most have not been
rigorously studied. Whether such measures can reduce the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) remains to be seen. The
parents need to guard against being overprotective to avoid adversely
affecting the child’s psychology. Education about what to do in case of
seizures, the choices of treatment or no treatment and medications and
their side effects, and the potential complications of epilepsy should
be provided to the parents and, if the child is old enough, to the child.

PRINCIPLE OF DRUG THERAPY

The clinical pharmacology of an AED consists of three important facets: pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacogenomics.
Pharmacokinetics describes how the body affects antiepileptics
after administration through the mechanisms of absorption and distribution, as well as the metabolic changes of the substance in the body.
The steps involved in pharmacokinetics are liberation (the process of
release of a drug from the pharmaceutical formulation), absorption

(the process of a substance entering the blood circulation), distribution
(the dispersion or dissemination of substances throughout the fluids
and tissues of the body), metabolism (the irreversible transformation
of parent compounds into daughter metabolites), and excretion (the
removal of the substances from the body).
Pharmacodynamics describes the biochemical and physiologic
effect of AED dose or concentration. The response may be desirable
(effectiveness) or untoward (toxicity). Pharmacogenomics is the study
of how variant forms of human genes contribute to interindividual
variability in drug response.

MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF ANTIEPILEPTIC
DRUGS

AEDs reduce excitability by interfering with sodium, potassium, or calcium ion channels by reducing excitatory neurotransmitter release or
function or enhancing GABAergic inhibition (Fig. 633.9). Most medications have multiple mechanisms of action, and the exact mechanism
responsible for their activity in human epilepsy is usually not fully
understood. Often, medications acting on sodium channels are effective against partial seizures, and medications acting on T-­type calcium
channels are effective against absence seizures. Voltage-­gated sodium
channels are blocked by felbamate, valproate, topiramate, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin, rufinamide, lacosamide,
and zonisamide. T-­type calcium channels found in the thalamus area

are blocked by valproate, zonisamide, and ethosuximide. Voltage-­gated
calcium channels are inhibited by gabapentin, pregabalin, lamotrigine,
and felbamate. N-­type calcium channels are inhibited by levetiracetam.
GABAA receptors are activated by phenobarbital, benzodiazepines,
topiramate, felbamate, and levetiracetam. Tiagabine, by virtue of its
binding to GABA transporters 1 (GAT-­1) and 3 (GAT-­3), is a GABA
reuptake inhibitor. GABA levels are increased by vigabatrin via its irreversible inhibition of GABA transaminases. Valproate inhibits GABA
transaminases, acts on GABAB presynaptic receptors (also done by
gabapentin), and activates glutamic acid decarboxylase (the enzyme
that forms GABA).
Glutaminergic transmission is decreased by felbamate that blocks
NMDA and AMPA (α-­amino-­3-­hydroxy-­5-­methyl-­4-­isoxazole-­
propionic acid)/kainate receptors. Topiramate also blocks AMPA/kainate receptors. Levetiracetam and brivaracetam bind to the presynaptic
vesicle protein SV2A found in all neurotransmitter vesicles and possibly result in inhibition of presynaptic neurotransmitter release in a use-­
dependent manner. Perampanel blocks glutamate AMPA receptors.
The precise mechanisms by which cannabidiol (CBD) exerts its
anticonvulsant effect in humans are unknown. CBD does not appear
to exert its anticonvulsant effects through interaction with cannabinoid receptors. Fenfluramine increases extracellular levels of serotonin through interaction with serotonin transporter proteins and
exhibits agonist activity at serotonin 5HT-­2 receptors. Everolimus is

GABA, and inhibition of glutamate. Approved AEDs have effects on inhibitory (left-­hand side) and excitatory (right-­hand side) nerve terminals. The
antiepileptic efficacy in trials of most of these drugs as initial add-­ons does not differ greatly, indicating that seemingly similar antiseizure activity
can be obtained by mechanisms aimed at diverse targets. However, putative mechanisms of action were determined only after discovering the
antiseizure effects; mechanism-­driven drug discovery has played only a minor role. AMPA, α-­Amino-­3-­hydroxy-­5-­methyl-­4-­isoxazole propionic acid;

an inhibitor of mTOR, a serine-­threonine kinase, downstream of the
PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated (too active)
in tuberous sclerosis. Ganaxolone is a positive allosteric modulator of
synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. It is being studied for
long-­term use in certain types of epilepsy and in acute treatment of
status epilepticus.
There is also a role for immune modulation in treating epilepsy, as
depicted by the use of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), IVIG,
oral prednisone, and intravenous methylprednisolone.

CHOICE OF DRUG ACCORDING TO SEIZURE TYPE
AND EPILEPSY SYNDROME

Drug therapy should be based on the type of seizure and the epilepsy
syndrome and on other individual factors. In general, the drugs of first
choice for focal seizures and epilepsies are oxcarbazepine and levetiracetam; for absence seizures, ethosuximide; for juvenile myoclonic
epilepsy, valproate (less so in women because of its hormonal and fetal
side effects); other choices include levetiracetam (which is often the
first drug to use in other primary generalized seizures), lamotrigine,
zonisamide, topiramate, and perampanel. There is significant controversy about these choices, and therapy should always be individualized
(see “Choice of Drug: Other Considerations”).
West syndrome is best treated with hormonal therapy in the form
of either ACTH injections or, possibly, oral steroids. There are several
protocols that range in dose from high to intermediate to low. The recommended regimen of ACTH (80 mg/mL) is a daily dose of 150 units/
m2 (divided into twice-­daily intramuscular injections of 75 units/m2)
administered over a 2-­week period with a subsequent gradual taper
over a 2-­week period (30 units/m2 in the morning for 3 days; 15 units/
m2 in the morning for 3 days; 10 units/m2 in the morning for 3 days;
and 10 units/m2 every other morning for 6 days; then stop). Response
is usually observed within the first 7 days. During the tapering period
of any regimen, spasm relapse can occur. Remediation entails increasing the dose to the previously effective dose for 2 weeks and then beginning the taper again. Synthetic ACTH (tetracosactide/cosyntropin) can
also be used as long as the long-­acting (depot) preparation is chosen.
Oral high-­dose prednisolone is a lower-­cost alternative to ACTH and
does not necessitate families learning how to administer intramuscular
injections; however, it may be inferior in efficacy to ACTH, particularly
in those with cryptogenic (of unknown etiology) West syndrome.
Awake and asleep EEGs are often done 1, 2, and 4 weeks after the
initiation of hormonal therapy to monitor the patient’s response, with
the aim of clearing the EEG from hypsarrhythmia and of stopping the
seizures. Side effects, more common with the higher doses, include
hypertension, electrolyte imbalance, infections, hyperglycemia and/
or glycosuria, and gastric ulcers. Prophylactic therapy for ulcers with
an H2 blocker or protein pump inhibitor is desirable while the patient
is receiving hormonal therapy. Also, live vaccines are contraindicated,
and other vaccines are not effective during ACTH and steroid therapy
because of the immune-­suppressive effects of these hormonal agents.
Thus all vaccines are not given during hormonal therapy and in the
period after it (usually ≤3 months after the last dose).
Vigabatrin can be used as a first-­line agent to treat infantile spasms
in patients with tuberous sclerosis and is the second-­line choice if hormonal therapy was unsuccessful in other cases of infantile spasms.
Its principal side effect is retinal toxicity, seen in approximately 30%
of patients, most often if the drug is used for longer than 6 months,
with resultant visual field defects that persist despite the withdrawal of
the drug. Because of this toxicity, vigabatrin is available only through
a restricted distribution Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy
(REMS) program. The level of evidence for its efficacy is weaker than
that for ACTH but stronger than that of other alternative medications.
Emerging evidence suggests that dual treatment with vigabatrin and
hormonal therapy at the onset of spasms may be superior to hormonal
therapy alone but may predispose to the CNS neurotoxicity of vigabatrin associated with increased T2 signal in the basal ganglia. The ketogenic diet is probably the third-­line therapy. Subsequent alternative
treatment options for spasms include valproate, benzodiazepines such
as nitrazepam and clonazepam, topiramate, lamotrigine, zonisamide,

pyridoxine, and IVIG. None of these alternative drugs offers uniformly
satisfactory results. However, they are useful for decreasing the frequency and severity of seizures in patients with symptomatic infantile
spasms and as adjunctive therapy in patients with idiopathic infantile
spasms who do not respond completely to ACTH or vigabatrin.
Lennox-­Gastaut syndrome is another difficult-­
to-­
treat epilepsy
syndrome. Treatment of seizures in the syndrome varies according
to the preponderant seizure type. For drop attacks (tonic, atonic, or
myoclonic-­astatic seizures), clobazam, valproate, lamotrigine, topiramate, felbamate, and rufinamide are considered effective. The FDA
also approved CBD and fenfluramine to be used in Lennox-­Gastaut
syndrome. Fenfluramine is available only through a restricted distribution REMS program because of the risk of valvular heart disease and
pulmonary arterial hypertension.
Felbamate is used as a last-­resort medication because of its potential toxicity. These drugs might control other types of seizures (partial,
generalized tonic-­clonic, atypical absence, other tonic, myoclonic).
For patients who have a preponderance of atypical absence seizures,
valproate, lamotrigine, or ethosuximide are often suitable drugs to
try because they are relatively less toxic than many alternative drugs.
Clonazepam is often helpful but produces significant sedation, hyperactivity, and drooling and often tolerance to its antiepileptic effects
develops in a few months. Consequently, in Lennox-­Gastaut or other
drug-­resistant epilepsy syndromes, clonazepam is often used as a rescue medication for clusters of seizures (disintegrating tablet preparation) or as a bridge over a few days until dose changes of background
medications take effect. In resistant cases of Lennox-­Gastaut syndrome
and related epilepsies, ketogenic diet, zonisamide, levetiracetam, acetazolamide, methsuximide, corticosteroids, or IVIG can be used.
Dravet syndrome is usually treated with benzodiazepines such as
clobazam and with valproate. The ketogenic diet can also be useful in
patients with this syndrome, including cases with refractory status. Stiripentol, which is available in some countries, is useful, particularly if
used in combination with valproate and clobazam; doses need to be
adjusted because stiripentol can increase clobazam levels, and valproate
can increase stiripentol levels. Other medications include zonisamide
and topiramate. Lamotrigine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and phenytoin are reported to exacerbate seizures in Dravet syndrome. Barbiturate use during status epilepticus in this syndrome is suspected to
be associated with adverse outcomes; consequently, alternative acute
therapies in such cases need to be considered.
The FDA has approved CBD and fenfluramine for the treatment
of seizures associated with Lennox-­
Gastaut syndrome or Dravet
syndrome in patients ≥2 years. The starting dose is 2.5 mg/kg taken
twice daily (5 mg/kg/day). After 1 week, the dose is usually increased
to a maintenance dosage of 5 mg/kg twice daily (10 mg/kg/day). If it
is tolerated and needed, the dose may be increased up to 10 mg/kg
twice daily (20 mg/kg/day). It comes as an oral solution (100 mg/mL).
Checking the package insert of all these medications before initiating
their use is essential because of the frequent interactions with concurrent antiseizure and other medications.
Absence seizures are most often initially treated with ethosuximide,
which is as effective as, but less toxic than, valproate; both are more
effective than lamotrigine (which has fewer side effects than valproate). Alternative drugs of first choice are lamotrigine and valproate,
especially if generalized tonic-­clonic seizures coexist with absence seizures. These two medications are effective against the latter seizures,
whereas ethosuximide is not. Patients resistant to ethosuximide might
still respond to valproate or to lamotrigine. In absence seizures, the
EEG is usually helpful in monitoring the response to therapy and is
often more sensitive than the parents’ observations in detecting these
seizures. The EEG often normalizes when complete seizure control is
achieved. This is usually not true for partial epilepsies. Other medications that could be used for absence seizures include acetazolamide,
zonisamide, or clonazepam.
Benign myoclonic epilepsies are often best treated with valproate,
particularly when patients have associated generalized tonic-­clonic
and absence seizures. Zonisamide, clonazepam, lamotrigine, and topiramate are alternatives.

3608 Part XXV u The Nervous System
Severe myoclonic epilepsies are treated with medications effective
for Lennox-­Gastaut syndromes, such as topiramate, clobazam, valproate, and zonisamide. Levetiracetam may also have efficacy in myoclonic epilepsies.
Focal and focal to bilateral tonic-­clonic seizures can be treated
with oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, carbamazepine, phenobarbital,
topiramate, lacosamide, zonisamide, valproic acid, lamotrigine, clobazam, perampanel, or clonazepam (see Table 633.1). Oxcarbazepine and
levetiracetam are often used first.
Vigabatrin is the preferred treatment for infantile spasms due to
tuberous sclerosis. The FDA also approved CBD and everolimus to
treat a seizure in tuberous sclerosis in patients older than 2 years of age.
For children with ESES and SWS, nighttime benzodiazepine and
daily or pulsed-­dose steroids are preferentially used. Alternatively,
other AEDs like valproate, clobazam, levetiracetam, and acetazolamide
and ketogenic therapy have been used.

CHOICE OF DRUG: OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

Because there are many options for each patient, the choice of which
drug to use is always an individualized decision based on comparative effectiveness data from randomized controlled trials and on several
other considerations delineated next:
• Comparative effectiveness (Tables 633.13 and 633.14 list dosages)
and the potential for paradoxical seizure aggravation by some
AEDs (e.g., precipitation of myoclonic seizures by lamotrigine in
Dravet syndrome and exacerbation of absence seizures by carbamazepine and tiagabine) must be considered. Although many antiseizure medications have not been studied in the pediatric population, off-­label use of these medications in children is common, and
there are studies that have shown that, in general, their efficacy in
adults is predictive of their efficacy in children with the same seizure
types.

• Comparative tolerability (Table 633.15): Adverse effects can vary
according to the profile of the patient. The most prominent example
is the increased risk of liver toxicity for valproate therapy in children
who are younger than 2 years of age, taking polytherapy, and/or have
metabolic disorders. Thus if metabolic disorders are suspected, other
drugs should be considered first, and valproate should not be started
until the metabolic disorders are ruled out by normal amino acids,
organic acids, acylcarnitine profile, lactate, pyruvate, liver function
tests, and perhaps gene testing for mitochondrial disorders (see the
paragraph on the presence of comorbid conditions later). The choice
of an AED can also be influenced by the likelihood of occurrence
of nuisance side effects, such as weight gain (valproate, carbamazepine), gingival hyperplasia (phenytoin), alopecia (valproate), hyperactivity (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, levetiracetam, valproate,
gabapentin), or irritability/anger (levetiracetam and perampanel).
Children with behavior problems and/or with attention-­
deficit
disorder can become particularly hyperactive with the GABAergic
drugs mentioned earlier. This often affects the choice of medications.
In general, newer-­generation antiepileptic medications provide a
better side effect profile than older medications.
• Cost and availability: The cost of the newer AEDs often precludes
their use, particularly in developing countries. Many drugs are not
available in all countries (1) because they are too expensive; (2) because, paradoxically, they are too inexpensive (lower profit margin);
or (3) because of regulatory restrictions. AEDs have a narrow therapeutic range, and thus switching from brand name to generic formulations or from one generic to another can result in changes in levels
that could result in breakthrough seizures or side effects.
• Ease of initiation of the AED: Medications started very gradually,
such as lamotrigine and topiramate, should not be chosen in situations when there is a need to quickly achieve a therapeutic level. In
such situations, medications that have intravenous preparations or

3612 Part XXV u The Nervous System
that can be started and titrated more quickly, such as levetiracetam,
phenytoin, lacosamide, or valproate, should be considered instead.
• Drug interactions and the presence of background medications: An
example is the potential interference of enzyme-­inducing drugs with
many chemotherapeutic agents. In those cases, medications such as
gabapentin or levetiracetam are used. Also, valproate inhibits the
metabolism and increases the levels of lamotrigine, phenobarbital, and felbamate; it also displaces protein-­bound phenytoin from
protein-­binding sites, increasing the free fraction; and thus the free
and not the total level needs to be checked when both medications
are used together. Enzyme inducers such as phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and primidone reduce levels of lamotrigine,
valproate, and, to a lesser extent, topiramate, zonisamide, and perampanel. Medications exclusively excreted by the kidney, such as
levetiracetam and gabapentin, are not subject to such interactions.
• The presence of comorbid conditions: The presence of migraine in
a patient with epilepsy can lead to the choice of a medication that
is effective against both conditions, such as valproate, topiramate,
or zonisamide. In an obese patient, a medication such as valproate
might be avoided, and a medication that decreases the appetite, such
as topiramate or zonisamide, might be used instead. In adolescent
females of child-­bearing potential, enzyme-­inducing AEDs are often avoided because they can interfere with birth control pills; other
AEDs, particularly valproate, can increase risks for fetal malformations. Valproic acid may unmask or exacerbate certain underlying
metabolic disorders; these include nonketotic hyperglycinemia,
DNA polymerase γ pathogenic variant (POLG) with mitochondrial
DNA depletion (also known as Alpers-­Huttenlocher syndrome),
other mitochondrial disorders (Leigh syndrome; MELAS; myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers; myoclonic epilepsy–myopathy–sensory ataxia syndrome), and hyperammonemic encephalopathies. Manifestations may include hepatotoxicity or encephalopathy.
Attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common comorbid condition in children with epilepsy. The presence of epilepsy
should not necessarily discourage treatment with stimulants if indicated.
• Coexisting seizures: In a patient with both absence and generalized
tonic-­clonic seizures, a drug that has a broad spectrum of antiseizure
effects, such as lamotrigine or valproate, could be used rather than
medications that have a narrow spectrum of efficacy, such as phenytoin and ethosuximide.
• History of prior response to specific AEDs: For example, if a patient
or a family member with the same problem had previously responded to levetiracetam, levetiracetam could be a desirable choice.
• Mechanism of drug actions: At present, in most patients the current
understanding of the pathophysiology of epilepsy does not allow a
specific choice of AEDs based on the assumed pathophysiology of
the epilepsy. However, it is believed that it is better to avoid combining medications that have similar mechanisms of action, such as
phenytoin and carbamazepine (both work on sodium channels). A
number of medications, such as lamotrigine and valproate or topiramate and lamotrigine, are reported to have synergistic effects, possibly because they have different mechanisms of action.
• Ease of use: Medications given once or twice a day are easier to use
than medications given 3 or 4 times a day. Availability of a pediatric
liquid preparation, particularly if palatable, also plays a role. Some
drugs are also available as sprinkles and biofilm formulation for use
in children.
• Ability to monitor the medication and adjust the dose: Some medications are difficult to adjust and to follow, requiring frequent blood
levels. The prototype of such medications is phenytoin, but many
of the older medications, such as valproate and phenobarbital, also
require blood level monitoring for optimal titration. Monitoring can
represent a practical or patient satisfaction disadvantage for the older drugs compared with the newer AEDs, which generally require
less blood level monitoring most often to check for compliance.
• Patient’s and family’s preferences: The choice between two or more
acceptable alternative AEDs might also depend on the patient’s or
family’s preferences. For example, some patients might want to avoid

gingival hyperplasia and hirsutism as side effects but might tolerate
weight loss or vice versa.
• Genetics and genetic testing: A genetic predisposition to developing
AED-­induced side effects is another factor that may be a consideration. There is a strong association between the human leukocyte
antigen HLA-­B*1502 allele and severe cutaneous reactions induced
by carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, or lamotrigine in Chinese Han patients and, to a lesser extent, Southeast Asian populations; hence, these AEDs should be avoided in genetically susceptible
persons after testing for the allele. Pathogenic variants of the SCN1A
sodium channel gene indicating Dravet syndrome could also lead to
avoiding lamotrigine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and phenytoin
and to the use of the more appropriate valproate, clobazam, or stiripentol.
• Teratogenic profiles: Based on available evidence, levetiracetam and
lamotrigine are FDA pregnancy category C drugs and probably the
safest AEDs to use during pregnancy. Valproate is a category X drug
that is associated with neural tube defects, hypospadias, and cardiovascular malformations. The use of valproate should thus be avoided
during pregnancy if possible. Topiramate, phenobarbital, and phenytoin are category D drugs with birth defects associated with their use
reported in humans. The decision to transition to a less teratogenic
AED rather than continuing with an existing regimen must be made
on a case-­by-­case basis and consider the risk of seizures during pregnancy versus the risk of teratogenicity.
• Underlying etiology: The cause for the patient’s epilepsy must be
considered and can lead to more specific therapy choices, such as
the use of immune-­modulating therapy for autoimmune encephalopathy or personalized and precision therapies for specific epileptic
channelopathies or vitamin-­responsive epilepsies.

INITIATING AND MONITORING THERAPY

In nonemergency situations or when loading is not necessary, the
maintenance dose of the chosen AED is started (see Table 633.14).
With some medications (e.g., oxcarbazepine, carbamazepine, topiramate, and perampanel), even smaller doses are initially started and
then gradually increased up to the maintenance dose to build a tolerance to adverse effects such as sedation. The starting dose of oxcarbazepine is usually 8-­10 mg/kg/day. Increments of 5 mg/kg/day can be
added every 3 days until a therapeutic level is achieved and therapeutic response is established or until unacceptable adverse effects occur.
With other medications such as zonisamide, phenobarbital, phenytoin,
or valproate, starting at the maintenance dose is usually tolerated. With
some, such as levetiracetam and gabapentin, either approach can be
used. Patients should be counseled about potential adverse effects, and
these should be monitored during follow-­up visits (see Table 633.15).

Titration

Levels of many AEDs should usually be determined after initiation
to ensure compliance and therapeutic concentrations. Monitoring is
most helpful for the older AEDs, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine,
valproate, phenobarbital, and ethosuximide. After starting the maintenance dosage or after any change in the dosage, a steady state is not
reached until 5 half-­lives have elapsed, which, for most AEDs, is 2-­7
days (half-­life: 6-­24 hours). For phenobarbital, it is 2-­4 weeks (mean
half-­life: 69 hours). For zonisamide, it is 14 days during monotherapy
and less than that during polytherapy with enzyme inducers (half-­life:
63 hours in monotherapy and 27-­38 hours during combination therapy
with enzyme inducers). If a therapeutic level has to be achieved faster,
a loading dose may be used for some drugs, usually with a single dose
that is twice the average maintenance dose per half-­life. For valproate,
it is 20 mg/kg; for phenytoin, it is 20 mg/kg; and for phenobarbital, it
is 10-­20 mg/kg. A lower loading dosage of phenobarbital is sometimes
given in older children (5 mg/kg, which may be repeated once or more
in 24 hours) to avoid excessive sedation.
Only one drug should be used initially, and the dose increased
until complete control is achieved or until side effects prohibit further increases. Then, and only then, may another drug be added and

Chapter 633 u Seizures in Childhood 3613
the initial drug subsequently tapered. Control with one drug (monotherapy) should be the goal, although some patients eventually need to
take multiple drugs. When appropriate, levels should also be checked
upon addition (or discontinuation) of a second drug because of potential drug interactions. During follow-­up, repeating the EEG every
few months may be helpful to evaluate changes in the predisposition
to seizures. This is especially true in situations where tapering off of
medication is contemplated in any seizure type and during follow-­up
to assess the response for absence seizures because the EEG mirrors the
response in such patients.

Monitoring

For the older AEDs, before starting treatment, baseline laboratory
studies, including complete blood count, platelets, liver enzymes, and
possibly kidney function tests and urinalysis, are often obtained and
repeated periodically. Laboratory monitoring is more relevant early
on because idiosyncratic adverse effects such as allergic hepatitis and
agranulocytosis are more likely to occur in the first 3-­6 months of therapy. These laboratory studies are usually initially checked once or twice
during the first month, then every 3-­4 months after that. Significant
concerns have been raised about the usefulness of routine monitoring
in the absence of clinical signs because the yield of significant adverse
effects is low. There are currently many advocates of less frequent routine monitoring.
In approximately 10% of patients, a reversible dose-­related leukopenia may occur in patients taking carbamazepine or phenytoin. This
adverse effect responds to decreasing the dose or stopping the medication and is distinguished from the much less common idiosyncratic
aplastic anemia or agranulocytosis. One exception requiring frequent
(even weekly) monitoring of liver function and blood counts throughout the therapy is felbamate, owing to the high incidence of liver and
hematologic toxicity (1 in 500 children under 2 years of age with complex neurologic disorders who are taking the drug). The gum hyperplasia that is seen with phenytoin necessitates good oral hygiene (brushing
teeth at least twice per day and rinsing the mouth after taking the phenytoin); in a few cases, it may be severe enough to warrant surgical
reduction and/or a change of medication. An allergic rash can occur
with any medication but is probably most common with lamotrigine,
carbamazepine, and phenytoin.
Because of the risk of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension with fenfluramine and irreversible peripheral vision
loss with vigabatrin, these drugs are available only through a restricted
distribution REMS program. In addition, the FDA has circulated a
warning about factoring in the possibility of cardiac arrhythmias when
deciding on lamotrigine use, particularly in cardiac patients and the
need to monitor ECG during its use.

SIDE EFFECTS

Occasionally, a Stevens-­Johnson–like syndrome develops, probably
most commonly with lamotrigine but also with other medications like
clobazam; it also has been found to be particularly common in Chinese
patients who have the allele HLA-­B*1502 and are taking oxcarbazepine, carbamazepine, and/or lamotrigine.
Other potential side effects are rickets from phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, and carbamazepine (enzyme inducers that reduce
the 25-­hyrdroxy-­vitamin D level by inducing its metabolism) and
hyperammonemia from valproate. Skeletal monitoring is warranted in
patients taking chronic AED therapy because it is often associated with
osteopenia independent of or secondary to vitamin D deficiency (low
bone density, rickets, and hypocalcemia), particularly in patients taking enzyme-­inducing medications. Thus counseling the patient about
sun exposure and vitamin D intake, monitoring vitamin D levels, and,
in most cases, giving vitamin D supplementation are recommended.
There is currently no consensus on the dose to be used for supplementation or prophylaxis, but starting doses of 2,000 IU/day with follow-­up
of the levels are reasonable.
Irreversible hepatic injury and death are particularly feared in young
children (<2 years old) who are receiving valproate in combination
with other AEDs, particularly those who might have inborn errors of

metabolism such as aminoacidopathies and mitochondrial disease.
Virtually all AEDs can produce sleepiness, ataxia, nystagmus, and
slurred speech with toxic levels.
The FDA has determined that the use of AEDs may be associated
with an increased risk of suicidal ideation and action and has recommended counseling about this side effect before starting these
medications.
When adding a new AED, the doses used are often affected by the
background medications. If the patient is receiving enzyme inducers,
the doses needed of valproate, lamotrigine, topiramate, zonisamide,
and perampanel are often higher, sometimes 1.5-­2 times, than the usual
maintenance doses. On the other hand, if the patient is taking valproate
(an enzyme-­inhibiting AED), the doses of phenobarbital or lamotrigine are approximately half of what is usually needed. Changes in the
dosing of the background medication are often done as the interacting
medication is being started or stopped. Genetic variability in enzymes
that metabolize AEDs and in the presence of inducible multidrug-­
resistance genes (pharmacogenomics) might account for some of the
variation among individuals in responding to certain AEDs and for the
variability in the drug dose necessary for seizure control.

ADDITIONAL TREATMENTS

The principles of monotherapy indicate that a second medication
needs to be considered after the first either is pushed as high as tolerated and still does not control the seizures or results in intolerable
adverse effects. In those cases, a second drug is started and the first is
tapered and then discontinued. The second drug is then again pushed
to the dose that controls the seizure or that results in intolerable side
effects. If the second drug fails, monotherapy with a third drug and
dual (combination) therapy are considered.
Patients with drug-­resistant (previously referred to as intractable or
refractory) epilepsy (those who have failed at least two trials of appropriate medications) warrant a careful diagnostic reevaluation to look
for degenerative, metabolic, or inflammatory underlying disorders (e.g.,
mitochondrial disease, Rasmussen encephalitis; see Chapter 633.2) and
to investigate drug-­resistant patients for candidacy for epilepsy surgery. Treatable metabolic disorders that can manifest as drug-­resistant
epilepsy include pyridoxine-­
dependent and pyridoxal-­
responsive
epilepsy; cerebral folate deficiency; other vitamin-­
responsive conditions (such as biotin/thiamine-­
responsive basal ganglia disease and
riboflavin-­responsive epilepsy); neurotransmitter disorders; biotinidase
deficiency; glucose transporter 1 deficiency (responds to the ketogenic
diet); serine synthesis defects; creatine deficiency syndromes; untreated
phenylketonuria; developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes;
and hyperinsulinemia-­hyperammonemia. Often patients who do not
respond to AEDs are candidates for steroids, IVIG, or the ketogenic diet.
Steroids may be the first-­line treatment in certain cases (e.g., ACTH
use in West syndrome) but may also be used for other drug-­resistant
epilepsy syndromes such as Lennox-­Gastaut, myoclonic-­astatic, continuous spike waves in slow-­wave sleep, and Landau-­Kleffner syndromes. In these situations, steroid therapy is typically given as a
monthly intravenous infusion (pulse steroids) or as daily oral prednisone 2 mg/kg/day (or equivalent). This dose is maintained for 1-­2
months, then tapered off over 1-­3 months. Pulse steroids are usually
better tolerated than a daily steroid regimen, which can cause more
weight gain, hyperglycemia, hypertension, immunosuppression, and
other side effects. Because relapses occur commonly during tapering
and in such syndromes as Landau-­Kleffner and continuous spike waves
in slow-­wave sleep, therapy for longer than 1 year is often needed.
IVIG has also been reported to be similarly effective in nonimmunodeficient patients with West, Lennox-­Gastaut, Landau-­Kleffner, and
continuous spike waves in slow-­wave sleep syndromes and may also have
efficacy in partial seizures. One should check the IgA levels before starting the infusions (to assess the risk for allergic reactions because these
are increased in patients with complete IgA deficiency) and guard against
allergic reactions during the infusion that can occur even in the absence
of IgA deficiency. Low IgA, low IgG2, and male sex are reported to predict a possibly favorable response. The usual regimen is 2 g/kg divided
over 2-­4 consecutive days followed by 1 g/kg once a month for 6 months.

3614 Part XXV u The Nervous System
The mechanisms of action of steroids and IVIG are not known but are
presumed to be antiinflammatory because it has been demonstrated that
seizures increase cytokines and that these, in turn, increase neuronal
excitability by several mechanisms, including activation of glutamate
receptors. Steroids and ACTH might also stimulate brain neurosteroid
receptors that enhance GABA activity and might reduce corticotrophin-­
releasing hormone, which is known to be epileptogenic.
The ketogenic diet is considered effective in glucose transporter
protein 1 deficiency (GLUT-­1), pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency,
myoclonic-­astatic epilepsy, tuberous sclerosis complex, Rett syndrome,
severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (Dravet syndrome), and infantile spasms. There is also a suggestion of possible efficacy in selected
mitochondrial disorders—glycogenosis type V, Landau-­Kleffner syndrome, Lafora body disease, and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.
The diet is absolutely contraindicated in carnitine deficiency (primary),
carnitine palmitoyltransferase I or II deficiency, carnitine translocase
deficiency, β-­
oxidation defects, medium-­
chain acyl dehydrogenase
deficiency, long-­
chain acyl dehydrogenase deficiency, short-­
chain
acyl dehydrogenase deficiency, long-­chain 3-­hydroxyacyl-­coenzyme
A deficiency, medium-­chain 3-­hydroxyacyl–coenzyme A deficiency,
pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, and porphyrias. Thus an appropriate
metabolic workup, depending on the clinical picture, usually needs to
be performed before starting the diet (e.g., acyl carnitine profile, total
and free carnitine levels). The diet has been used for refractory seizures
of various types (partial or generalized) and consists of an initial period
of fasting followed by a diet with a 3:1 or 4:1 fat:nonfat calorie ratio,
with fats consisting of animal fat, vegetable oils, or medium-­chain triglycerides. Many patients do not tolerate it, owing to diarrhea, vomiting, hypoglycemia, dehydration, or lack of palatability. Diets such as
the low-­glycemic-­index diet and the modified Atkins diet are easier to

institute, do not require hospitalization, and may also be effective in
treating epilepsy.
CBD is a nonpsychoactive extract of the cannabis plant that has
gained prominence as a possible adjunct (add-­on) therapy for drug-­
resistant epilepsies such as Dravet and Lennox-­Gastaut syndromes.
Precision genetic-­based therapy is defined as a patient-­specific, or
more accurately physiology-­specific, selection of therapy as determined
by the available information regarding the underlying pathophysiology
based on the primary specific genetic, metabolic, and/or other cause of
epilepsy in that patient. The use of precision therapies (Table 633.16) has
expanded as more epileptogenic gene pathogenic variants are identified
as part of routine genetic screening for drug-­resistant epilepsies. This has
allowed for targeted therapy based on the specific gene variant (see Table
633.16). Examples include the use of quinidine for gain-­of-­function
KCNT1 variants and retigabine for loss-­of-­function KCNQ2 variants.
Gain-­of-­function KCNQ2 variants do not respond to retigabine, a fact
that emphasizes the need for careful gene analysis that accounts for the
functional outcome of each particular gene. The same applies to pathogenic variants of sodium channels; patients with epilepsy caused by gain-­
of-­function variants show good response to sodium channel–blocking
agents, a response not shared by patients with epilepsy caused by loss-­of-­
function variants in the sodium channel gene.
Vitamin-­responsive epilepsies also warrant special attention because
if they are diagnosed early and precision therapy is given for them, the
therapy can significantly affect seizure control and neurodevelopmental
outcomes. Examples include the use of pyridoxine for antiquitin deficiency–associated epilepsies, biotin for biotinidase deficiency, folate for
cerebral folate deficiency, and biotin/thiamine for biotin thiamine–
responsive basal ganglia disease, which can have coexisting epilepsy
and is caused by defects in a cerebral thiamine transporter.

Chapter 633 u Seizures in Childhood 3615
APPROACH TO EPILEPSY SURGERY

If a patient has failed three drugs, the chance of achieving seizure freedom using AEDs is <10%. Therefore proper evaluation for surgery is
necessary when a patient fails two or three AEDs, usually within 2
years of the onset of epilepsy and often sooner than 2 years. Performing epilepsy surgery in children at an earlier stage (e.g., <5 years of
age) allows the transfer of function in the developing brain. Candidacy for epilepsy surgery requires proof of resistance to AEDs used at
maximum, tolerably nontoxic doses; absence of expected unacceptable
adverse consequences of surgery; and a properly defined epileptogenic
zone (the area that needs to be resected to achieve seizure freedom).
The epileptogenic zone is identified by careful analysis of the following
parameters: seizure semiology, video-­EEG long-­term monitoring, neuropsychologic profile, and brain MRI. 7-­Tesla MRI may, in some cases,
have some advantage over 3-­Tesla MRI. Other techniques, such as high-­
density EEG (HD-­EEG), invasive EEG (depth electrodes, subdural grid
or strips, intraoperative electrocorticography), single-­photon emission
CT (SPECT), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and positron emission
tomography (PET), are also needed if the epileptogenic zone is difficult
to localize or when it is close to the eloquent cortex. Stereo-­EEG is a
method of invasive EEG monitoring used to localize epileptic areas of
the cortex. It involves the stereotactic implantation of depth electrodes
through multiple burr holes in the skull using robot-­assisted implantations and computer-­based 3D localization. Several procedures can be
used to avoid resection of eloquent cortex, including the Wada test,
functional MRI, MEG, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and cortical
stimulation with subdural and depth electrodes. Developmental delay
or psychiatric diseases must be considered in assessing the potential
impact of surgery on the patient. The usual minimal presurgical evaluation includes video-­EEG monitoring, brain imaging, and age-­specific
neuropsychologic assessment.
Epilepsy surgery is often used to treat drug-­resistant epilepsy of a
number of etiologies, including cortical dysplasia, tuberous sclerosis, polymicrogyria, hypothalamic hamartoma, encephalomalacia

from prior cerebrovascular insult, mesial temporal sclerosis, Landau-­
Kleffner syndrome, and hemispheric syndromes such as Sturge-­Weber
syndrome, hemimegalencephaly, and Rasmussen encephalitis. Patients
with drug-­resistant epilepsy resulting from metabolic or degenerative
problems are not candidates for resective epilepsy surgery. Focal resection of the epileptogenic zone is the most common procedure. Hemispherectomy is used for diffuse hemispheric lesions in cases such as
Rasmussen encephalitis, hemimegalencephaly, large perinatal stroke,
Sturge-­Weber syndrome; multiple subpial transections, a surgical
technique in which the horizontal connections of the epileptic focus
are partially cut without resecting it, is sometimes used for unresectable foci located in the eloquent cortex, as in Landau-­Kleffner syndrome. In Lennox-­Gastaut syndrome, corpus callosotomy is used as
a palliative procedure for drop attacks.
Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a less invasive surgical technique that uses a laser to ablate relatively small (<3 × 3 cm)
epileptic areas in the cortex; it has been used to treat mesial temporal
sclerosis, tuberous sclerosis, and hypothalamic hamartomas and for
corpus callosotomies. Other minimally invasive techniques include
gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery that uses gamma radiation.
Focal resection and hemispherectomy result in a high rate (50–80%)
of seizure freedom. Corpus callosotomy and vagal nerve stimulation
result in lower rates of seizure freedom (5–10% for vagus nerve stimulation [VNS] and lower for callosotomy); however, these procedures
do result in significant reductions in the frequency and severity of seizures, decreases in medication requirements, and meaningful improvements in the patient’s quality of life in approximately half or more of
eligible patients.
VNS is often used for drug-­resistant epilepsies of various types (partial, generalized, Lennox-­Gastaut) and for seizures of diffuse focal or
multifocal anatomic origin that do not yield themselves to resective
surgery (Fig. 633.10). VNS is approved for age 4 years and above but
has also been used in even younger ages. This technique is considered
palliative rather than curative because it most often leads to seizure

frequency reduction rather than seizure cessation. By producing low-­
amplitude current stimulations, usually once every 5 minutes, this
device results in a reduction of seizures. Also, caretakers can activate
the device by swiping a magnet over it at the time of the seizure, which
can shorten seizure duration. Vagus nerve stimulators also have integrated heart rate monitoring that detects tachycardia patterns typically
associated with seizures and then activates the stimulator during these
times. Responsive neurostimulation (RNS) is a technique that has
been used in adults with epilepsy; it requires the implantation of subdural or depth electrodes to directly monitor seizure activity on a long-­
term basis to detect and abort the seizures. Once a seizure is detected,
electrical stimulation is delivered to that area of the brain to stop the
seizure. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is approved for refractory partial epilepsy in adults. In DBS, the electrical stimulation is provided by
two stereotactically placed electrodes in bilateral thalamic nuclei (anterior nuclei for focal epilepsy and centromedian nuclei, as being studied,
in generalized epilepsies).

DISCONTINUATION OF THERAPY

Discontinuation of AEDs is usually indicated when otherwise well
children are free of seizures for at least 2 years. In more severe syndromes, such as temporal lobe epilepsy secondary to mesial temporal
sclerosis, Lennox-­Gastaut syndrome, or severe myoclonic epilepsy, a
prolonged period of seizure freedom with treatment is often warranted
before AEDs are withdrawn, if withdrawal is attempted at all. In self-­
limited (benign) epilepsy syndromes, the duration of therapy can often
be as short as 6 months.
Many factors should be considered before discontinuing medications, including the likelihood of remaining seizure-­free after drug
withdrawal based on the type of epilepsy syndrome and etiology; the
risk of injury in case of seizure recurrence (e.g., if the patient drives);
and the adverse effects of AED therapy. Most children who have not
had a seizure for 2 years or longer and who have a normal EEG when
AED withdrawal is initiated remain free of seizures after discontinuing
medication, and most relapses occur within the first 6 months.
Certain risk factors can help clinicians predict the prognosis after
AED withdrawal. The most important risk factor for seizure relapse
is an abnormal EEG before medication is discontinued. Children who
have remote structural (symptomatic) epilepsy are less likely to be able
to stop AEDs than are children who have a benign (idiopathic) epilepsy.
In patients with absences or in patients treated with valproate or other
medications for primary generalized epilepsy, the risk of relapse might
be high despite a normal EEG because valproate (and less so other AEDs
for primary generalized epilepsy) can normalize EEGs with generalized
spike-­wave abnormalities. Thus in these patients, repeating the EEG
during drug tapering may help identify a recurrence of the EEG abnormality and associated seizure risk before clinical seizures recur. Older
age of epilepsy onset, longer duration of epilepsy, presence of multiple
seizure types, and need to use more than one AED are all factors associated with a higher risk of seizure relapse after AED withdrawal.
AED therapy should be discontinued gradually, often over a period
of 3-­6 months, but many advocate for shorter periods down to 6 weeks.
Abrupt discontinuation can result in withdrawal seizures or in status
epilepticus. Withdrawal seizures are especially common with phenobarbital and benzodiazepines; consequently, special attention must be
given to a prolonged tapering schedule during the withdrawal of these
AEDs. Seizures that occur more than 2-­3 months after AEDs are completely discontinued indicate a relapse, and resumption of treatment is
usually warranted. Seizures that occur before that, such as during or
shortly after a medication taper, may be withdrawal seizures or may
indicate a relapse.
The decision to attempt AED withdrawal must be assessed mutually
by the clinician, the parents, and the child depending on the child’s
age. The American Academy of Neurology in collaboration with the
American Epilepsy Society has developed guidelines regarding such
withdrawals. In addition, there is an online risk calculator tool that
has been generated based on clinical nomograms from an independent
participant data meta-­analysis. This tool can be used, with caution, as
an aid to estimate risk of recurrence, but individualized decision based

Table 633.17  Measures in Clinical Practice to Reduce the
Risk of SUDEP
Counseling: Explaining SUDEP and risk factors is imperative, even if
the discussion may be uncomfortable. Emphasize modifiable risk
factors, such as compliance with taking medication.
Reduction of tonic-­clonic seizures: Optimum treatment, good drug
compliance, lifestyle advice (e.g., alcohol intake, sleep deprivation).
Treatment changes: Change in a gradually staged manner; when
switching drugs, introduce the new drug before withdrawing the
old drug; the patient should have access to immediate advice in
the event of worsening seizures during periods of change.
Supervision at night for patients at high risk: Attendance, use
of alarms (balancing the benefits of independent living and the
penalties of intrusive monitoring).
Choice of drugs: Caution with AEDs with potential cardiorespiratory
adverse effects.
Act on ictal warning signs: Tonic-­clonic seizures that are prolonged,
associated with marked cyanosis, severe bradycardia or apnea, and
postictal EEG suppression; complex partial seizures with marked
atonia (drop attacks); seizure in those with preexisting cardiac or
respiratory impairment.
Supervision after a tonic-­clonic seizure: Continuous attendance until
full consciousness is restored; call emergency services for high-­risk
seizures.

on each case’s particulars and on the discussions with the caretakers
should be the final guide in planning the course of care. The patient and
family should be counseled fully on what to expect, what precautions
to take (e.g., cessation of driving for a period), and what to do in case
of relapse. A prescription for rectal diazepam or intranasal midazolam
to be given at the time of seizures that might occur during and after
tapering is usually warranted (see Table 633.23 for dosing).

SUDDEN UNEXPECTED DEATH IN EPILEPSY

SUDEP is the most common epilepsy-­related cause of mortality and
is responsible for up to 17% of deaths in patients with epilepsy. Risk
factors include polytherapy with more than three AEDs, male gender,
young age at epilepsy onset, developmental delay, poor AED compliance, nocturnal seizures, poorly controlled convulsive seizures (especially if >3 per year), high frequency of seizures (especially if >50 per
year), and having epilepsy for >30 years in adults. Patients are usually
found dead in their bed in a prone position, with evidence suggesting
a recent seizure.
Respiratory, cardiogenic, and mixed respiratory/cardiogenic mechanisms have been hypothesized to cause SUDEP. Respiratory models
include seizure-­induced central hypoventilation, neurogenic pulmonary edema, and disturbances in the brainstem serotonergic system
leading to respiratory arrest. Cardiogenic models include seizure-­
induced cardiac arrhythmia as well as cardiocerebral channelopathies
in which ion channels are expressed in both the brain and heart, causing cardiac dysfunction concurrent with the seizures. SCN1A, SNC8A,
ATP1A3, and KCNQ1 are examples of genes that encode for cardiocerebral ion channels known to cause epilepsy and that have also been
associated with SUDEP. Mixed respiratory/cardiogenic models include
seizure-­induced dysautonomia, high adenosine levels during seizure
causing cardiorespiratory collapse, and spreading depression in the
brainstem causing dysautonomia. More data are needed to determine
if safety pillows, seizure detection devices, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be of benefit in preventing SUDEP. It is currently
recommended to counsel the patients and family regarding SUDEP, even
if the topic is not comfortable to talk about. In addition to providing
them with important information, such counseling may also encourage
families to address modifiable risk factors such as AED compliance.

Chapter 633 u Seizures in Childhood 3617

633.7 Neonatal Seizures
Mohamad A. Mikati and Monica E. Lemmon
Seizures are possibly the most important and common indicator of
significant neurologic dysfunction in the neonatal period. Seizure
incidence is higher during this period than in any other period of life:
seizures occur in 57.5 per 1,000 in infants with birthweights <1,500 g
and 2.8 per 1,000 in infants weighing between 2,500 and 3,999 g. The
etiology of neonatal seizures depends on postnatal age of onset (Fig.
633.11, Table 633.18) as well as EEG and clinical features (Fig. 633.12,
Table 633.18 and Table 633.19).

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

The immature brain has many differences from the mature brain that
render it more excitable and more likely to develop seizures. Based
predominantly on animal studies, these include a delay in Na+, K+-­
adenosine triphosphatase maturation and increased NMDA and
AMPA receptor density. In addition, the specific types of these receptors that are increased are those that are permeable to calcium (GLUR2
AMPA receptors). This contributes to increased excitability and to the
long-­term consequences associated with seizures, particularly those
resulting from perinatal hypoxia. Medications that block AMPA receptors, such as topiramate, may thus prove useful in this clinical scenario.
Another difference is delay in the development of inhibitory GABA­
ergic transmission. In fact, GABA in the immature brain has an excitatory function because the chloride gradient is reversed relative to the
mature brain, with higher concentrations of chloride being present
intracellularly than extracellularly. Thus opening of the chloride channels in the immature brain results in depolarizing the cell and not in
hyperpolarizing it. How applicable this is to human neonates and, if so,
at what conceptional ages, is not clear yet. This phenomenon, however,

hr of life are hypoxic-­ischemic encephalopathy or vascular etiologies, followed by acute metabolic disturbances such as hypoglycemia or inborn
errors of metabolism such as pyridoxine dependency. Within the next
24-­72 hr, the main etiologies include infection, cortical malformations,
cerebral infarction, inborn errors of metabolism such as glycine encephalopathy, urea cycle disturbances, pyridoxine dependency, and benign
familial neonatal seizures. Over the next 72 hr to a week, causes include
cortical malformations, cerebral infarction or hemorrhage, or inborn errors of metabolism, such as urea cycle disturbances. In the next 1-­4 wk,
the differential includes cortical malformations, viral infections such as
herpes simplex, or genetic epilepsy syndromes. (From Kim EH, Shin J,

and classification. Clin Exp Pediatr. 2022;65[8]:387–397, Fig. 1, p. 389.)

appears to be more prominent in male neonates, perhaps explaining
their greater predisposition to seizures.

TYPES OF NEONATAL SEIZURES

There are two main neonatal seizure types: electroclinical and electrographic only. Electroclinical seizures can be categorized as motor,
nonmotor, and sequential. Motor seizures include automatisms, clonic
seizures, epileptic spasms, myoclonic seizures, and tonic seizures. Nonmotor seizures include autonomic seizures and behavioral arrest (see

Chapter 633 u Seizures in Childhood 3619
clinical appearance alone is challenging. Thus in many cases, specifically in sick neonates with a history of suspected neurologic injury,
continuous bedside EEG is necessary to make this distinction.

These are most commonly associated with genetic epilepsies, including
KCNQ2 encephalopathy.

Motor Seizures
Automatisms

Jitteriness can be defined as rapid motor activities, such as a tremor or
shake, that can be ended by flexion or holding the limb. Seizures generally do not end with tactile or motor suppression. Jitteriness, unlike
most seizures, is usually induced by a stimulus. Unlike jitteriness, seizures often involve eye deviation and autonomic changes.

Automatisms include transient eye deviations, nystagmus, blinking,
mouthing, and abnormal extremity movements (rowing, swimming,
bicycling, pedaling, and stepping). Automatisms occur more commonly in premature than in full-­term infants.

Clonic Seizures

Clonic seizures can be focal or multifocal. Multifocal clonic seizures
incorporate several body parts and are migratory in nature. The migration follows a non-­Jacksonian trend; for example, jerking of the left
arm can be associated with jerking of the right leg. Generalized clonic
seizures that are bilateral, symmetric, and synchronous are uncommon
in the neonatal period, presumably because of decreased connectivity
associated with incomplete myelination at this age.

Epileptic Spasms

Epileptic spasms are sudden generalized jerks lasting 1-­2 seconds that
are distinguished from generalized tonic spells by their shorter duration and by the fact that spasms are usually associated with a single,
very brief, generalized discharge.

Myoclonic Seizures

Myoclonic seizures are divided into focal, multifocal, and generalized
types. Myoclonic seizures can be distinguished from clonic seizures by
the rapidity of the jerks (<50 milliseconds) and by their lack of rhythmicity. Focal myoclonic seizures characteristically affect the flexor muscles of the upper extremities and are sometimes associated with seizure
activity on EEG. Multifocal myoclonic movements involve asynchronous twitching of several parts of the body and are not commonly associated with seizure discharges on EEG. Generalized myoclonic seizures
involve bilateral jerking associated with flexion of the upper and occasionally lower extremities. The latter type of myoclonic jerks is more
commonly correlated with EEG abnormalities than the other types.

Tonic Seizures

Tonic seizures can be focal or generalized (generalized are more common). Focal tonic seizures include persistent posturing of a limb or
posturing of the trunk or neck in an asymmetric way, often with persistent horizontal eye deviation. Generalized tonic seizures are bilateral tonic limb extensions or tonic flexions of the upper extremities
often associated with tonic extension of the lower extremities and
trunk.

Nonmotor Seizures
Autonomic

Autonomic seizures involve fluctuations in autonomic system function, including alterations in the cardiovascular, vasomotor, pupillary, and thermoregulatory function. These seizures may include heart
rate changes, hypertension episodes, and apnea. Autonomic seizures
typically accompany additional seizure types and are rarely seen in
isolation.

Behavioral Arrest

Behavioral arrest seizures include cessation of activity or immobilization. This seizure type is rarely seen in isolation and can be seen as a
component of sequential seizures.

Sequential

Sequential seizures have been defined by the ILAE as a seizure type
for “events with a sequent of signs, symptoms, and EEG changes at different times.” An example would be a sequence of tonic, then clonic,
then automatisms, and autonomic manifestations with varying lateralization during one seizure. In these seizures, it can be challenging to
define the predominant semiology, and features present in a sequence.

Seizures Versus Jitteriness

ETIOLOGY

Table 633.18 and Table 633.20 and Figure 633.11 list causes of neonatal
seizures.

Hypoxic-­Ischemic Encephalopathy

This is the most common cause of neonatal seizures, accounting for
50–60% of patients. Seizures secondary to this encephalopathy occur
within 24 hours of birth. Abnormal EEG background, including excessive discontinuity, burst suppression, and extremely low voltage patterns, are strongly associated with the development of seizures.

Vascular Events

These include intracranial bleeds and ischemic strokes and account for
10–20% of patients. Three types of hemorrhage can be distinguished:
primary subarachnoid hemorrhage, germinal matrix–intraventricular
hemorrhage, and subdural hemorrhage. Patients with arterial strokes
or venous sinus thrombosis can present with seizure, and these can be
diagnosed by neuroimaging. Venous sinus thrombosis could be missed
unless MR or CT venography studies are requested.

Intracranial Infections

Bacterial and nonbacterial infections account for 5–10% of the cases of
neonatal seizures and include bacterial meningitis, TORCH (toxoplasmosis, other infections, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus)
infections, and, particularly, herpes simplex encephalitis.

Brain Malformations

Brain malformations account for 5–10% of neonatal seizure cases. An
example is Aicardi syndrome, which affects girls only and consists of
retinal lacunae, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and severe seizures,
including subsequent infantile spasms with hypsarrhythmia that is
sometimes initially unilateral on EEG.

Metabolic Disturbances

Metabolic disturbances include disturbances in glucose, calcium, magnesium, other electrolytes, amino acids, or organic acids and pyridoxine dependency (Table 633.21).
Hypoglycemia can cause neurologic disturbances and is common
in small neonates and neonates whose mothers are diabetic or prediabetic. The duration of hypoglycemia is very critical in determining the
incidence of neurologic symptoms.
Hypocalcemia occurs with two peaks. The first peak corresponds to low
birthweight infants and is evident in the first 2-­3 days of life. The second
peak occurs later in neonatal life and often involves large, full-­term babies
who consume milk that has an unfavorable ratio of phosphorus to calcium
and phosphorus to magnesium. Hypomagnesemia is often associated
with hypocalcemia. Hyponatremia can cause seizures and is often secondary to inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion or water intoxication.
Local anesthetic intoxication seizures can result from neonatal
intoxication with local anesthetics that are inadvertently administered
into the infant’s scalp.
Neonatal seizures can also result from disturbances in amino acid
or organic acid metabolism. These are usually associated with acidosis
and/or hyperammonemia. However, even in the absence of these findings, if a cause of the seizures is not immediately evident, then ruling out
metabolic causes requires a full metabolic workup (see Chapter 633.2),
including examination of serum amino acids, acyl carnitine profile,
lactate, pyruvate, ammonia, very long-­chain fatty acids (for neonatal
adrenoleukodystrophy and Zellweger syndrome), examination of urine

for organic acids, α-­aminoadipic acid semialdehyde, and sulfocysteine,
as well as examination of CSF for glucose, protein, cells, amino acids,
lactate, pyruvate, α-­aminoadipic acid semialdehyde, pyridoxal phosphate, 5-­
methyltetrahydrofolate (5-­
MTHF), succinyladenosine, and
CSF neurotransmitter metabolites. This is because many inborn errors
of metabolism, such as nonketotic hyperglycinemia, can manifest with
neonatal seizures (often mistaken initially for hiccups, which these
patients also have) and can be detected only by performing these tests.
Definitive diagnosis of nonketotic hyperglycinemia, for example,
requires measuring the ratio of CSF glycine to plasma glycine.
Pyridoxine-­and pyridoxal-­dependency disorders can cause severe
seizures. These seizures, which are often multifocal clonic, usually start
during the first few hours of life. Cognitive impairment is often associated if therapy is delayed (see Chapter 633.4).

Drug Withdrawal

Seizures can rarely be caused by the neonate’s passive addiction and
then drug withdrawal after birth. Such drugs include narcotic analgesics, sedative-­hypnotics, and others. The associated seizures appear
during the first 3 days of life.

Neonatal Seizure Genetic Syndromes

Seizure syndromes include benign neonatal convulsions (fifth-­day
fits), which are usually apneic, and focal motor seizures that start around

the fifth day of life (see Table 633.20). Interictal EEG shows a distinctive
pattern called theta pointu alternant (runs of sharp 4-­to 7-­Hz activity),
and ictal EEG shows multifocal electrographic seizures. Patients have a
good response to medications and a good prognosis. Autosomal dominant benign familial neonatal seizures have an onset at 2-­4 days of age
and usually remit at 2-­15 weeks of age. The seizures consist of ocular
deviation, tonic posturing, clonic jerks, and, at times, motor automatisms. Interictal EEG is usually normal. These are caused by pathogenic
variants in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3. Approximately 16% of patients develop
later epilepsy. Early myoclonic encephalopathy and early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (Ohtahara syndrome) are discussed in Chapter
633.4.

Miscellaneous Conditions

Miscellaneous conditions include benign neonatal sleep myoclonus
and hyperekplexia, which are nonepileptic conditions (see Chapter
634).

DIAGNOSIS

Some cases can be correctly diagnosed by simply taking the prenatal and postnatal history and performing an adequate physical
examination; however, the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society
Guidelines for Neonatal EEG Monitoring recommend EEG monitoring in cases where there is a clinical concern for seizure and/or when

an infant has a condition that predisposes the infant to seizures. EEG
monitoring can show epileptiform activity (e.g., sharp waves) between
the seizures (suggesting an increased risk for seizures) and confirm
electrographic seizure activity if a clinical seizure is recorded. Additionally, EEG monitoring is often necessary because electrographic
seizures can occur without observed clinical signs (electroclinical
dissociation). This is presumed to be caused by the immaturity of
cortical connections, resulting, in many cases, in no or minimal clinical manifestations.
Continuous bedside EEG monitoring in the neonatal intensive care
unit is the preferred clinical practice for neonates at risk for neonatal
seizures and brain injury. Amplitude-­integrated EEG (aEEG) monitoring is also used as an adjunct to conventional EEG monitoring and
provides a bedside graphic representation of a neonate’s electrocerebral
activity, which may aid in earlier seizure identification. Appropriately
trained nurses and providers can identify possible seizure activity
using aEEG and can then contact the neurophysiologist to confirm
the presence or absence of seizures. Examples of situations in which
continuous EEG monitoring should be used include cases of hypoxic-­
ischemic injury (particularly if an infant is undergoing therapeutic
hypothermia), intracranial infarct or hemorrhage, or CNS infection;

for seizure screening in infants receiving paralytics; in infants with
congenital cerebral malformations; and/or in infants in whom clinical
events suspected to be seizures need to be characterized.
Careful neurologic examination of the infant might uncover the
cause of the seizure disorder. Examination of the retina might show
the presence of chorioretinitis, suggesting a congenital TORCH infection, in which case titers of mother and infant are indicated. Aicardi
syndrome is associated with coloboma of the iris and retinal lacunae.
Inspection of the skin might show hypopigmented lesions characteristic of tuberous sclerosis (seen best on ultraviolet light examination)
or the typical crusted vesicular lesions of incontinentia pigmenti; both
neurocutaneous syndromes are often associated with generalized myoclonic seizures beginning early in life. An unusual body or urine odor
suggests an inborn error of metabolism.
Blood should be obtained for determinations of glucose, calcium,
magnesium, electrolytes, and blood urea nitrogen. If hypoglycemia is a
possibility, bedside serum glucose testing is indicated so that treatment
can be initiated immediately. Hypocalcemia can occur in isolation or
in association with hypomagnesemia. A lowered serum calcium level
is often associated with birth trauma or a CNS insult in the perinatal period. Additional causes include maternal diabetes, prematurity,

3622 Part XXV u The Nervous System
DiGeorge syndrome, and high-­phosphate feedings. Hypomagnesemia (<1.5 mg/dL) is often associated with hypocalcemia and occurs
particularly in infants of malnourished mothers. In this situation, the
seizures are resistant to calcium therapy but respond to intramuscular
magnesium 0.2 mL/kg of a 50% solution of MgSO4. Serum electrolyte
measurement can indicate significant hyponatremia (serum sodium
<115 mEq/L) or hypernatremia (serum sodium >160 mEq/L) as a
cause of the seizure disorder.
A lumbar puncture may be indicated in neonates with seizures,
unless the cause is obviously related to a metabolic disorder (such as
hypoglycemia or hypocalcemia) or attributable to a structural etiology such as hypoxic-­ischemic injury or intracranial hemorrhage. The
CSF findings can indicate a bacterial meningitis or aseptic encephalitis.
Prompt diagnosis and appropriate therapy improve the outcome for
these infants. Bloody CSF indicates a traumatic tap or a subarachnoid
or intraventricular bleed. Immediate centrifugation of the specimen
can assist in differentiating the two disorders. A clear supernatant
suggests a traumatic tap, and a xanthochromic color suggests a subarachnoid bleed. Mildly jaundiced normal infants can have a yellowish
discoloration of the CSF that makes inspection of the supernatant less
reliable in the newborn period.
Many inborn errors of metabolism cause generalized convulsions
in the newborn period. Because these conditions are often inherited
in an autosomal recessive or X-­linked recessive fashion, it is imperative that a careful family history be obtained to determine if there is
consanguinity or whether siblings or close relatives developed seizures
or died at an early age. Serum ammonia determination is useful for
screening for the hypoglycemic hyperammonemia syndrome and for
suspected urea cycle abnormalities. In addition to having generalized
clonic seizures, these latter infants present during the first few days of
life with increasing lethargy progressing to coma, anorexia and vomiting, and a bulging fontanel. If the blood gases show an anion gap and
a metabolic acidosis with the hyperammonemia, urine organic acids
should be immediately determined to investigate the possibility of an
organic acidemia such as methylmalonic or propionic acidemia.
Maple syrup urine disease should be suspected when a metabolic
acidosis occurs in association with generalized clonic seizures, vomiting, a bulging fontanel, and muscle rigidity during the first week of life.
The result of a rapid screening test using 2,4-­dinitrophenylhydrazine
that identifies keto derivatives in the urine is positive in maple syrup
urine disease.
Additional metabolic causes of neonatal seizures include nonketotic hyperglycinemia, an intractable condition characterized by
markedly elevated plasma and CSF glycine levels, prominent hiccups,
persistent generalized seizures, and lethargy rapidly leading to coma;
ketotic hyperglycinemia in which seizures are associated with vomiting, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, and a metabolic acidosis; and
Leigh disease, suggested by elevated levels of serum and CSF lactate
or an increased lactate:pyruvate ratio. Biotinidase deficiency should
also be considered. A comprehensive description of the diagnosis and
management of these metabolic diseases is discussed in Part IX, Metabolic Disorders.
Unintentional injection of a local anesthetic into a fetus during labor can produce intense tonic seizures. These infants are often
thought to have had a traumatic delivery because they are flaccid at
birth, have abnormal brainstem reflexes, and show signs of respiratory
depression that sometimes require ventilation. Examination may show
a needle puncture of the skin or a perforation or laceration of the scalp.
An elevated serum anesthetic level confirms the diagnosis. The treatment consists of supportive measures and promotion of urine output
by administering intravenous fluids with appropriate monitoring to
prevent fluid overload.
Benign familial neonatal seizures, an autosomal dominant condition, begins on the second to third day of life, with a seizure frequency of 10-­20/day. Patients are normal between seizures, which
stop in 1-­6 months. These are caused by pathogenic variants in the
voltage-­sensitive potassium channel genes Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 (KCNQ2
and KCNQ3). Other variants in Kv7.2 cause severe neonatal epileptic encephalopathy. Fifth-­day fits occur on day 5 of life (4-­6 days) in

normal-­appearing neonates. The seizures are multifocal and are often
present for <24 hours. The diagnosis requires exclusion of other causes
of seizures and sequencing of the previously mentioned genes. The
prognosis is good for the benign form.
Pyridoxine dependency, a rare disorder, must be considered when
seizures begin shortly after birth with signs of fetal distress in utero
and are resistant to conventional anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital or phenytoin even if there is an initial treatment response. The
history may suggest that similar seizures occurred in utero. When
pyridoxine-­dependent seizures are suspected, 100 mg of pyridoxine
should be administered intravenously during the EEG, which should
be promptly performed once the diagnosis is considered. The seizures
abruptly cease, and the EEG often normalizes in the next few hours or
longer. Not all cases of pyridoxine dependency respond dramatically to
the initial bolus of intravenous pyridoxine. Therefore a 6-­week trial of
oral pyridoxine (100-­200 mg/day) or, preferably, pyridoxal phosphate
(because pyridoxine does not help infants with the related but distinct
syndrome of pyridoxal dependency) is recommended for infants in
whom a high index of suspicion continues after a negative response
to intravenous pyridoxine. Measurement of serum pipecolic acid and
α-­aminoadipic acid semialdehyde (elevated) and CSF pyridoxal-­5-­
phosphate (decreased) needs to be performed before initiation of the
trials without delay. These children require lifelong supplementation
of oral pyridoxine (100 mg/day at times with folinic acid) or pyridoxal
phosphate (up to 50 mg/kg/day given every 6 hours). Cerebral folate
deficiency should also be ruled out by a medication trial (folinic acid
1-­3 mg/kg/day) and by CSF levels of 5-­methyltetrahydrofolate assay.
Gene sequencing can confirm the diagnosis (see Chapter 633.4). The
earlier the therapy is initiated in these vitamin-­responsive disorders,
the more favorable the outcome.
Drug withdrawal seizures can occur in the newborn nursery but
can take several weeks to develop because of prolonged excretion of
the drug by the neonate. Drugs include barbiturates, benzodiazepines,
heroin, buprenorphine, fentanyl, and methadone. The infant may be
jittery, irritable, and lethargic and can have myoclonus or frank clonic
seizures. The mother might deny the use of drugs; a serum or urine
drug screen might identify the responsible agent.
Infants with focal seizures, suspected stroke or intracranial hemorrhage, and severe cytoarchitectural abnormalities of the brain (including lissencephaly and schizencephaly) who clinically may appear
normal or microcephalic should undergo MRI or CT scan. Indeed, it is
appropriate to recommend imaging of all neonates with seizures unexplained by serum glucose, calcium, or electrolyte disorders.

PROGNOSIS

The prognosis of neonatal seizures has improved owing to advancements in obstetric and intensive neonatal care but depends on the
etiology and other organ system injury. Prematurity and high seizure
burden have been shown to be associated with early death. The correlation between EEG findings and prognosis is clear. An abnormal EEG
background is a powerful predictor of a less favorable later outcome.
In addition, prolonged electrographic seizures (>10 min/hr), multifocal periodic electrographic discharges, and spread of the electrographic
seizures to the contralateral hemisphere are also correlated with a
poorer outcome. Patients with seizures secondary to severe hypoxic-­
ischemic encephalopathy have a 50% chance of typical development,
whereas those with seizures caused by primary subarachnoid hemorrhage or hypocalcemia have a much better prognosis.

TREATMENT

A mainstay in the therapy of neonatal seizures is the diagnosis and
treatment of the underlying etiology (e.g., HIE, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, meningitis, drug withdrawal, trauma) whenever one can
be identified. There are conflicting approaches regarding the control
of neonatal seizures. Most experts advocate complete control of electroclinical and electrographic seizures. An important consideration
before starting anticonvulsants is deciding, based on the severity,
duration, and frequency of the seizures, if the patient needs to receive
intravenous therapy and loading with an initial bolus or can simply

Chapter 633 u Seizures in Childhood 3623
be started on maintenance doses of a long-­acting drug. Patients may
require assisted ventilation after receiving intravenous or oral loading
doses of AEDs, and thus precautions for observations and for needed
interventions are necessary.

Lorazepam and Other Benzodiazepines

Lorazepam is often used in the acute treatment of neonatal seizures;
it is distributed to the brain very quickly and exerts its anticonvulsant
effect in less than 5 minutes. It is not very lipophilic and does not clear
out from the brain very rapidly. Its action can last 6-­24 hours. Usually,
it does not cause hypotension or respiratory depression. The dose is
0.1 mg/kg when used for acute treatment of seizures, and 0.05 mg/kg
(range: 0.02-­0.10 mg/kg) every 4-­8 hours when used as a scheduled
medication. Diazepam has also been used, and midazolam is often
started as a continuous infusion for refractory cases of neonatal seizures. Midazolam doses used have been in the range of 0.05-­0.15 mg/
kg as an initial intravenous bolus, with a continuous infusion of 0.5-­1
μg/kg/min intravenously that can then be gradually titrated upward, if
tolerated, every 5 minutes or longer, to a maximum of approximately
33 μg/kg/min (2 mg/kg/hr).

Phenobarbital

Consensus guidelines and existing data support the use of phenobarbital as the first-choice treatment of neonatal seizures. The usual loading
dose is 20 mg/kg. If this dosage is not effective, then additional doses
of 10-20 mg/kg can be given until a cumulative dose of 40 mg/kg is
reached. Respiratory support may be needed after phenobarbital loading. Twenty-­four hours after starting the loading dose, maintenance
dosing can be started at 3-­6 mg/kg/day, usually administered in two
separate doses. Phenobarbital is metabolized in the liver and is excreted
through the kidneys. Thus any abnormality in the function of these
organs alters the drug’s metabolism and can result in toxicity. In infants
with acidosis or critical illness that might alter the serum protein content, free (i.e., not protein bound) levels of the drug should be followed
carefully. The use of phenobarbital can be associated with electroclinical
dissociation, where electrographic seizures persist despite the resolution of clinical seizures, after the drug is given. Subsequent EEG monitoring is therefore imperative to rule out subclinical seizure activity.

Phenytoin and Fosphenytoin

Consensus guidelines support the use of fosphenytoin as a second
line anti-seizure medication in neonatal seizures. The only randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of phenobarbital versus
phenytoin did not find that one drug was superior to the other for the
treatment of neonatal seizures. Because of its reduced solubility, potentially severe local cutaneous reactions, interactions with other drugs,
and possible cardiac toxicity, intravenous phenytoin is not widely used,
and fosphenytoin is the preferred agent. Phenytoin is given at a loading dose of 20 mg/kg at a rate not to exceed 0.5-­1.0 mg/kg/min, so as
to prevent cardiac problems; the medication should be used with caution or avoided in patients with significant heart disease. The heart rate
should be monitored while the drug is administered. It is not possible
to mix phenytoin or fosphenytoin with dextrose solutions. Additionally, phenytoin and fosphenytoin should not be used in conjunction
with intravenous lidocaine owing to the concern that both drugs can
increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and hypotension.
As stated earlier, fosphenytoin, which is a phosphate ester prodrug, is preferable to phenytoin. It is highly soluble in water and can
be administered safely intravenously and intramuscularly, without
causing injury to tissues. Fosphenytoin is administered in phenytoin
equivalents (PE). The usual loading dose of fosphenytoin is 15-­20 PE/
kg administered over 30 minutes. Maintenance doses of 4-­8 PE/kg/day
can be given. As is the case for phenobarbital, free levels of the drug
should be monitored in neonates whose serum pH or protein content
might not be normal.

Other Medications

Approximately 45% of neonates respond to the first drug used if it is
phenobarbital or phenytoin, and an additional 15% respond to the

second agent. Levetiracetam (which can be given intravenously with
a later convenient conversion to oral solution) is commonly used as a
second-­or third-­line agent. In a randomized controlled trial of levetiracetam (40-­60 mg/kg) versus phenobarbital (20-­40 mg/kg) for neonatal seizures, 28% of infants responded to levetiracetam as a first-­line
agent, as compared with 80% of infants who received phenobarbital. The
maintenance dosages used are 40-­60 mg/kg/day of levetiracetam, dosed
3 times daily. Topiramate, a possible third line agent, can be given at a
dose of 5-­10 mg/kg/day (sometimes higher). There is growing evidence
that lidocaine is an effective second-­or third-­line agent, and some studies suggest it may be superior to benzodiazepines in treating neonatal
seizures. A bolus dose of 2 mg/kg is given, followed by an infusion at
a rate of 4-­6 mg/kg/hr. Cardiac arrhythmias and hypotension were not
reported at this dosing range but are potential side effects at higher
doses. Lidocaine should not be used in conjunction with phenytoin or
fosphenytoin owing to concern for cardiac side effects. A randomized
controlled trial suggested that bumetanide provided added reduction
in seizure burden when used as an adjunct agent without an increased
risk of adverse events. Studies of the efficacy and safety of lacosamide for
neonatal seizures are ongoing. Primidone, carbamazepine, lamotrigine,
or valproate use, although reported in some studies, is rarely warranted.
Valproate, for example, is more likely to be toxic in children younger
than 2 years of age than in older children.

Duration of Therapy

The duration of therapy is related to the risk of epilepsy developing
later in infants suffering from neonatal seizures, a risk that ranges from
10% to 30% and depends on the individual neurologic examination
and the etiology of the seizures. Existing data and consensus guidelines
support the discontinuation of anticonvulsant medications before hospital discharge in neonates with acute symptomatic seizures.

ADDRESSING FAMILY NEEDS

Over half of parents of newborns with seizures experience symptoms
of anxiety, one third experience symptoms of depression. Existing data
suggest that parents of newborns with seizures experience consistent
challenges, including prognostic uncertainty, concern about adapting
their family life, and the physical and emotional toll of caring for a
critically ill infant. Clinicians can help address these needs by attending
to parent psychosocial needs, connecting parents to peer support, and
communicating effectively.

633.8 Status Epilepticus
Mohamad A. Mikati and Dmitry Tchapyjnikov
Status epilepticus (SE) is a medical emergency that should be anticipated in any patient who presents with an acute seizure. The ILAE has
refined the definition of SE to reflect the time at which treatment should
be initiated (t1) and time at which continuous seizure activity leads to
long-­term sequelae (t2) such as neuronal injury, depending on the type
of SE. For generalized tonic-­clonic seizures, SE is defined as continuous
convulsive activity or recurrent generalized convulsive seizure activity without regaining consciousness (t1 = 5 minutes, t2 ≥30 minutes).
The definition differs for SE consisting of focal seizures with impaired
awareness (t1 = 10 minutes, t2 = 30 minutes) and absence SE (t1 = 10-­15
minutes, t2 = unknown). The most common type of SE is convulsive
status epilepticus (generalized tonic, clonic, or tonic-­clonic), but other
types do occur, including nonconvulsive status (focal with impaired
awareness, absence), myoclonic status, epilepsia partialis continua, and
neonatal SE. The incidence of SE ranges between 10 and 60 per 100,000
population in various studies. SE is most common in children younger
than 5 years of age, with an incidence in this age-­group of ∼100 per
100,000 children.
Approximately 30% of patients presenting with SE are having their
first seizure, and approximately 40% of these later develop epilepsy.

Febrile status epilepticus is the most common type of SE in children.
Currently, with the recognition of SE as a medical emergency, the
mortality rate is 4–5%, most of it secondary to the underlying etiology
rather than to the seizures. SE carries an approximately 14% risk of new

neurologic deficits, most of them (12.5%) secondary to the underlying
pathology.
Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) can manifest as a confusional state, dementia, fluctuating mental status, hallucinations, paranoia, aggressiveness, catatonia, and/or psychotic symptoms. It should
be considered in all children who present to the hospital in an encephalopathic state or in the intensive care unit when a child’s mental status
fails to improve. Epilepsia partialis continua has been defined previously and can be caused by tumor, vascular etiologies, mitochondrial
disease (MELAS), and Rasmussen encephalitis.
Refractory status epilepticus is SE in which a child’s seizures fail
to resolve despite therapy with both a benzodiazepine and a non-­
benzodiazepine medication. Superrefractory status epilepticus is SE that
has failed to resolve, or recurs, within 24 hours or more despite therapy that
includes a continuous infusion such as midazolam and/or pentobarbital.
New-­onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) is defined as
SE without a clear etiology after initial investigations (typically brain
imaging as well as blood and CSF analysis) have ruled out common
causes for SE, including stroke, infection, and toxic/metabolic derangements. Children presenting with NORSE may sometimes have a prodromal flulike illness before developing seizures but are otherwise
often previously healthy with no history of seizures. A clear etiology is
ultimately determined only 50% of the time and includes inflammatory
and autoimmune causes (such as anti–NMDA receptor encephalitis),
rare infectious disorders, or genetic causes that predispose the child to
having prolonged seizures (such as pathogenic variants in PCDH19).
Children with NORSE almost always develop superrefractory status
epilepticus, and the prognosis is often poor with >10% mortality and
up to two thirds developing long-­term neurologic disability. Febrile
infection-­related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) is a subtype of NORSE
in which the child also has a febrile illness 1-­14 days preceding seizure
onset (Table 633.22 and Fig. 633.13). A fever does not have to be present at the time of seizure onset as long as a fever was present in the preceding period. FIRES was thought to be a condition mostly affecting
children; however, it is recognized that NORSE and FIRES can occur
in both adults and children. An international group of pediatric epileptologists, pediatric neurointensivists, rheumatologists, and basic scientists with interest and expertise in FIRES published recommendations
regarding the approach to and management of FIRES (Figs. 633.14 and
633.15). FIRES should be considered in all previously healthy patients
older than 2 years of age who present with sudden-­onset refractory
SE within 2 weeks of a prior febrile illness (see Table 633.22). They
also recommended early use of the ketogenic diet and the IL-­1 receptor

ETIOLOGY

Etiologies of SE include new-­onset epilepsy of any type; drug intoxication (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) in children and drug and alcohol
misuse in adolescents; drug withdrawal or overdose in patients taking
AEDs; hypoglycemia; hypocalcemia; hyponatremia; hypomagnesemia;
acute head trauma; encephalitis; meningitis; autoimmune encephalitis
(anti–NMDA receptor; steroid-­responsive encephalopathy associated
with autoimmune thyroiditis [SREAT], and anti–voltage-­gated potassium channel complex antibody syndromes); ischemic (arterial or
venous) stroke; intracranial hemorrhage; folinic acid and pyridoxine-­
and pyridoxal-­phosphate dependency (these usually present in infancy,
but childhood onset is also possible); inborn errors of metabolism (see
Chapter 633.2) such as nonketotic hyperglycinemia in neonates and
MELAS in infants, children, and adolescents; ion channel–related epilepsies (e.g., sodium and potassium channel mutations reviewed in the
sections earlier); hypoxic-­ischemic injury (e.g., after cardiac arrest);
systemic conditions (such as hypertensive encephalopathy, posterior
reversible encephalopathy, renal or hepatic encephalopathy); brain

tumors; and any other disorder that can cause epilepsy (such as brain
malformations, neurodegenerative disorders, different types of progressive myoclonic epilepsy, and storage diseases).
A rare condition called hemiconvulsion-­hemiplegia-­epilepsy
syndrome consists of prolonged febrile SE presumably caused by
focal acute encephalitis with resultant atrophy in the involved hemisphere, contralateral hemiplegia, and chronic epilepsy. It should be
suspected early on to attempt to control the seizures as early as possible. This and the somewhat similar condition FIRES are likely to have
a parainfectious-­autoimmune etiology. In addition, hemophagocytic
lymphocytic histiocytosis has been reported to cause FIRES. Rasmussen encephalitis often causes epilepsia partialis continua (see
Chapter 633.3) and sometimes convulsive SE. Several types of infections are more likely to cause encephalitis with SE, such as herpes
simplex (complex partial and convulsive status), Bartonella (particularly nonconvulsive status), Epstein-­Barr virus, and mycoplasma
(postinfectious encephalomyelitis with any type of status epilepticus).
Postinfectious encephalitis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis are common causes of SE, including refractory SE. HHV-­6 can
cause a distinct epileptic syndrome with limbic SE in immunosuppressed patients.

including glucose, sodium, calcium, magnesium, complete blood count,
basic metabolic panel, CT scan, and continuous EEG, are needed for all
patients. Blood and spinal fluid cultures, toxic drug screens, and tests
for inborn errors of metabolism are often needed. AED levels need to
be determined in all patients known already to be taking these drugs.
EEG is helpful in ruling out pseudo–status epilepticus (psychologic
functional neurologic disorder mimicking SE) or other movement disorders (chorea, tics), rigors, clonus with stimulation, and decerebrate/
decorticate posturing. The EEG can also be helpful in identifying the
type of SE (generalized vs focal), which can guide further testing for the
underlying etiology and further therapy. EEG can also help distinguish
between postictal depression and later stages of SE in which the clinical
manifestations are subtle (e.g., minimal myoclonic jerks) or absent (electroclinical dissociation) and can help in monitoring the therapy, particularly in patients who are paralyzed and intubated. Neuroimaging must be
considered after the child has been stabilized, especially if it is indicated
by the clinical manifestations, by an asymmetric or focal nature of the
EEG abnormalities, or by lack of knowledge of the underlying etiology.
The initial emergent therapy should be started for convulsive seizures lasting longer than 5 minutes and involves the use of a benzodiazepine medication (Fig. 633.16). The American Epilepsy Society SE

MECHANISMS

The mechanisms leading to the establishment of sustained seizure
activity seen in SE appear to involve (1) failure of desensitization of
AMPA glutamate receptors, thus causing the persistence of increased
excitability, and (2) reduction of GABA-­mediated inhibition as a result
of intracellular internalization of GABAA receptors. This explains the
clinical observation that SE is often less likely to stop in the next specific period the longer the seizure has lasted and why benzodiazepines
appear to be decreasingly effective the longer seizure activity lasts.
During SE, there is an increased cerebral metabolic rate and a compensatory increase in cerebral blood flow that, after approximately 30
minutes, is not able to keep up with the increases in cerebral metabolic
rate. This leads to a transition from adequate to inadequate cerebral
oxygen tensions and, together with other factors, contributes to neuronal injury resulting from SE.

THERAPY

SE is a medical emergency that requires initial and continuous attention
to securing the airway, breathing, and circulation (with continuous monitoring of vital signs including ECG) and determination and management of the underlying etiology (e.g., hypoglycemia). Laboratory studies,

PE, Phenytoin sodium equivalents.

Guidelines recommend using either intravenous lorazepam, intravenous diazepam, or intramuscular midazolam as a first-­line agent. The
Neurocritical Care Society SE Guidelines recommend intravenous
lorazepam as a first-­line agent and, if the patient does not have intravenous access, using intramuscular midazolam. Table 633.23 outlines
the drugs and dosages typically used in SE. If intravenous access is not
available, other options besides intramuscular midazolam include buccal or intranasal midazolam, intranasal lorazepam, or rectal diazepam.
With all options, respiratory depression is a potential side effect for
which the patient should be monitored and managed as needed. If seizures persist 5 minutes after the initial benzodiazepine dose, a second
dose of the drug should be given. Less evidence supports the use of
phenytoin/fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, valproate, or levetiracetam
as alternative first-­line agents. Additionally, in some infants, a trial of
pyridoxine may be warranted.
If the emergency therapy with a benzodiazepine is unsuccessful (persistent seizures 5 minutes after the second benzodiazepine
dose), fosphenytoin, valproate, or levetiracetam is the recommended option for urgent therapy. Fosphenytoin is given at a loading dose of 20 mg/kg, and a level is usually taken 2 hours later to
ensure achievement of a therapeutic concentration. Depending on
the level and response, a maintenance dose can be started right
away or, more commonly, 6 hours after the initial bolus. Valproate

is given at a loading dose of 40 mg/kg, but its use should be avoided
in patients younger than 2 years of age and in those with hepatic
dysfunction or mitochondrial disease. Levetiracetam is given at
loading doses of 60 mg/kg and is well tolerated. Several prospective
studies have compared the efficacy of these second-­line agents in
treating SE that failed to respond to benzodiazepines. One demonstrated the noninferiority of levetiracetam, fosphenytoin, and
valproate. Others demonstrated the noninferiority of levetiracetam
to phenytoin. In all of these studies, roughly half the patients have
seizure resolution with a second-­line agent.
Intravenous phenobarbital is an alternative option if valproate, fosphenytoin, or levetiracetam is not available but is not recommended as
a first-­line urgent therapy because of its side effects. The phenobarbital
dose used in neonates is usually 20 mg/kg as a loading dose, but in
infants and children the dose is often lower to avoid respiratory depression, with the dose repeated if there is not an adequate response. If
seizures persist after administration of the urgent therapy medication,
a decision must be made regarding redosing with another second-­line
agent or proceeding to a continuous infusion. This decision is case-­
dependent. The Neurocritical Care Society Guidelines on SE suggest
that definitive seizure control should be achieved within 60 minutes
of seizure onset, which may prompt opting for the more aggressive
therapy (i.e., proceeding to continuous infusion and intubation) in a

Chapter 633 u Seizures in Childhood 3629
patient who has already had convulsive seizures for more than 30-­60
minutes.
After the second or third medication is given, and sometimes before
that, the patient might need to be intubated. All patients with SE, even
the ones who respond, need to be admitted to the intensive care unit for
completion of therapy and monitoring. Ideally, emergent and urgent
therapies should have been received within less than 30 minutes so as
to initiate the subsequent therapy soon, thus reducing the chances of
sequelae. For refractory status epilepticus treatment, an intravenous
bolus followed by continuous infusion of midazolam, propofol, pentobarbital, or thiopental is used. Subsequent boluses and adjustment
of the rate of the infusion are usually made, depending on clinical and
EEG responses. Because most of these patients need to be intubated
and paralyzed, the EEG becomes the method of choice by which to
monitor response to therapy. The goal is to stop electrographic seizure
activity before reducing the therapy. Usually this implies achievement
of complete flattening of the EEG, a pattern called burst suppression. Some consider that achieving a burst suppression pattern may
be enough, and the periods of flattening in such a case need to be 8-­20
seconds to ensure interruption of electrographic seizure activity. Evidence suggests that patients who receive higher doses of intravenous
anesthetic therapy earlier and achieve EEG voltage suppression sooner
are more likely to have fewer complications and shorter duration for
need for mechanical ventilation.
Patients receiving these therapies require careful attention to blood
pressure and to systemic complications, and some develop multiorgan
failure. It is not unusual for patients put into pentobarbital coma to
have to be given multiple vasopressors to maintain their blood pressure
during therapy.
The choice among these options to treat refractory and superrefractory SE often depends on the experience of the specific center.
Midazolam probably has fewer side effects but is less effective, and
barbiturate coma is more effective but carries a higher risk of side
effects. Some patients taking propofol develop propofol infusion
syndrome with lactic acidosis, hemodynamic instability, and rhabdomyolysis with higher infusion rates (>67 μg/kg/min). This limits
the use of propofol in the pediatric population. Electrolytes, creatine
phosphokinase, and organ function studies need to be monitored
if a patient is being given propofol infusion therapy. Often, barbiturate coma and similar therapies are maintained for one or more
days before it is possible to gradually taper the therapy, usually over
a few days. However, in some cases, including cases of NORSE, such
therapies need to be maintained for several weeks or even months.
Even though the prognosis in NORSE (and FIRES) cases is often poor
and many patients do not survive, meaningful recovery despite a prolonged course is still possible.
Patients with superrefractory status epilepticus (SRSE) have persistent seizure activity or seizure recurrence despite 24 hours of general
anesthesia with medications such as midazolam, pentobarbital, and/or
propofol. In addition to these continuous infusions, polytherapy with
other AEDs is usually initiated, although data are lacking regarding
the optimal treatment strategy. The most commonly used drugs are
fosphenytoin, valproate, phenobarbital, levetiracetam, topiramate, and
lacosamide.
Ketamine infusion is a recognized treatment option for SRSE. It is an
NMDA receptor antagonist and may be of particular benefit because
NMDA receptors are upregulated in SE. The ketogenic diet has also been
found to be effective in children, although the response may take up to a
week after diet initiation and ketosis may be more difficult to achieve if
the patient is receiving pentobarbital, which has a carbohydrate-­rich carrier fluid. Immunotherapy with intravenous steroids, immunoglobulins,
and/or plasma exchange is often used in cases of SRSE of unclear etiology. In specific situations such as anti–NMDA receptor encephalitis or
CNS vasculitis, immunotherapy may be the first-­line therapy. Because
it can take some time to definitively diagnose autoimmune encephalitides, immunotherapy is often initiated empirically if the clinical history
is consistent with the diagnosis. Inhaled anesthetics such as isoflurane
have been used for SRSE but are associated with a number of adverse
reactions and require the presence of an anesthesiologist at bedside,

which limits their use. Induced hypothermia has also been used, but
further studies are needed to assess its safety and efficacy. In select cases
of lesional SRSE, emergent neurosurgery may be an option. Such cases
include performing hemispherectomy for Rasmussen encephalitis or
focal resection if the seizures are secondary to an area of cortical dysplasia. The use of VNS, electroconvulsive therapy, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (for epilepsia partialis continua) has also been reported.
Allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid, has shown promise in the treatment
of pediatric and adult SRSE, and clinical trials are currently underway to
better determine its efficacy.
For nonconvulsive status epilepticus and epilepsia partialis continua, therapy needs to be tailored according to the clinical manifestations
and often consists of trials of sequential oral or sometimes parenteral
AEDs without resorting to barbiturate coma or overmedication that
could result in respiratory compromise. The approach to focal SE with
impaired awareness is sometimes similar to the approach to generalized
convulsive SE and sometimes intermediate between the approach for
epilepsia partialis and that for convulsive status, depending on severity.

633.9 Reflex Seizures (Stimulus-­Precipitated
Seizures)
Mohamad A. Mikati, Dmitry Tchapyjnikov, and
Kevin M. Rathke
Many patients with epilepsy can identify precipitating or provoking
events that predispose them to having a seizure. Common precipitants
in these patients include stress, lack of sleep, fever, or fatigue.
However, there is another group of patients who have seizures in
response to a specifically identifiable sensory stimulus or activity and
are considered to have reflex seizures. Because no known reflex may
be involved, more appropriate terms may be sensory-­precipitated or
stimulus-­sensitive seizures. Stimuli may be external (light, patterns,
music, brushing teeth) or internal (math, reading, thinking, self-­
induced). Reflex seizures may be generalized, focal, nonconvulsive,
absence, or myoclonic. One pattern is photosensitive seizures in which
repetitive photic stimulation induces photoparoxysmal epileptogenic
discharges on EEG and sometimes seizures.
Photosensitive seizures are a well-­recognized disorder stimulated by
bright or flashing lights (TV, video games, discotheques, concert light
shows) or by patterns (TV, video games, lines on the road while traveling). Visual sensitivity may occur in 0.3–3% of the population, whereas
photosensitive or pattern-­induced seizures may occur in 1 in 4,000
people in the at-­risk age-­group of 5-­25 years. When Japanese children
were exposed to a Pokémon cartoon that induced seizures in many, only
24% of those had a history of prior spontaneous seizures. Some children
with photosensitive epilepsies stimulate seizures purposefully by rapidly
blinking or waving a hand in front of their face (sunflower syndrome).
Patients tend to outgrow photosensitive or pattern-­induced seizures in
their 30s. Photoparoxysmal responses, with an abnormal EEG response
to photic stimulation, are more common than photic-­induced seizures.
For patients with isolated photosensitive or pattern-­induced seizures, avoidance or modification of stimuli is the initial approach. Such
activities may include wearing blue or polarized sunglasses, avoiding high-­contrast flashing-­light video games, avoiding discotheques,
watching television in a well-­lit room at a distance of >8 feet, and covering one eye when in a provocative situation. A number of genes have
been associated with certain patients with reflex epilepsy such as CHD2
with photosensitive or self-­induced seizures caused by fixation-­off sensitivity, LGI1 or SCN1A with musicogenic seizures, MECP2 with eating
seizures in Rett syndrome, and SYN1, GPR56, or SYNGAP1 with hot
water or bathing epilepsy. Not all patients with these reflex seizures
have these pathogenic variants, nor do all patients with variants in
these genes have reflex seizures.

3630 Part XXV u The Nervous System

633.10 Nodding Syndrome
Michael J. Boivin and Itziar Familiar-­Lopez
Nodding syndrome (NS) is form of epilepsy that mainly affects children
between 3 and 18 years of age who live in distinct regions of Uganda,
Liberia, Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and southern
Sudan. The prevalence is approximately 6.8 per 1,000 children. The first
clinical symptom is usually an involuntary nodding of the head in a
previously healthy child. These nodding episodes are characterized by
at least daily rapid, paroxysmal, forward head-­bobbing spells lasting
several minutes; some patients are unresponsive, whereas others may
respond to commands or continue what they were doing before the
episode. Nodding episodes may be triggered during meals while eating
hot foods or drinking cold liquids; cold environmental temperatures
may also trigger a nodding episode. Head nodding has been determined to be a type of atonic seizure, although other types of seizures,
including generalized tonic-­clonic or absence seizures, may develop.
Given the extent of the brain pathogenesis in NS, it is not surprising
that it is accompanied by lifelong profound cognitive neurodisability,
severe behavior and psychiatric difficulties, growth stunting, delayed
puberty, and high mortality rates (Table 633.24 lists case definitions).
Although the diagnosis remains largely based on clinical presentation, the EEG demonstrates a disorganized slow background and interictal generalized 2.5-­to 3.0-­Hz spike–and–slow waves, with generalized
electrodecrement and paraspinal electromyography dropout suggestive of an atonic seizure. NS is characterized by stunted brain growth,
which includes significant brain atrophy near the hippocampal and
glial matter of the brain and significant cerebellar involvement. Routine CSF analyses are usually negative, but brain MRI shows cerebral
and cerebellar atrophy. An MRI study of Tanzanian nodding disease
patients revealed that the most frequent abnormality was generalized
atrophy, followed by intraparenchymal pathologies such as changes in
the hippocampus, gliotic lesions, and subcortical signal abnormalities.
Treatment of seizures is indicated, and choice of AED should be
based on the type of seizure presented. Sodium valproate is indicated
for atonic seizures and may be a good option to simultaneously treat
behavioral difficulties like aggression and impulsive behavior. The
suggested starting dose is 10 mg/kg/day in two divided doses and
increase the dose by 5 mg/kg/day until seizure control is achieved or

the maximum dose is reached (40 mg/kg/day). Other antiepileptic
medications used for NS include phenytoin and phenobarbitone, either
individually or combined. Management of behavioral and psychiatric
difficulties, nursing care, nutritional, and subsequently, physical and
cognitive rehabilitation should also be considered.
Despite extensive investigations, the etiology of NS remains
unknown. A systematic review using the Bradford Hill criteria for causality identified Onchocerca volvulus as the most likely trigger of NS
and other forms of onchocerciasis-­associated epilepsy. O. volvulus is a
nematode carried by the blackfly, the bites of which can cause onchocerciasis, a highly prevalent type of blindness caused by infection.
High prevalence of NS overlaps with onchocerciasis-­endemic areas
with high rates of O. volvulus transmission and low or no coverage of
community-­directed treatment with ivermectin. However, the pathophysiologic mechanism through which O. volvulus could directly cause
the neurologic damage observed in NS patients remains unknown, as
microfilariae are not known to invade the brain.
Studies in Uganda support the hypothesis that NS may be an autoimmune epileptic disorder caused by molecular mimicry with O. volvulus
antigens. Histologic postmortem examination of brains has revealed polarizable material in the majority of specimens, but it has proved difficult to
characterize or identify. There is evidence of autoantibodies to leiomodin­1 in both the sera and CSF of Ugandan patients with nodding syndrome.
Because leiomodin-­1 antibodies cross react with O. volvulus proteins, nodding syndrome may be an autoimmune epilepsy initiated by the infection
caused by this parasite. Therefore it may be preventable by treatment with
antiparasitic strategies, such as the drug ivermectin. It may also perhaps be
treatable in its early stages with immunomodulatory therapies.
Onchocerciasis tends to have the highest prevalence in rural east and
central African areas with poorly developed healthcare and social service
infrastructures. Because of this, families with children affected by nodding disease, often existing on the margins of their resources in impoverished areas, have little in the way of caregiving resources needed to cope
with the profound disability that results from this disease. This further
diminishes the prognosis for these children because of further risk to
their health from accidental injury (e.g., burns from cooking fires), malnutrition because of difficulty in feeding, and/or neglect.

Conditions That Mimic
Seizures
Mohamad A. Mikati and Makram M. Obeid
The misdiagnosis of epilepsy is estimated to be as high as 5–40%. Often
all that is needed to differentiate nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders
from epilepsy is a careful and detailed history in addition to a thorough
clinical examination, but sometimes an electroencephalogram (EEG)
or more advanced testing may be necessary. The ready availability of
video recording on mobile phones can provide invaluable information. Nonepileptic paroxysmal disorders can be classified according
to the age at presentation and the clinical manifestations: (1) syncope
and other generalized paroxysms, (2) movement disorders and other
paroxysmal movements and postures, (3) oculomotor and visual
abnormalities and visual hallucinations, and (4) sleep-­related disorders
(Table 634.1 and Fig. 634.1).

SYNCOPE AND OTHER GENERALIZED PAROXYSMS
Apnea

Apneic episodes (cessation of breathing >20 seconds) in neonates and
apnea caused by brainstem compression are usually associated with

3631

bradycardia. In contrast, apnea associated with seizures is usually
accompanied by tachycardia. Exceptions are seen because bradycardia
can occur during some epileptic seizures, and severe apnea of any cause
can be followed by anoxic seizures. The term brief resolved unexplained
event (BRUE) is defined as an event in an infant reported as a sudden,
brief, self-­resolving episode consisting of one or more of the following:
(1) cyanosis or pallor; (2) absent, decreased, or irregular breathing; (3)
a marked change in tone (hyper-­or hypotonia); and (4) an altered level
of responsiveness (see Chapter 424). A BRUE, which usually lasts less
than 1 minute, is diagnosed only when no explanation is evident after
an appropriate history and physical examination have been conducted.
Apnea can either be obstructive or central, most commonly in premature
neonates. Central apnea also occurs in the context of certain neurogenetic syndromes, the prototype of which is congenital central hypoventilation syndrome secondary to pathogenic variants in PHOX2B. Ondine’s
curse (idiopathic congenital central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome)
consists of an inadequate respiratory drive in sleep with periods of prolonged apnea requiring tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation (see
Chapter 468.2). Apnea can also be secondary to near cerebral herniation and intermittent brainstem compression in the context of increased
intracranial pressure or Chiari malformations.

Breath-­Holding Spells

The term breath-­holding spells is actually a misnomer, because they are not
necessarily self-­induced but result from the immaturity of the autonomic
system and occur in two different forms. The first type is the pallid breath-­
holding spell, which is caused by reflex vagal-­cardiac bradycardia and asystole. The second type is the cyanotic, or blue, breath-­holding spell, which
does not occur during inspiration but results from prolonged expiratory

apnea and intrapulmonary shunting (see Chapter 43). Episodes usually start
with a cry (often, in the case of the pallid type, a silent cry with marked pallor) and progress to apnea and cyanosis. Spells usually begin between 6 and
18 months of age. Syncope, tonic posturing, and even reflex anoxic seizures
may follow the more severe episodes, particularly in breath-­holding spells of
the pallid type. Injury (such as even a minor bump on the head), pain, and
frustration, particularly with surprise, are common triggers. There usually
is a family history of vasovagal syncope or breath-­holding spells. Education
and reassurance of the parents are usually all that is needed because these
episodes are, as a rule, self-­limited and are outgrown within a few years.
However, screening for anemia and for electrical cardiac disturbances with
an electrocardiogram is recommended because the spells are worsened by
iron-­deficiency anemia and can rarely be the presenting sign of long QT
(LQT) syndromes. Anticholinergic drugs, for the selected cases of pallid
breath-holding spells (e.g., atropine sulfate 0.03 mg/kg/day in two to three
divided doses with a maximum daily dose of 1.2 mg) or antiseizure drug
therapy for coexisting anoxic seizures that are recurrent, prolonged, and not
responding to other measures may rarely be needed. If antiseizure medications are needed, it is ill-­advised to use medications that may increase irritability, such as levetiracetam. It is important also to educate parents on how
to handle more severe spells with first aid measures or even basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation when needed. Extremely severe episodes resulting in
marked bradycardia and asystole have been reported to respond to a cardiac
pacemaker. All parents should be taught not to provide secondary gain when
the episodes occur, because this can reinforce them. Also, preparation for
unpleasant experiences (such as receiving a shot) rather than surprising the
child with them can help limit the number of spells.

Compulsive Valsalva-­Like Maneuver

In children with intellectual disability, including Rett syndrome, syncopal convulsions may be self-­induced by maneuvers such as the Valsalva maneuver. In this case, true breath holding occurs, and it usually
lasts for approximately 10 seconds during inspiration. Some clinicians
advocate the use of naloxone in such cases. In the authors’ experience,
a compulsive Valsalva-­like maneuver can rarely be a feature of a panic
attack or conversion disorder. When clinically stereotyped, a prolonged
EEG and a careful workup by a pediatric epileptologist are needed in
order to rule out epileptic seizures.

Neurally Mediated Syncope

Syncope can present with drop attacks and can also lead to generalized
convulsions, termed anoxic seizures. These convulsions, triggered by a
sudden reduction of oxygen to the brain, are clinically similar to, and can

be misdiagnosed as, generalized epileptic seizures. Vasovagal (neurocardiogenic) syncope is usually triggered by dehydration, heat, standing for a long time without movement, hot showers, the sight of blood,
pain, swallowing, vomiting, sudden exposure to cold as with cold water
immersion, and a sudden episode of stress (see Chapter 84). The history is usually the clue to distinguishing syncope from epileptic seizures:
there is initially pallor and sweating followed by blurring of vision, dizziness, and nausea and then a gradual collapse with loss of consciousness.
Of importance is the fact that such prodromal features have an insidious
onset and build up gradually, often arising from a state of malaise when
they precede syncope. However, in epilepsy, when auras with similar features precede an epileptic seizure, such features are usually sudden, short
in duration, and followed by other manifestations of complex partial
seizures such as stereotyped automatisms. Abdominal pain, a common
aura in temporal lobe epilepsy, occurs in vasovagal syncope and can be
a trigger or a consequence of that process (intestinal vagal hyperactivity). Urinary incontinence and a brief period of convulsive jerks are not
uncommon in vasovagal syncope. These occur with a frequency of 10%
and 50%, respectively. Postictal confusion only rarely occurs, and the
rule is the occurrence of only brief postictal tiredness with a subsequent
remarkable ability to resume planned activities. Most children with vasovagal syncope have an affected first-­degree relative; reports demonstrate
autosomal dominant inheritance at least in some families. The EEG is
normal, and the tilt test has been used for diagnostic purposes in selected
cases. In most cases with a typical history, this test is not needed. In addition, exercise-­induced anaphylaxis has rarely been reported. In stretch
syncope, which occurs mostly in adolescents while stretching the neck
and the trunk backward and the arms outward or during flexion of the
neck, the presumed mechanism is mechanical disruption of brain perfusion caused by compression of the vertebral arteries. In some other
cases, this may be associated with an abnormally prolonged stylomastoid process compressing the carotids. If the latter condition is suspected,
neuroimaging with cranial CT or MRI is required for proper diagnosis of the stylomastoid anomaly. Migraine can also induce vasovagal
syncope. Other causes of syncope include primary autonomic failure,
which is rare in children, and familial dysautonomia is the only relatively
common form. Familial dysautonomia, a disease found in Ashkenazi
Jews, is characterized by absence of overflow emotional tears, depressed
patellar reflexes, and lack of a flare reaction after intradermal histamine.
Dopamine β-­hydroxylase deficiency is a rare cause of primary autonomic failure and is characterized by a complicated perinatal course
(hypotension, hypotonia, hypothermia), ptosis, highly arched palate,
hyperflexible joints, nocturia, and later impaired ejaculation.

Postural Tachycardia Syndrome
See Chapter 84.1.

Cardiac Syncope

See Chapters 84 and 485.
LQT syndromes can cause life-­
threatening pallid syncope.
Accompanying this are ventricular arrhythmias and, usually, torsades de pointes or even ventricular fibrillation. When accompanied
by congenital deafness, it is part of the autosomal recessive Jervell
and Lange-­Nielsen syndrome (type 1, LQT 1, associated with the
KvLQT1 potassium channel pathogenic variant). Romano-­Ward syndrome is an autosomal dominant syndrome with incomplete penetrance (LQT 2 associated with an HERG potassium channel variant).
LQT 3 is associated with an SCN1A sodium channel variant, LQT 4
with an ankyrin protein mutation, LQT 5 (milder form) with KCNE1
variants, LQT 6 with KCNE2 potassium channel gene variants, LQT
9 with caveolin sodium channel–related protein variants, and LQT
10 with SCN4B sodium channel variants. LQT 7 and LQT 8 have
associated clinical and neurologic manifestations. LQT 7 (Andersen-­
Tawil) syndrome is associated with periodic paralysis, skeletal developmental abnormalities, clinodactyly, low-­set ears, and micrognathia
(variants in KCNJ2). LQT 8, or Timothy syndrome (variants in the
calcium channel gene CACNA1C), manifests with congenital heart
disease, autism, syndactyly, and immune deficiency. All family members of an affected child should be investigated. Affected individuals

need insertion of cardiac defibrillators, and their families should be
taught cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Children with a new-­onset
seizure disorder of unclear etiology should get an electrocardiogram to rule out LQT syndrome masquerading as a seizure disorder.
Cardiac syncope is usually sudden, without the gradual onset and
symptoms that accompany vagal syncope. Aortic stenosis can cause
sudden syncope at the height of exercise (usually hypertrophic) or
directly at the end (usually valvular) and, if suspected, warrants an
echocardiogram.

Migraine and Migraine Variants

Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) is a rare type of autosomal
dominant migraine with the prominent feature of transient motor
weakness. Attacks begin as early as 5-­7 years of age. In a genetically
susceptible child, attacks may be precipitated by head trauma, exertion, or emotional stress. The three genes commonly identified are
CACNA1A in FHM1 (neuronal calcium channel subunit), ATP1A2
in FHM2 (sodium potassium adenosine triphosphatase subunit), and
SCN1A in FHM3 (neuronal sodium channel subunit). Pathogenic variants of other genes such as PRRT2 may also cause FHM. However, at
least a quarter of the affected families and most of the sporadic patients
do not carry a pathogenic variant in these genes. Headaches occur
in all attacks in most patients. The presence of negative phenomena
(e.g., numbness, visual scotomas) in addition to positive phenomena
(pins and needles, flickering lights) and the progressive and successive
occurrence of visual, sensory, motor, aphasic, and basilar signs and
symptoms, in that order, help differentiate these attacks from epileptic
seizures. Persistent cerebellar deficits (e.g., nystagmus, ataxia) may be
present. Verapamil, acetazolamide, and lamotrigine have been successfully used to prevent attacks, and verapamil and ketamine have been
used for the acute episode; ergot derivatives, nimodipine, Midrin (isometheptene mucate, dichloralphenazone, and paracetamol), and probably triptans and propranolol are to be avoided because of concerns of
exacerbating the attacks. Interestingly, the co-­occurrence of epileptic
seizures has been reported in a minority of patients with hemiplegic
migraine. It is important also to note that recurrent attacks akin to
hemiplegic migraine can be symptomatic of Sturge-­Weber syndrome
or various metabolic diseases (e.g., mitochondrial encephalopathy with
lactic acidosis and strokelike episodes, as well as alternating hemiplegia
of childhood).
Benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood is a common migraine
equivalent that consists of brief seconds-­to-­minutes episodes of vertigo that are often accompanied by postural imbalance and nystagmus. It is important to note that vertigo does not always refer to a
spinning motion; it can also refer to a backward or forward motion
(vertigo titubans) where children sometimes report that objects
seem to be moving toward them. The child appears frightened during the episode. Diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, and, rarely, tinnitus
may be present. Episodes usually remit by 6 years of age. MRIs and
EEGs are normal, but caloric testing, if done, can show abnormal
vestibular function. Diphenhydramine 5 mg/kg/day (maximum of
300 mg/day) may be used for a cluster of attacks. Preventive therapy
with cyproheptadine may rarely be needed for frequent attacks.
Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is another related periodic
migraine variant that can respond to antimigraine or antiepileptic
drugs. Recurrent vomiting can also be caused by neuromyelitis optica,
juvenile Alexander disease, brainstem pathology, inborn errors of
metabolism with intermittent presentations, and seizures, usually from
the nondominant temporal lobe. With the latter, there is, as a rule,
impaired consciousness. Prophylaxis for CVS has included medications such as amitriptyline, propranolol, cyproheptadine, sumatriptan,
erythromycin, coenzyme Q, fluoxetine, or antiepileptics. Acute therapy
usually consists of 10% dextrose intravenously with ondansetron and
an antihistamine or benzodiazepine.
Alice in Wonderland syndrome (see “Visual Hallucinations,” later),
confusional migraine, and abdominal migraine are also migraine variants. One should note that many patients with migraine or migraine
variants (including FHM) have coexisting epilepsy, and children with

3633

epilepsy have a higher incidence of migraine headaches compared with
the general population, so providers should be aware that such patients
may have symptoms attributable to either.

Nonepileptic Seizures (Formerly, Functional Disorders)

Nonepileptic seizures are a form of functional neurologic disorder that can be diagnosed clinically based on the characteristics of
the spells (Tables 634.2 and 634.3). A video of the event is usually
possible because most of the events are witnessed and tend to be
more prolonged than epileptic seizures. If needed, a diagnosis can
be confirmed by video-­EEG with capture of an episode to eliminate
any residual doubts about its nature because these functional paroxysms can often occur in patients who also have epileptic seizures.
A social history is very important because psychogenic nonepileptic
seizures (PNESs) are often a reaction to physical or sexual abuse or
to the inability to cope with psychosocial tasks. They are best managed acutely by reassurance about their relatively benign nature
and by a supportive attitude while at the same time avoiding positive reinforcement of the episodes; an early accurate diagnosis and
timely management result in more favorable outcomes. The use of
terms such as nonepileptic stress seizures facilitates communication
with families, given the often-­perceived negative connotation of the
term psychogenic. Psychiatric evaluation and follow-­up are needed to
uncover an underlying psychopathology and to establish continued
support because psychogenic seizures can persist over long periods.
Malingering and factitious disorder imposed on another (formerly
called Munchausen syndrome by proxy) are often difficult to diagnose,
but an approach similar to that for psychogenic seizures, including
video-­EEG monitoring, is often helpful. Sad cases of loss of consciousness related to suffocation by caregivers in infants and toddlers
have also been reported.

Paroxysmal Extreme Pain Disorder

Paroxysmal extreme pain disorder, previously called familial rectal
pain syndrome, is caused by an autosomal dominant gain-­of-­function
variant in a sodium channel (Nav1.7) encoded by the SCN9A gene.
Paroxysmal extreme pain disorder usually starts in infancy and persists throughout life. Autonomic manifestations predominate initially, with skin flushing in all cases and harlequin color change and
tonic attacks in most. Dramatic syncope with bradycardia and sometimes asystole occurs. Later, the disorder is characterized by attacks
of excruciating, deep burning pain often in the rectal, ocular, or jaw
areas, but also diffusely in some. Attacks are triggered by defecation,
cold, wind, eating, and emotion. Carbamazepine is used, but the
response is often incomplete. Neurologically impaired children can
often have irritability without clear etiology even after investigations,
and this has been reported to respond to gabapentin (for neurologic
irritability).

Autonomic Storms

Autonomic storms are also referred to as diencephalic seizures,
paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity, sympathetic storms, paroxysmal autonomic instability with dystonia, dysautonomia, and
central autonomic dysfunction. Spells of hyperhidrosis and changes
in blood pressure, temperature, and autonomic instability occur in
patients with severe diffuse brain injury or localized hypothalamic
injury and have been termed autonomic storms. The term diencephalic seizures is discouraged because the episodes are not truly
seizures. Therapy is difficult and has included, with mixed results,
clonidine, propranolol, baclofen (oral or intrathecal), benzodiazepines (particularly clonazepam), bromocriptine, chlorpromazine, hydralazine, methadone, cyproheptadine, morphine, and
sympathectomy.
Serotonin syndrome caused by antidepressants, stimulants, opioids,
certain herbs such as St. John’s wort, and some other medications can
produce similar symptoms, and if not recognized, can at times be fatal,
as can the similar neuroleptic malignant syndrome caused by antipsychotic medications.

Chapter 634 u Conditions That Mimic Seizures
MOVEMENT DISORDERS AND OTHER
PAROXYSMAL MOVEMENTS AND POSTURES
Neonatal Jitteriness and Clonus

Jitteriness consists of recurrent tremors. These movements manifest as
equal backward-­and-­forward movements of the limbs, either occurring spontaneously or triggered by touch or loud sounds. Movement
suppression by stimulus removal or by relaxing the affected limbs, the
lack of autonomic symptoms, and the clear difference from the two-­
phased (fast contraction, slow relaxation) clonic activity and the very
quick myoclonic jerks point to a nonepileptic event. Hypocalcemia,
hypoglycemia, drug withdrawal, and hypoxic-­ischemic encephalopathy are possible etiologies, but jitteriness is also often seen in normal neonates. Clonus as a result of corticospinal tract injury usually
occurs in later infancy and childhood and can be stopped by a change
in position. Two to three beats of clonus can be within normal in
some neonates.

Hyperekplexia (Stiff Baby Syndrome) and Pathologic
Startles

Hyperekplexia is a rare, sporadic, or dominantly inherited (less often
recessive or X-­linked) disorder with neonatal onset of life-­threatening
episodes of tonic stiffening that precipitate apnea and convulsive
hypoxic seizures. It is characterized by a triad of generalized stiffness,
nocturnal myoclonus, and later a pathologic startle reflex. Stiffness
may result in difficulty in swallowing, choking spells, hip dislocations, umbilical or inguinal hernias, and delayed motor development.
Stiffness in the neonatal form improves by 1 year of age and may disappear during sleep. The genetic cause is a defect in the α or β subunits of the strychnine-­sensitive glycine receptors. However, other
less common pathogenic variants that disrupt the glycine receptor
signaling complex have also been described. Pathogenic variants in
GLRA1 or SLC6A5 are the most common genes followed by GLRB,
GPHM, and ARHGEF9 (X-­linked). A specific diagnostic sign can be
elicited by tapping the nose, which produces a nonfatigable startle
reflex with head retraction. Bathing, sudden awakening, and auditory or tactile stimuli can induce attacks. The differential diagnosis
includes congenital stiff person syndrome, startle epilepsy, myoclonic
seizures, neonatal tetany, phenothiazine toxicity, and Schwartz-­
Jampel syndrome. Making a prompt diagnosis is extremely important
so that treatment with clonazepam can be initiated, because hypoxic
brain injury can result from a prolonged episode. Other antiepileptics have also been effective. Repeatedly flexing the baby at the neck
and hips (the Vigevano maneuver) can abort the episodes. Rare challenging cases of children with hyperekplexia and concomitant epileptic seizures (including myoclonic seizures) have been reported. In
other children after brain injury, and in many patients with cerebral
palsy, an exaggerated startle reflex can occur; this is more common
than hyperekplexia. In Tay-­Sachs disease and similar gangliosidoses,
an exaggerated startle to sound occurs and has been inappropriately
interpreted as hyperacusis. Hiccups can occur normally in newborns
but can be a feature of nonketotic hyperglycinemia, citrullinemia,
and neuromyelitis optica syndromes, with the latter presenting during later childhood and adolescence rather than in neonates. In addition, in children with neurologic diseases, a related limited repertoire
of movements and behaviors, startle, arousal, or signs of distress may
be clinically expressed with stereotyped movements that can mimic
epileptic seizures.

Benign Paroxysmal Torticollis of Infancy

This condition typically presents as morning episodes of painless retrocollis and, later, torticollis, often triggered by changes in
posture. Attacks may start with abnormal ocular movements and
progress to stillness in an abnormal posture. Vomiting, malaise,
irritability, and ataxia may be present during the spells that usually
last minutes (paroxysmal) or, more commonly, hours and, at times,
days (periodic). Neurologic exam between attacks, EEG, and neuroimaging studies are normal. The condition affects girls more than
boys (3:1), often begins in infancy, and spontaneously remits before

3635

the age of 5 years. However, some children, particularly those with
migrainous features during attacks, develop migraine later in life.
Indeed, this condition is considered to be a migraine equivalent
and cosegregates with migraine in families. Medical therapy is supportive during the attacks, especially when vomiting is a prominent
feature.

Sandifer Syndrome and Rumination

Gastroesophageal reflux in infants may cause paroxysmal episodes
of generalized stiffening and opisthotonic posturing that may be
accompanied by apnea, staring, and minimal jerking of the extremities. Episodes often occur 30 minutes after a feed. In older children,
this syndrome manifests with episodic dystonic or dyskinetic movements consisting of laterocollis, retrocollis, or torticollis, the exact
pathophysiology of which remains elusive. Reflux can also present
with rumination consisting of contraction of abdominal muscles
followed by mouthing and swallowing movements and at times
vomiting.

Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood

This is a rare, often severe, disorder that consists of attacks of flaccid
hemiplegia affecting one or both sides lasting minutes to days, starting in the first 18 months of life. Earlier manifestations include paroxysmal nystagmus, which is often monocular and ipsilateral to the
hemiplegia or dystonia. Dystonic spells are the rule also. Patients can
have episodes of reduced consciousness and confusion that are not
epileptic. Most affected children also have ataxia and developmental
delay, and many have choreoathetosis and behavioral problems. Most
of the patients are initially misdiagnosed as having refractory focal
epilepsy with Todd paralysis. About half of them also have epileptic seizures, which makes the differential diagnosis even more difficult. Flunarizine 2.5-­20 mg/day reduces the frequency and severity
of the attacks. This condition is most commonly caused by variants in
ATP1A3, but it can also result from variants in ATP1A2 or the glucose
transporter 1 (GLUT-­1/SLC2AI), variants that are notoriously associated with diagnostically challenging protean manifestations ranging
from epilepsy, usually in early life, to movement disorders thereafter.
The ATP1A3 gene has also been reported in a syndrome of relapsing
encephalopathy with cerebellar ataxia (RECA) during febrile illnesses. Another syndrome is benign nocturnal alternating hemiplegia, which manifests during sleep and is generally outgrown and has
been linked to PRRT2 variants.

Paroxysmal Dyskinesias and Other Movement
Disorders

These disorders are characterized by sudden attacks that consist of
choreic, dystonic, ballistic, or mixed movements (Table 633.4 and see
Table 634.3). Despite their historical classification into distinct entities, emerging insight into their clinical features and their underlying
genetic causes is revealing a significant overlap with phenotypic pleiotropy whereby a pathogenic variant in a single gene may be associated
with multiple types of dyskinesias and paroxysms, including epileptic
seizures even in the same child. A sensation of fatigue or weakness
confined to one side may herald an attack. Consciousness is preserved
and patients may be able to perform a motor activity, such as walking, despite the attack. The variability in the pattern of severity and
localization between different attacks may also help in differentiating
them from seizures. The frequency of attacks increases in adolescence
and steadily decreases in the third decade. Neurologic examination
between attacks, laboratory investigations, and imaging studies are
usually normal. Because the co-­occurrence of movement disorders
and epileptic seizures is not uncommon, the nature of each type of paroxysmal event has to be characterized as epileptic or not, often with
a cautiously analyzed video-­EEG, as movement-­related artifact may
be misread as epileptiform. Chorea consists of involuntary rapid fast
movements that are slower than myoclonus and not rhythmic. Common causes are poststreptococcal Sydenham chorea, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Action

myoclonus and paroxysmal lower body action dystonia occur in children with myoclonus dystonia—a syndrome caused by pathogenic
variants in SGCE or RELN. Drug reactions can result in abnormal
movements; they include oculogyric crisis with many antiemetics
and lamotrigine toxicity, choreoathetosis with phenytoin, dystonia and
facial dyskinesias with antidopaminergic drugs, and tics with carbamazepine. Strokes, focal brain lesions, connective tissue disorders (e.g.,
systemic lupus erythematosus), vasculitis, or metabolic and genetic
disorders can also cause movement disorders. Indeed, paroxysmal dyskinesia may be secondary to basal ganglia lesions, and various forms of
nonepileptic paroxysms, including dystonic posturing, bicycling, and
rhythmic boxing, may occur in children with decompensated maple
syrup urine disease.

Episodic Ataxias

Episodic ataxias form a clinically and genetically heterogeneous
group of diseases that manifest with recurrent truncal ataxia and
incoordination. Of the nine syndromes described so far, only two
(types 1 and 2) have been reported in a large number of families from
different ethnic groups. Type 1 is caused by pathogenic variants in
KCNA1 that encodes the voltage-­gated potassium channel Kv1.1. It
consists of brief episodes (seconds to minutes) of cerebellar ataxia
and occasional seizures with interictal myokymia as a main diagnostic feature. Type 2 is characterized by longer attacks (minutes to
hours) and interictal cerebellar signs. It is caused by variants in the
voltage-­gated calcium channel gene CACNA1A. This type is more

responsive than type 1 to acetazolamide; the drug can reduce the frequency and severity of attacks but not the interictal signs and symptoms. The other types of episodic ataxia are not well-­characterized,
but types 5, 6, and 9 have been associated with variants in CACNB4,
SLC1A3, and FGF14, respectively. Spells of episodic ataxia may also
occur in children with paroxysmal dyskinesia secondary to variants
in CACNA1A or PRRT2, in line with the previously discussed phenotypic pleiotropy of these conditions. Although epileptic seizures have
been primarily described in episodic ataxia type 1, they have also
been reported with the other types, specifically types 2 and 6. Glucose
transporter deficiency can at times present as episodic ataxia.

Motor Tics

These are movements that are under partial control and are associated
with an urge to do them and with subsequent relief. They are usually
exacerbated by emotions and often change in character over time.
Simple tics, which occur at some time in about one in five children,
involve one or two muscle groups; complex tics involve multiple tics
or muscle groups; and Tourette syndrome consists of multiple motor
tics and vocal tics for more than a year. In patients with tics who
have Tourette syndrome, there is often a family history of tics and/or
obsessive-­compulsive disorder or personality traits. Some rare cases
appear to occur after preceding streptococcal infections and have
been termed PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infections). PANS, on the other
hand, refers to an acute onset of obsessive-­compulsive symptoms

with other behavioral problems and often with tics but without the
association of streptococcal infections (acute-­onset neuropsychiatric
syndrome).

Benign Motoric Paroxysms in Infancy

Benign myoclonus of infancy consists of myoclonic jerks of the
extremities in wakefulness and sometimes also in sleep with no
concurrent epileptic EEG changes in a neurologically normal child.
Shuddering attacks are characterized by rapid tremors of the head,
shoulder, and trunk lasting a few seconds, often associated with eating, and recurring many times a day. Others have considered shuddering as an early manifestation of essential tremor because a family
history of essential tremor is often present. Infantile head atonic
attacks consist of repeated head drops, hundreds to thousands per
day, usually appearing at 3-­6 months of life and spontaneously subsiding by the first year of life, without concurrent EEG epileptic
activity. Spontaneous remission occurs in all three syndromes, usually within a few months. Video-­EEG is normal ictally and interictally in these syndromes but should be performed to differentiate
them from infantile spasms and epileptic myoclonus. Hereditary
chin trembling at a frequency faster than 3 Hz starting shortly
after birth and precipitated by stress has been described in several
families.

Brainstem Dysfunction

stress, an epileptic disorder, migraine, a vascular disorder, or a drug-­
related reaction.

OCULOMOTOR AND VISUAL ABNORMALITIES
Paroxysmal Tonic Upgaze of Childhood

This usually starts before 3 months of age and consists of protracted
attacks (hours to days) of continuous or episodic upward gaze deviation, during which horizontal eye movements are preserved. A
downbeating nystagmus occurs on downward gaze. Symptoms are
reduced or relieved by sleep, exacerbated by fatigue and infections,
and spontaneously remit after a few years. Up to 50% of patients
may have psychomotor and language delay. Although imaging and
laboratory tests were nonrevealing in the seminal cases, white matter lesions have been later reported in some patients. An association
with CACNA1A gene variants in a few patients who also suffered
from ataxia has been reported, pointing to etiologic and clinical
heterogeneity. The differential diagnosis includes drug reactions,
tics, Chediak-­Higashi disease, Rett syndrome, and Wilson disease.
Most of those, however, occur at a later age. Therapy with carbonic
anhydrase inhibitors or low-­dose levodopa/carbidopa may be helpful in severe cases. Concomitant absence epilepsy has been reported
in few cases.

Oculomotor Apraxia and Saccadic Intrusions

Decorticate or decerebrate posturing that mimics epileptic tonic seizures may be secondary to decompensated hydrocephalus, intracranial
hemorrhage, brainstem tumors, Chiari malformation, or other causes
of sudden rises in intracranial pressure that lead to brainstem dysfunction. The term cerebellar fits has been used to describe drop attacks,
extensor posturing with varying degrees of altered consciousness and
respiratory compromise secondary to crowding of the posterior fossa,
and near herniation in decompensated cerebellar tumors and certain
cases of Chiari malformation.

In oculomotor apraxia, saccadic eye movements are impaired. Sudden head turns compensating for lateral gaze impairment mimic seizures. This disorder may be idiopathic (Cogan congenital oculomotor
apraxia) or may occur in the context of Joubert syndrome, ataxia telangiectasia, spinocerebellar ataxias, or lysosomal storage diseases. A
selective loss of Purkinje cells required to suppress omnipause neurons
and initiate saccadic eye movement is believed to occur in some of the
disorders. Saccadic intrusions are involuntary, sudden, conjugate eye
movements away from the desired eye position. These are not necessarily pathologic.

Behavioral Conditions

Spasmus Nutans

Many behavioral disorders can be mistaken for epileptic seizures.
Pleasurable behaviors similar to masturbation may occur from
infancy onward and may consist of rhythmic rocking movements in
the sitting or lying position or rhythmic hip flexion and adduction.
Infantile gratification (masturbation), which is more common in
females, usually occurs at 2-­3 years of age and is often associated with
perspiration, irregular breathing, and grunting but no loss of consciousness. Occasionally this is associated with child abuse or with
other psychopathology. Stereotypies, or repetitive movements that
are more complex than tics and do not change and wax and wane as
do tics (e.g., head banging, head rolling, body rocking, and hand flapping), usually occur in neurologically impaired children. A mannerism is a pattern of socially acceptable, situational behavior that is seen
in particular situations such as gesturing when talking. Mannerisms
should not be confused with stereotypies, which are generally pervasive over almost every other activity, such as head shaking or hand
flapping in multiple situations. Stereotypies, unlike mannerisms,
increase with stress. Unlike tics and mannerisms, stereotypies usually start before the age of 3 years, involve more body parts, are more
rhythmic, and most importantly occur when a child is engrossed with
an object or activity of interest; children rarely try to suppress stereotypies. Panic and anxiety attacks have been described in children; at
times, these may be clinically indistinguishable from actual epileptic
seizures and therefore may necessitate video-­EEG monitoring. Rage
attacks usually occur in patients with a personality disorder and are
usually not seizures, although rare cases of partial seizures can manifest as rage attacks. Hyperventilation spells can be precipitated by
anxiety and are associated with dizziness, tingling, and, at times, carpopedal spasm. Transient global amnesia consists of isolated short-­
term memory loss for minutes to hours that occurs mostly in adults
but has been reported in children. The etiology can be emotional

This disorder presents with a triad of nystagmus, head tilt, and
head nodding. If diurnal fluctuation occurs, symptoms may look
like those of epileptic seizures. A brain MRI should be performed
because the triad has been associated with masses in the optic chiasm and third ventricle. Retinal disease should also be ruled out. In
the absence of these associations, remission occurs before 5 years
of age.

Opsoclonus-­Myoclonus Syndrome

In opsoclonus-­myoclonus syndrome, the term dancing eyes refers
to continuous, random, irregular, and conjugate eye movements
that may fluctuate in intensity. The finding usually accompanies
myoclonus and ataxia (dancing feet). Neuroblastoma (more commonly), encephalitis, and a presumed postinfectious etiology are
possible causes. In addition to treating the underlying etiology,
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), corticosteroids, rituximab,
and clonazepam are often needed. Recurrences are not infrequent,
and developmental delay is common. The opsoclonus and myoclonus may recur after treatment. The long-­term neurologic prognosis
remains poor, yet the presence of this syndrome is associated with
a favorable treatment response of a coexisting neuroblastoma. Opsoclonus with epileptic myoclonus has also been described in a child
with GLUT-­1 deficiency.

Daydreaming and Behavioral Staring

Staring may be a manifestation of absence seizures, which should be
differentiated from daydreaming and from behavioral staring because
of fatigue and inattention. This is common in children with attention-­
deficit disorder because these patients are often referred to rule out
absence seizures. Hyperventilation in the office precipitates absences
and is a useful clinical test. Episodes of staring only in certain settings

3638 Part XXV u The Nervous System
(e.g., school) are unlikely to be seizures. In addition, responsiveness
to stimulation such as touch and lack of interruption of playing activity characterize nonepileptic staring. Daydreaming occurs often in
children, and time-­out staring occurs in children when they are overwhelmed with external stimuli or with demands and shut down, ignoring their surroundings and staring.

Visual Hallucinations

Temporal lobe seizures can be associated with complex visual auras,
such as seeing people and places, often with subsequent focal seizure
manifestations. Occipital lobe seizures usually cause simple visual
hallucinations and may occur as isolated auras or may be accompanied by headache and nausea (Gastaut type of benign occipital
epilepsy), making them difficult to differentiate from migraine. Hallucinations in occipital seizures are characterized by colorful shapes,
circles, and spots seen for seconds and confined to one hemifield,
whereas migrainous auras usually last minutes and consist of black-­
and-­
white lines, scotomas, and/or fortification spectra that start
in the center of the vision. Visual snow is a phenomenon that can
be confused with occipital seizures and a migraine aura. It consists
of dynamic continuous tiny dots in all of the visual field lasting >3
months with at least two to four additional specific visual symptoms
(afterimages [i.e., palinopsia], enhanced visual phenomena [i.e.,
entotopic phenomena such as excessive floaters and photopsias],
photophobia, and impaired night vision [i.e., nyctalopia]). Although
it can occur in patients with migraine or with psychologic stress, the
underlying pathology is not clear. Unlike migraine, it is associated
with increased, rather than decreased, metabolism on PET scans of
the lingual gyrus, which is the visual memory area, and patients usually do not respond to antimigraine therapies. Alice in Wonderland
syndrome consists of the visual distortion of one’s body or surroundings (bigger, smaller, closer, or more distant) and has been associated
with migraine, epilepsy, acute infection such as Epstein-­Barr virus,
or fever. Hallucinations can also be secondary to other causes: drug
exposure, midbrain lesions, and psychiatric illnesses. In addition,
retinal-­associated hallucinations can occur in the form of flashes of
light in the context of inflammatory etiologies, trauma, or optic nerve
edema. Charles Bonnet syndrome is the occurrence of visual hallucinations caused by ocular-­origin visual loss or, at times, intracranial
pathology.

SLEEP-­RELATED DISORDERS (SEE ALSO
CHAPTER 31)

Paroxysmal nonepileptic sleep events are more common in epileptic
patients than in the general population, which makes their diagnosis difficult. The EEG pattern of frontal lobe epileptic seizures may
be similar to the one seen in normal arousals, making their diagnosis challenging, especially because they have nonspecific hypermotor
manifestations such as thrashing, body rocking, kicking, boxing, pedaling, bending, running, and various vocalizations. The diagnosis of
such epileptic seizures is made on the basis of highly stereotyped, usually brief (<1 minute) events arising several times a night from non–
rapid eye movement sleep.

Benign Sleep Myoclonus and Neonatal Sleep
Myoclonus

Physiologic sleep myoclonus consists of repetitive, usually bilateral,
rhythmic jerks involving the upper and lower limbs during non–rapid
eye movement (REM) sleep, sometimes mimicking clonic seizures.
Although the rule is that it is not stimulus sensitive, a slow (1-­Hz) rocking of the infant in a head-­to-­toe direction is a specific diagnostic test
that may sometimes reproduce the neonatal sleep myoclonus. The lack
of autonomic changes, occurrence only in sleep, and suppression by
awakenings may help in differentiating these events from epileptic seizures. Remission is spontaneous, usually at 2-­3 months of age. In older
children and adults, sleep myoclonus consists of random myoclonic
jerks of the limbs.

Non–Rapid Eye Movement Partial Arousal
Disorders

Brief nocturnal confusional arousals occur during slow-­wave sleep
and are normal in children. Such episodes can vary from chewing,
sitting up, and mumbling to agitated sleepwalking and usually last for
10-­15 minutes. With somnambulism, there is often a positive family
history, and it usually occurs 1-­3 hours after sleep onset. Night terrors similarly occur in deep sleep, most often at 2-­7 years of age and
more so in males. Stress increases the risk of both. In night terrors,
the child screams; appears terrified; has dilated pupils, tachycardia,
tachypnea, unresponsiveness, agitation, and thrashing that increase
with attempts to be consoled; is difficult to arouse; and may have little
or no vocalization. In older children with persistent night terrors,
an underlying psychologic etiology may be present. The diagnosis is
based on the history. However, rarely, video-­EEG monitoring may be
needed, especially if stereotyped motoric features are suggested by
the history. At times, the use of bedtime diazepam (0.2-­0.3 mg/kg)
or clonazepam (0.125-­0.5 mg) may help control the problem while
psychologic factors are being investigated. Restless legs syndrome
can cause painful leg dysesthesias that cause nocturnal arousals and
insomnia. It can be either genetic or associated with iron deficiency,
systemic illness, or some drugs such as antidepressants. Therapy
depends on treating the underlying cause and, if needed, on dopaminergic drugs, such as levodopa/carbidopa, or antiepileptics, such
as gabapentin.

Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Disorders

Unlike night terrors, nightmares tend to occur later during the night
and the child has a memory of the event. REM sleep behavior disorder consists of loss of atonia during REM sleep, enabling patients
to act out their dreams and thus mimicking nocturnal frontal or
temporal lobe seizures. It is more common in adults. Children with
autism and developmental delay are more likely to have it than other
children.

Sleep Transition Disorders

Nocturnal head banging (jactatio capitis nocturna), rolling, repetitive
limb movements, or body rocking often occur in infants and toddlers
as they are trying to fall asleep and can be mistaken for seizures or
spasms. They usually remit spontaneously by 5 years of age. No specific therapy is needed, but in exceptional cases, clonazepam at bedtime
may be used.

Narcolepsy-­Cataplexy Syndrome

Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hypnogogic hallucinations, and disturbed
nighttime sleep (see Chapter 31). The persistence of REM sleep atonia upon awakening or its intrusion during wakefulness leads to
sleep paralysis or cataplexy, respectively. Loss of tone in cataplexy
occurs in response to strong emotions and spreads from the face
downward, leading to a fall in a series of stages rather than a sudden
one. Consciousness is maintained in cataplexy. A selective loss of
hypocretin-­secreting neurons in the hypothalamus is at the origin
of this disorder. The fact that DQB1*0602 is a predisposing human
leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele identified in 85–95% of patients
with narcolepsy-­cataplexy suggests an autoimmune-­mediated neuronal loss. Secondary narcolepsy has also been described in children
with brain lesions affecting the brainstem or hypothalamic regions

Headaches
Andrew D. Hershey, Marielle Kabbouche,
and Joanne Kacperski
Headache is a common complaint in children and adolescents. Headaches can be a primary problem or occur as a symptom of another disorder (a secondary headache). Recognizing this difference is essential
for choosing the appropriate evaluation and treatment to ensure successful management of the headache. Primary headaches should be
thought of as a disease themselves and are most often present as recurrent, episodic headaches, and for most children are sporadic in their
presentation. This oftentimes creates confusion when patients and providers focus on the events (i.e., the headache, calling it a “migraine”)
rather than the disease itself.
The most common forms of primary headache in childhood are
migraine and tension-­type headache (Table 635.1). Other forms of
primary headache, including the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias
and cluster headaches, occur much less commonly. Primary headache
disorders can progress to very frequent or even daily headaches, with
chronic migraine and chronic tension-­type headache being recognized
as a problem for children and adolescents. These more frequent headaches can have an enormous impact on the life of the child and adolescent, as reflected in school absences and decreased school performance,
social withdrawal, and changes in family interactions. To reduce this
impact, a treatment strategy that incorporates acute treatments, preventive treatments, and biobehavioral therapies must be implemented.
Secondary headache is a headache that is a symptom of an underlying
illness (see Table 635.1). The underlying illness should be clearly present as a direct cause of the headaches with close association of timing
and symptomatology. This is often difficult when two or more common
conditions occur in close temporal association. This frequently leads to
the misdiagnosis of a primary headache as a secondary headache. This
is the case when the headaches caused by migraine are misdiagnosed as
sinus headaches. The key components of a secondary headache are the
likely direct cause-­and-­effect relationship between the headache and
the precipitating condition. In this regard, when the presumed cause
of the secondary headache has been treated (antibiotics) or given adequate time to recover (posttraumatic headache), the headache symptoms should resolve. If this does not occur, either the diagnosis must be
reevaluated or the effectiveness of the treatment reassessed.
In all instances of primary headaches, the neurologic examination
should be normal. If it is not normal or a secondary headache is suspected, this raises a red flag. The presence of an abnormal neurologic
examination (including fundoscopic) or unusual neurologic symptoms is
a key clue that additional investigation is warranted.

635.1 Migraine
Andrew D. Hershey, Marielle Kabbouche, and
Joanne Kacperski
Migraine is a disease that has a genetic basis (Table 635.2) and represents the most frequent reason recurrent headaches are brought to the
attention of parents and primary care providers, but it remains underrecognized and undertreated, particularly in children and adolescents.
Migraine is characterized by episodic attacks. These attacks are typically thought of as headaches, but in children there are also periodic
syndromes that may represent attacks of migraine. The headaches may
be moderate to severe in intensity, be focal in location, have a throbbing quality, and be associated with nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity,
and/or sound sensitivity. Compared with migraine in adults, migraine

3639

in children and adolescents may be shorter in duration and has a
bilateral, often bifrontal, location. The headaches can also be associated with an aura that may be typical (visual, sensory, or dysphasic) or
atypical (hemiplegic, Alice in Wonderland syndrome) (Tables 635.3-­
635.7). Migraine may present with a number of variants in children,
including abdominally related symptoms without headache and components of the periodic syndromes of childhood—also called episodic
disorders associated with migraine (see Table 635.1). Treatment of
migraine requires the incorporation of an acute treatment plan, a preventive treatment plan if the migraine occurs frequently or is disabling
or long lasting, and a biobehavioral plan to help cope with both the
acute attacks and frequent or persistent attacks if present.

EPIDEMIOLOGY

Up to 75% of children report having a significant headache by the
time they are 15 years of age. Recurrent headaches are less common
but remain highly frequent. Migraine has been reported to occur in
up to 10.6% of children between the ages of 5 and 15 years and up to
28% of older adolescents. When headaches are occurring more than
15 days per month, they are termed chronic migraine and may occur in
up to 1% of children and adolescents. The risk of conversion to a daily
headache becomes more likely as the frequency increases or ineffective
acute treatments are used. This explains the necessity to treat the headaches aggressively or prevent the headaches altogether, trying to block
transformation to chronic migraine.
Migraine can affect a patient’s life through school absences, limitation of home activities, and restriction of social activities. This can be
assessed through simple tools such as PedMIDAS (pediatric migraine
disability assessment tool). When headaches become more frequent,
their negative impact increases in magnitude. This can lead to further
complications, including anxiety and school avoidance, requiring a
more extensive treatment plan.

CLASSIFICATION AND CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Criteria have been established to guide the clinical and scientific study
of headaches; these are summarized in The International Classification
of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-­3). Table 635.1 contrasts the
different clinical types of migraine; Tables 635.3-­635.7 list the specific
criteria for migraine types.

Migraine Without Aura

Migraine without aura is the most common form of migraine in both
children and adults. The ICHD-­3 (see Table 635.3) requires this to be
recurrent (at least five headaches that meet the criteria, typically over
the past year, but no firm period is required). The recurrent episodic
nature helps differentiate this from a secondary headache and separates migraine from tension-­type headache. Because headaches may
first start in young childhood, this may limit the diagnosis in children
as they are just beginning to develop headaches.
The duration of the headache is defined as 4-­72 hours for adults.
It has been recognized that children may have shorter-­duration headaches, so an allowance has been made to reduce this duration to 2-­72
hours in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years. Note that
this duration is for the untreated or unsuccessfully treated headache.
Furthermore, if the child falls asleep with the headache, the entire sleep
period is considered part of the duration. These duration limits help
differentiate migraine from both short-­duration headaches, including
the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, and prolonged headaches, such
as those caused by idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri). Some prolonged headaches may still be migraine, but a
migraine that persists beyond 72 hours is classified as a variant termed
status migrainosus.
The quality of migraine pain is often, but not always, throbbing or
pounding. This may be difficult to elicit in young children, and drawings or demonstrations may help confirm the throbbing quality.
The location of the pain has classically been described as unilateral (hemicrania); in young children it is more commonly bilateral.
A more appropriate way to think of the location would therefore be
focal to differentiate it from the diffuse pain of tension-­type headaches.

Of particular concern is the exclusively occipital headache because
although these can be migraines, they are more frequently secondary to
another more proximate etiology such as posterior fossa abnormalities.
The headaches of migraine, when allowed to fully develop, often
worsen with activity. Worsening of the pain occurs classically in
adults when going up or down stairs. This history is often not elicited in children. A change in the child’s activity pattern can be easily
observed as a reduction in play or physical activity. Older children
may limit or restrict their sports activity or exercise during a headache attack.
The attacks may have a variety of associated symptoms. In younger
children, nausea and vomiting may be the most obvious symptoms and

often outweigh the headache itself. This often leads to the overlap with
several of the gastrointestinal periodic diseases, including recurrent
abdominal pain, recurrent vomiting, cyclic vomiting, and abdominal
migraine. The common feature among all of these related conditions is
an increased propensity among children with them for the later development of a typical description of a headache caused by migraine. Early
childhood recurrent vomiting may in fact be migraine, but the child is
not asked about or is unable to describe headache pain. This may occur
as early as infancy because babies with colic have a higher incidence of
migraine once they are able to express their symptoms. Once a clear
head pain becomes evident, the earlier diagnosis of a gastrointestinal
disorder is no longer appropriate.

When headache is present, vomiting raises the concern of a secondary headache, particularly related to increased intracranial pressure.
One of the red flags for this is the daily or near-­daily early morning vomiting or headaches waking the child up from sleep or with the Valsalva
maneuver. When the headaches associated with vomiting episodes
are sporadic and not worsening, it is more likely that the diagnosis
is migraine. Vomiting and headache caused by increased intracranial
pressure are frequently present on first awakening and remit with
maintenance of upright posture. In contrast, if a migraine is present on

Chapter 635 u Headaches
first awakening (a relatively infrequent occurrence in children), getting
up and going about normal, upright activities usually makes the headache and vomiting worse.
When the child matures, light and sound sensitivity (photophobia
and phonophobia) may become more apparent. This is either by direct
report of the patient or the interpretation by the parents of the child’s
activity because the parent may become aware of this symptom before
the child. These symptoms are likely a component of the hypersensitivity
that develops during an acute migraine attack and may also include smell
sensitivity (osmophobia) and touch sensitivity (cutaneous allodynia).
Although only the photophobia and phonophobia are components
of the ICHD-­3 criteria, these other symptoms are helpful in confirming the diagnosis and may be helpful in understanding the underlying
pathophysiology and determining the response to treatment. The final
ICHD-­3 requirement is the exclusion of causes of secondary headaches,
and this should be an integral component of the headache history.
Migraine typically runs in families, with reports of up to 90% of children having a first-­or second-­degree relative with recurrent headaches.
Given the underdiagnoses and misdiagnosis in adults, this is often not
recognized by the family, and a headache family history is required.
When a family history is not identified, this may be the result of either
a lack of awareness of migraine within the family or an underlying secondary headache in the child. Any child whose family, upon close and
both direct and indirect questioning, does not include individuals with
migraine or related syndromes (e.g., motion sickness, cyclic vomiting,
menstrual headache) should have an imaging procedure performed to
look for anatomic etiologies for headache.
In addition to the classifying features, there may be additional markers of a migraine disorder. These include such things as triggers (skipping meals, inadequate or irregular sleep, dehydration, and weather
changes are the most common), pattern recognition (associated with
menstrual periods in adolescents or Monday-­
morning headaches
resulting from changes in sleep patterns over the weekend and nonphysiologic early waking on Monday mornings for school), and prodromal symptoms (a feeling of irritability, tiredness, and food cravings
before the start of the headache) (Fig. 635.1). Although these additional
features may not be consistent, they do raise the index of suspicion for
migraine and provide a potential mechanism of intervention. In the
past, food triggers were considered widely common, but the majority
have either been discredited with scientific study or represent such a
small number of patients that they only need to be addressed when
consistently triggering the headache.

Migraine with Aura

The aura associated with migraine is a neurologic warning that a
migraine is going to occur. In the common forms, this can be the start
of a typical headache without migraine, or it may even occur in isolation. For a typical aura, the aura needs to be visual, sensory, or dysphasic, lasting longer than 5 minutes and less than 60 minutes, with the
headache starting within 60 minutes (see Table 635.4). The importance
of the aura lasting longer than 5 minutes is to differentiate the migraine
aura from a seizure with a postictal headache, whereas the 60-­minute
maximal duration is to separate migraine aura from the possibility of
a more prolonged neurologic event such as a transient ischemic attack.
The ICHD-­3 criteria have also added the requirements that for a diagnosis of aura, there needs to be a positive symptom and not just a loss
of function (i.e., flashing lights, tingling, not just blurring of vision).
The most common type of visual aura in children and adolescents
is photopsia (flashes of light or light bulbs going off everywhere).
These photopsias are often multicolored, and when gone, the child may
report not being able to see where the flash occurred. Less likely in
children are the typical adult auras, including fortification spectra (brilliant white zigzag lines resembling a starred pattern castle) or shimmering scotoma (sometimes described as a shining spot that grows or
a sequined curtain closing). In adults, the auras typically involve only
half the visual field, whereas in children they may be randomly dispersed. Blurred vision is often confused as an aura but is difficult to
separate from photophobia or difficulty concentrating during the pain
of the headache.

a specialist headache service. J Head Pain. 2016;17:94, Fig. 1.)

Sensory auras are less common. They typically occur unilaterally.
Many children describe this sensation as insects or worms crawling
from their hand, up their arm, to their face with a numbness following
this sensation. Once the numbness occurs, the child may have difficulty
using the arm because they have lost sensory input, and a misdiagnosis
of hemiplegic migraine may be made.
Dysphasic auras are the least common type of typical aura and have
been described as an inability or difficulty to respond verbally. The
patient afterward will describe an ability to understand what is being
asked but cannot answer back. This may be the basis of what in the
past has been referred to as confusional migraine, and special attention
needs to be paid to asking the child about this possibility and their
degree of understanding during the initial phases of the attack. Most of
the time, these episodes are described as a motor aphasia, and they are
often associated with sensory or motor symptoms.
Much less commonly, rarer forms of aura can occur, including hemiplegia (true weakness, not numbness, and may be familial), vertigo or
lower cranial nerve symptoms–brainstem aura (formerly called basilar-­
type and once thought to be caused by basilar artery dysfunction, now
thought to be a more brainstem-­based migraine with brainstem aura)
(see Table 635.4), and distortion (Alice in Wonderland syndrome).
Whenever these rarer forms of aura are present, further investigation is warranted. Not all motor auras can be classified as hemiplegic
migraine spectrum, and they should be differentiated from those specific migrainous events, because the diagnosis of hemiplegic migraine
has genetic, pathophysiologic, and therapeutic implications.
Hemiplegic migraine is one of the better-­known forms of rare
auras. This transient unilateral weakness usually lasts only a few
hours but may persist for days. Both familial and sporadic forms have
been described. The familial hemiplegic migraine is an autosomal
dominant disorder with pathogenic variants in three separate genes:
CACNA1A, ATP1A2, and SCN1A (see Table 635.2). Some patients
with familial hemiplegic migraine have other yet-­to-­be-­identified
genetic variants. Multiple polymorphisms have been described for
these genes. Hemiplegic migraines may be triggered by minor head

trauma, exertion, or emotional stress. The motor weakness is usually
associated with another aura symptom and may progress slowly over
20-­30 minutes, first with a visual aura and then, in sequence, with
sensory, motor, aphasic, and basilar auras. Headache is present in
more than 95% of patients and usually begins during the aura; headache may be unilateral or bilateral and may have no relationship to
the motor weakness. Some patients may develop attacks of coma with
encephalopathy, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis, and cerebral
edema. Long-­term complications may include seizures, repetitive
daily episodes of blindness, cerebellar signs with the development of
cerebellar atrophy, and mental disabilities.
Migraine with brainstem aura (basilar-­type migraine) was formerly considered a disease of the basilar artery because many of the
unique symptoms were attributed to dysfunction in this area of the
brainstem. Some of the symptoms described include vertigo, tinnitus,
diplopia, blurred vision, scotoma, ataxia, and an occipital headache.
The pupils may be dilated, and ptosis may be evident.
Syndrome of transient headache and neurologic deficits with CSF
lymphocytosis (HaNDL) describes transient migraine-­like headaches
associated with neurologic deficits (motor, sensory, language impairments) and CSF showing pleocytosis. It is considered a self-­limited
migraine-­like syndrome of unknown etiology and is rarely reported in
the pediatric population.
Childhood periodic syndromes are a group of potentially related
symptoms that occur with increased frequency in children with
migraine. The hallmark of these symptoms is the recurrent episodic
nature of the events. Some of these have included gastrointestinal-­
related symptoms (colic, motion sickness, recurrent abdominal
pain, recurrent vomiting including cyclic vomiting, and abdominal
migraine), sleep disorders (sleepwalking, sleep talking, and night terrors), unexplained recurrent fevers, and even seizures.
The gastrointestinal symptoms span the spectrum from the relatively mild (motion sickness on occasional long car rides) to severe episodes of uncontrollable vomiting that may lead to dehydration and the
need for hospital admission to receive fluids. These latter episodes may
occur on a predictable time schedule and are called cyclic vomiting.
During these attacks, the child may appear pale and frightened but does
not lose consciousness. After a period of deep sleep, the child awakens
and resumes normal play and eating habits as if the vomiting had not
occurred. Many children with cyclic vomiting have a positive family
history of migraine and as they grow older have a higher-­than-­average
likelihood of developing migraine. Cyclic vomiting may be responsive
to migraine-­specific therapies; careful attention is needed for fluid
replacement if the vomiting is excessive. Cyclic vomiting of migraine
must be differentiated from gastrointestinal disorders, including intestinal obstruction (malrotation, intermittent volvulus, duodenal web,
duplication cysts, superior mesenteric artery compression, and internal hernias), peptic ulcer, gastritis, giardiasis, chronic pancreatitis, and
Crohn disease. Abnormal gastrointestinal motility and pelviureteric
junction obstruction can also cause cyclic vomiting. Metabolic causes
include disorders of amino acid metabolism (heterozygote ornithine
transcarbamylase deficiency), organic acidurias (propionic acidemia,
methylmalonic acidemia), fatty acid oxidation defects (medium-­chain
acyl-­coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency), disorders of carbohydrate metabolism (hereditary fructose intolerance), acute intermittent
porphyria, and structural central nervous system lesions (posterior
fossa brain tumors, subdural hematomas, or effusions). The diagnosis
is a diagnosis of exclusion, and children will need a full workup to be
labeled as having cyclic vomiting syndrome. Cyclic vomiting syndrome
is more frequent in younger children and will gradually transform into
a typical migraine attack by puberty (see Chapter 390).
The diagnosis of abdominal migraine can be confusing but can be
thought of as a migraine without the headache. Like a migraine, it is
an episodic disorder characterized by midabdominal pain with pain-­
free periods between attacks. At times this pain is associated with nausea and vomiting (thus crossing into the recurrent abdominal pain or
cyclic vomiting spectrum). The pain is usually described as dull and
may be moderate to severe. The pain may persist from 1 to 72 hours,
and although it is usually in the midline, it may be periumbilical or

poorly localized by the child. To meet the criteria of abdominal
migraine, the child must complain at the time of the abdominal pain
of at least two of the following: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or pallor.
Similar to cyclic vomiting, a thorough history and physical examination with appropriate laboratory studies must be completed to rule out
an underlying gastrointestinal disorder as a cause of the abdominal
pain. Careful questioning about the presence of headache or head pain
needs to be addressed directly to the child because many times, this is
truly a migraine but in the child’s mind (and the parents’ observation),
the abdominal symptoms are paramount.

DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

A thorough history and physical examination, including a neurologic
examination with special focus on headache, has been shown to be the
most sensitive indicator of an underlying etiology. The history needs to
include a thorough evaluation of the prodromal symptoms, any potential
triggering events or timing of the headaches, associated neurologic symptoms, and a detailed characterization of the headache attacks, including
frequency, severity, duration, associated symptoms, use of medication,
and disability. The disability assessment should include the impact on
school, home, and social activities and can easily be assessed with tools
such as PedMIDAS. A family history of headaches and any other neurologic, psychiatric, and general health conditions is also important both
for identification of migraine within the family and the identification
of possible secondary headache disorders. The familial penetrance of
migraine is so robust that the absence of a family history of migraine
or its equivalent phenomena should raise the concern that the diagnosis
may not be migraine and warrants further history taking, referral to a
headache specialist, or investigation. The lack of a family history may be
the result of a lack of awareness of the family of the migraine (“doesn’t
everybody get headaches?”). When headaches are refractory, a history of
potential comorbid conditions, which includes mood disorders and illicit
substance use, especially in teenagers, that may influence adherence
and acceptability of the treatment plan, may also need to be addressed.
Patients with difficult-­to-­treat chronic migraines may have raised intracranial pressure; a lumbar puncture with lowering of the pressure may
resolve the migraine. These patients may not have papilledema. In addition, disorders such as cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with
subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), Moyamoya
disease, reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, and strokelike
migraine attacks after radiation therapy (SMART) may initially present
with migraines (Table 635.8).
Neuroimaging is warranted when the neurologic examination is
abnormal or unusual neurologic features occur during the migraine;
when the child has headaches that awaken the child from sleep or that
are present on first awakening and remit with upright posture; when
the child has brief headaches that only occur with cough or bending
over; when the headache is mostly in the occipital area; and when the
child has migrainous headache with an absolutely negative family history of migraine or its equivalent (e.g., motion sickness, cyclic vomiting; Table 635.9). In this case, an MRI is the imaging method of choice
because it provides the highest sensitivity for detecting posterior fossa
lesions and does not expose the child to radiation.
In the child with a headache that is instantaneously at its worst at
onset, a CT scan looking for blood is the best initial test; if it is negative, a lumbar puncture should be done looking especially for xanthochromia of the CSF. There is no evidence that laboratory studies or an
electroencephalogram is beneficial in a typical migraine without aura
or migraine with aura.

TREATMENT

Table 635.10 outlines the drugs used to manage migraine headaches
in children. The American Academy of Neurology established useful
practice guidelines for the management of migraine as follows:
• Reduction of headache frequency, severity, duration, and disability
• Reduction of reliance on poorly tolerated, ineffective, or unwanted
acute pharmacotherapies
• Improvement in quality of life
• Avoidance of acute headache medication escalation

To accomplish these goals, three components need to be incorporated into the treatment plan: (1) an acute treatment strategy should
be developed for stopping a headache attack on a consistent basis with
return to function as soon as possible, with the goal being 2 hours
maximum; (2) a preventive treatment strategy should be considered
when the headaches are frequent (one or more per week) and disabling;
and (3) biobehavioral therapy should be started, including a discussion
of adherence, elimination of barriers to treatment, and healthy habit
management.

Acute Treatment

Management of an acute attack is designed to provide headache
freedom as quickly as possible with return to normal function. This
mainly includes two groups of medicines: nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and triptans. Small-­
molecule calcitonin
gene–related peptide modulator (CGRP receptor antagonists) therapies are approved for patients 18 and older for acute headache treatment, but they are still under investigation for efficacy and tolerability
in children and adolescents. Most headaches caused by migraine in
children will respond to appropriate doses of NSAIDs when they are
administered at the onset of the headache attack. Ibuprofen has been
well documented to be effective at a dose of 7.5-­10.0 mg/kg and is
often preferred; however, acetaminophen (15 mg/kg) can be effective
in those with a contraindication to NSAIDs. Special concern for the
use of ibuprofen or other NSAIDs includes ensuring that the children can recognize and respond to onset of the headache. This means
discussing with the child the importance of telling the teacher when
the headache starts at school and ensuring that proper dosing guidelines and permission have been provided to the school. In addition,
medication overuse needs to be avoided, limiting NSAIDs and other
pain medications for headache (or any combination of nonprescription analgesics) to not more than 2-­3 times per week. The limitation
of any analgesic to not more than three headaches per week is necessary to prevent the transformation of the migraines into medication-­
overuse headaches (MOHs). If a patient has maximized the weekly
allowance of analgesics, the patient’s next step is to only use hydrating
fluids for the rest of the week as an abortive approach. If ibuprofen
is not effective, naproxen sodium also may be tried in similar doses.
Aspirin is also a reasonable option but is usually reserved for older
children (>16 years). Use of other NSAIDs has yet to be studied in
pediatric migraine. The goal of the acute medication should be relief
of headache and associated symptoms within 1 hour, with return to
function in 10 of 10 headaches.
When an attack of migraine is especially severe, NSAIDs alone may
not be sufficient. In this case, a triptan may be considered. Multiple
studies have demonstrated their effectiveness and tolerability. There
are currently three triptans that are approved by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of episodic migraine
in the pediatric population. Almotriptan is approved for the treatment of acute migraine in adolescents (ages 12-­17 years). Rizatriptan
is approved for the treatment of migraine in children as young as age
6 years. The intranasal formulation of zolmitriptan is also approved
by the FDA in the United States for use in children ages 12 and over.
Several studies have shown it to provide rapid and effective relief, and
it has been demonstrated to be well tolerated for treatment of acute
migraine in patients 12 years and older. Zolmitriptan nasal spray may
be of particular benefit to those with nausea and in patients who have
difficulty swallowing tablets.
The combination of naproxen sodium and sumatriptan has been
studied and may be effective in children. Controlled clinical trials demonstrate that intranasal sumatriptan is safe and effective in children
older than age 8 years with moderate to severe migraine. At present,
pediatric studies showing the effectiveness of oral sumatriptan are lacking, and there is insufficient evidence to support the use of subcutaneous sumatriptan in children. For most adolescents, dosing is the same
as for adults; a reduction in dose is made for children weighing less
than 40 kg. The triptans vary by rapidity of onset and biologic half-­life.
This is related to both their variable lipophilicity and dose. Clinically,
60–70% of patients respond to the first triptan tried, with 60–70% of

the patients who did not respond to the first triptan responding to the
next triptan. Therefore in the patient who does not respond to the first
triptan in the desired way (rapid reproducible response without relapse
or side effects), it is worthwhile to try a different triptan. The most
common side effects of the triptans are caused by their mechanism of
action—tightness in the jaw, chest, and fingers as a result of vascular
constriction and a subsequent feeling of grogginess and fatigue from
the central serotonin effect. The vascular constriction symptoms can be
alleviated through adequate fluid hydration during an attack.
The most effective way to administer acute treatment is with the
recognition that NSAIDs and triptans have different mechanisms of
action. NSAIDs are used for all headaches, mild to severe, with their
use being restricted to fewer than two to three attacks per week; the
triptans are added for moderate to severe headaches, with their use
being restricted to not more than six to eight attacks per month. For an
acute attack, the NSAIDs can be repeated once in 3-­4 hours, if needed
for that specific attack, and the triptans can be repeated once in 2 hours
if needed. It is important to consider the various formulations available, and these options should be discussed with pediatric patients and
their parents, especially if a child is unable to swallow pills or take an
oral dose because of nausea and/or vomiting.
Because vascular dilation is a common feature of migraine that may
be responsible for some of the facial flushing, followed by paleness
and the lightheaded feeling accompanying the attacks, fluid hydration
should be integrated into the acute treatment plan. For oral hydration,
this can include the sports drinks that combine electrolytes and sugar
to provide the intravascular rehydration.
Antiemetics are used for acute treatment of the nausea and vomiting. Further study has identified that their unique mechanism of
effectiveness in headache treatment is related to their antagonism of
dopaminergic neurotransmission. Therefore the antiemetics with
the most robust dopamine antagonism (i.e., prochlorperazine and

metoclopramide) have the best efficacy. These can be very effective for
status migrainosus or a migraine that is unresponsive to NSAIDs and
triptans. They require intravenous administration because other forms
of administration of these drugs are less effective than the NSAIDs or
triptans. When combined with ketorolac and intravenous fluids in the
emergency department or an acute infusion center, intravenous antiemetics can be highly effective. When they are not effective, further
inpatient treatment may be required using dihydroergotamine (DHE),
which will mean an admission to an inpatient unit for more aggressive
therapy of an intractable attack.
There are also a growing number of devices that appear to be effective for the acute treatment of headache attacks caused by migraine.
Currently both a remote electrical neuromodulation (REN) device and
a vagal nerve stimulator are approved for the acute treatment of attacks
down to age 12. These devices have the benefit of improving the adolescent’s locus of control, as they can modulate the degree and duration
of treatment, without the need to swallow a pill.

Emergency Department Treatments for Intractable
Headaches

When an acute migraine attack does not respond to the recommended
outpatient regimen and the headache is disabling, more aggressive
therapeutic approaches are available and may be necessary to prevent
further increase in the duration and frequency of headaches. These
migraines fall into the classification of status migrainosus (migraine
attack lasting more than 72 hours), and patients may need to be referred
to an infusion center, the emergency room, or an inpatient unit.
Available specific treatments for migraine headache in an emergency room setting include the following: antidopaminergic medications such as prochlorperazine and metoclopramide, NSAIDs such as
ketorolac, vasoconstrictor medications such as DHE, and antiepileptic
drugs such as sodium valproate.

3648 Part XXV u The Nervous System
Antidopaminergic Drugs: Prochlorperazine and
Metoclopramide

The use of antidopaminergic medications is not limited to controlling
the nausea and vomiting often present during a migraine headache.
Their potential pharmacologic effect may be a result of their antidopamine property and the underlying pathologic process involving
the dopaminergic system during a migraine attack. Prochlorperazine
is highly effective in aborting an attack in the emergency room when
given intravenously with a bolus of intravenous fluid. Results show
a 75% improvement with 50% headache freedom at 1 hour and 95%
improvement with 60% headache freedom at 3 hours. Prochlorperazine may be more effective than metoclopramide. The average dose of
metoclopramide is 0.13-­0.15 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 10 mg
given intravenously over 15 minutes. The average dose of prochlorperazine is 0.15 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 10 mg. These medications are usually well-­tolerated, but extrapyramidal reactions are more
frequent in children than in older persons. An acute extrapyramidal
reaction can be controlled in the emergency room with 25-­50 mg of
diphenhydramine given intravenously. There is no need for premedication with diphenhydramine to prevent side effects. Diphenhydramine
should only be used if needed when side effects are present.

Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs: Ketorolac

It is known that an aseptic inflammation occurs in the central nervous
system as a result of the effect of multiple reactive peptides in patients
with migraines, including the CGRP molecules. Ketorolac is often used
in the emergency department as monotherapy for a migraine attack
or in combination with other drugs. In monotherapy, the response to
ketorolac is 55.2% improvement. When ketorolac is combined with
prochlorperazine, the response rate jumps to 93%.

Antiepileptic Drugs: Sodium Valproate

Antiepileptic drugs have been used as prophylactic treatment for
migraine headache for years with adequate double-­blinded, controlled
studies on their efficacy in adults. The mechanism by which sodium valproate acutely aborts migraine headaches is not well understood. Sodium
valproate is given as a bolus of 15-­20 mg/kg push (over 10 minutes). This
intravenous load is followed by an oral dose (15-­20 mg/day) in the 4
hours after the injection. Patients may benefit from a short-­term preventive treatment with an extended-­release form after discharge from the
emergency room for 2 weeks to keep the level in the therapeutic range.
Sodium valproate is usually well tolerated. Patients should receive a fluid
load during the procedure to prevent a possible hypotensive episode.

Triptans

Subcutaneous sumatriptan (0.06 mg/kg) has an overall efficacy of 72%
at 30 minutes and 78% at 2 hours, with a recurrence rate of 6%. Because
children tend to have a shorter duration of headache, a recurrence rate of
6% would seem appropriate for this population. DHE, if recommended
for the recurrences, should not be given in the 8 hours after triptan
use. Triptans are contraindicated in patients treated with ergotamine
within 24 hours and within 2 weeks of treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Triptans may rarely produce serotonin syndrome in
patients taking a serotonin receptor reuptake inhibitor. Both triptans
and ergotamine are contraindicated in hemiplegic migraines.

Dihydroergotamine

DHE is a medication used as a vasoconstrictor to abort the vascular
phase of migraine headache. The effectiveness is discussed in detail in
the section “Inpatient Management of Intractable Migraine and Status Migrainosus,” next. One dose of DHE can be effective for abortive
treatment in the emergency department. Emergency room treatment
of migraine shows a recurrence rate of 29% at 48-­72 hours, with 6%
of patients needing even more aggressive therapy in an inpatient unit.

Inpatient Management of Intractable Migraine and
Status Migrainosus

About 6–7% of patients fail acute treatment in the emergency department. These patients are usually admitted for 3-­5 days to an inpatient

unit and receive extensive parenteral treatment. Admission is reserved
for patients who are disabled by their acute migraine attack and those
who did not experience relief from all other abortive approaches as
discussed earlier: (1) for acute status migrainosus, (2) for exacerbation
of an underlying chronic migraine when the episode fits the criteria
for a status migrainosus occurring on top of their continuous baseline
headache, and (3) for severe analgesic overuse headache that did not
respond to any other recommended abortive therapy. The goal of inpatient treatment is to control a headache that has been unresponsive to
other outpatient abortive therapies and is disabling to the child. Treatment protocols include the use of DHE, antiemetics, sodium valproate,
and other drugs.

Dihydroergotamine

Ergots are one of the oldest treatments for migraine headache. DHE is
a parenteral form used for acute exacerbations. Its effect stems from the
5HT1A-­1B-­1D-­1F receptor agonist affinity and central vasoconstriction.
DHE has greater α-­adrenergic antagonist activity and is less vasoconstrictive peripherally. Before initiation of an intravenous ergot protocol, a full history should be obtained and a neurologic examination
performed to rule out any possibility of secondary headache before the
initiation of the treatment, keeping in mind that patients with migraine
can still develop a secondary headache. Females of childbearing age
should be evaluated for pregnancy before ergots are administered.
The DHE protocol consists of the following: Patients are premedicated with 0.13-­0.15 mg/kg of prochlorperazine 30 minutes before
the DHE dose (maximum of three prochlorperazine doses to prevent
extrapyramidal syndrome; after three doses of prochlorperazine, a
non–dopamine antagonist antiemetic should be used, such as ondansetron). A dose of 0.5-­1.0 mg of DHE is used (depending on age and tolerability) every 8 hours until headache freedom is achieved or headache
returns back to baseline for those with a continuous headache. The first
dose should be divided into two half-­doses separated by 30 minutes if
the patient is naïve to treatment with DHE. When the headache ceases,
an extra dose of DHE is given in an attempt to prevent recurrence after
discharge. The response to this protocol is a 97% improvement and
77% headache freedom. The response is noticeable by the fifth dose;
the drug can reach its maximum effects after the tenth dose. Common
side effects of DHE include nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort,
a flushed face, muscle cramping, and increased blood pressure. The
maximum dose used in this protocol is 15 mg total of DHE.

Sodium Valproate

Sodium valproate is used when DHE is contraindicated or has been ineffective. One adult study recommends the use of valproate sodium as follows: bolus with 15 mg/kg (maximum of 1,000 mg), followed by 5 mg/kg
every 8 hours until headache freedom or up to a maximum of 10 doses.
An extra dose is recommended after the headache ceases to prevent
recurrence. This protocol was studied in adults with chronic daily headaches and showed an 80% improvement. It is well tolerated and is useful
in children when DHE is ineffective, contraindicated, or not tolerated.

Other Inpatient Therapies

During an inpatient admission for status migrainosus, other services
such as behavioral medicine and holistic medicine should be involved
if they are available. The behavioral medicine staff can play a major role
in talking to patients about their specific triggers and can also evaluate school, as well as home and social stressors. The staff would also
initiate some coping skills training during the admission and evaluate
the necessity for further outpatient follow-­up for cognitive-­behavioral
therapy, biofeedback, or treatment for other comorbidities. The holistic
medicine staff, when consulted, can offer holistic approaches to pain
control, including relaxation techniques, medical massage, and craniosacral therapy.

Preventive Therapy

When the headaches are frequent (more than one headache per
week) or disabling (causing the patient to miss school, home, or social
activities or with a PedMIDAS score >20), preventive or prophylactic

Chapter 635 u Headaches
therapy may be warranted. The goal of this therapy should be to reduce
the frequency to one headache or fewer per week and level of disability
(PedMIDAS score <10). Prophylactic agents should be given for at least
4-­6 months at an adequate dose and then weaned over several weeks.
Evidence in adult studies has begun to demonstrate that persistent
frequent headaches foreshadow an increased risk of progression with
decreased responsiveness and increased risk of refractoriness in the
future. It is unclear whether this also occurs in children and/or adolescents and whether early treatment of headache in childhood prevents
development of refractory headache in adulthood.
Multiple preventive medications have been used for migraine prophylaxis in children. When analyzed as part of a practice parameter,
one medication, flunarizine (a calcium channel blocking agent), demonstrated a level of effectiveness viewed as substantial; it is not available
in the United States. Flunarizine is typically given at 5 mg orally daily
and increased after 1 month to 10 mg orally daily, with a month off the
drug every 4-­6 months.
A commonly used preventive therapy for headache and migraine
is amitriptyline. Typically, a dose of 1 mg/kg daily at dinner or in the
evening is effective. However, this dose needs to be reached slowly (i.e.,
over weeks, with an increase every 2 weeks until the goal is reached)
to minimize side effects and improve tolerability. Side effects include
sleepiness and those related to amitriptyline’s anticholinergic activity. Weight gain has been observed in adults using amitriptyline but
is a less frequent occurrence in children. Amitriptyline does have
the potential to exacerbate prolonged QT syndrome, so it should be
avoided in patients with this diagnosis and looked for in patients taking
the drug who complain of a rapid or irregular heart rate.
Antiepileptic medications are also used for migraine prophylaxis,
with topiramate, valproic acid, and levetiracetam having been demonstrated to be effective in adults. There are limited studies in children for
migraine prevention, but all of these medications have been assessed
for safety and tolerability in children with epilepsy.
Topiramate has become widely used for migraine prophylaxis in
adults. Topiramate was also demonstrated to be effective in an adolescent study. This study demonstrated that a 25-­mg dose twice a day
was equivalent to placebo, whereas a 50-­mg dose twice a day was superior. Thus it appears that the adult dosing schedule is also effective in
adolescents with an effective dosage range of 50 mg twice a day to 100
mg twice a day. This dose needs to be reached slowly to minimize the
cognitive slowing associated with topiramate use. Side effects include
weight loss, paresthesias, kidney stones, lowered bicarbonate levels,
decreased sweating, and rarely glaucoma and changes in serum transaminases. In addition, in adolescent females taking birth control pills,
the lowering of the effectiveness of the birth control by topiramate
needs to be discussed.
A comparative effectiveness study in children (8-­17 years) of the two
most common treatments (amitriptyline and topiramate) compared
with placebo (the CHAMP study) demonstrated that all three treatments were effective, but there was not statistical superiority for amitriptyline or topiramate over placebo.
Valproic acid has long been used for epilepsy in children and has
been demonstrated to be effective in migraine prophylaxis in adults.
The effective dose in children appears to be 10 mg/kg orally twice a
day. Side effects of weight gain, ovarian cysts, and changes in serum
transaminases and platelet counts need to be monitored. Other antiepileptics, including lamotrigine, levetiracetam, zonisamide, gabapentin,
and pregabalin, are also used for migraine prevention.
β Blockers have long been used for migraine prevention. The studies on β blockers have a mixed response pattern with variability both
between β blockers and between patients with a given β blocker. Propranolol is the best studied for pediatric migraine prevention with
unequivocally positive results. The contraindication for the use of
propranolol in children with asthma or allergic disorders or diabetes
and the increased incidence of depression in adolescents using propranolol limit its use somewhat. It may be effective for a mixed subtype
of migraine (basilar-­type migraine with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome). This syndrome has been reported to be responsive
to propranolol. α-­Blockers and calcium channel blockers, aside from

3649

flunarizine, also have been used in pediatric migraine; their effectiveness, however, remains unclear.
In very young children, cyproheptadine may be effective in the prevention of migraine or the periodic syndromes of childhood. Young
children tend to tolerate the increased appetite induced by the cyproheptadine and tend not to be subject to the lethargy seen in older children and adults; the weight gain is limiting once children start to enter
puberty. Typical dosing is 0.1-­0.2 mg/kg orally twice a day.
Nutraceuticals are popular choices, especially among families who
prefer a more natural approach to headache treatment. Despite studies
showing success of these therapies in adults, few studies have shown
effectiveness in pediatric headaches. Riboflavin (vitamin B2), at doses
ranging from 25 to 400 mg, is the most widely studied with good results.
Side effects are minimal and include bright yellow urine, diarrhea, and
polyuria. Coenzyme Q10 supplementation may be effective in reducing migraine frequency at doses of 1-­2 mg/kg/day. Butterbur is also
effective in reducing headaches, with minimal side effects, including
burping. Use in children has been limited to avoid the potential toxicity of butterbur-­containing pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which are naturally
contained and are a known carcinogen and toxic to the liver.
OnabotulinumtoxinA is the first medication FDA-­
approved for
chronic migraine in adults. There are studies in children indicating its
effectiveness; use in children is considered off-­label. The limited available studies revealed the following: The average dose used was 188.5
units ± 32 units with a minimum dose of 75 units and maximum of
200 units. The average age of patients receiving the treatment was
16.8 ± 2.0 years (minimum 11 years; maximum 21 years). OnabotulinumtoxinA injections improved disability scores (PedMIDAS) and
headache frequency in pediatric chronic daily headache patients and
chronic migraine in this age-­group. OnabotulinumtoxinA not only had
a positive effect on the disability scoring for these young patients with
headache but was also able to transform the headaches from chronic
daily to intermittent headaches in more than 50% of the patients.
Eptinezumab, erenumab, galcanezumab, and fremanezumab—humanized monoclonal antibodies against the CGRP or its receptor—have demonstrated safety and efficacy in adult patients with migraine. The FDA has
approved these agents for use in adults with migraine, including chronic
migraine. There are no completed studies in children and adolescents.

Biobehavioral Therapy

Biobehavioral evaluation and therapy are essential for effective
migraine management. This includes identification of behavioral barriers to treatment, such as a child’s shyness or limitation in notifying a
teacher of the start of a migraine or a teacher’s unwillingness to accept
the need for treatment. Additional barriers include a lack of recognition of the significance of the headache problem and reverting to bad
habits once the headaches have responded to treatment. Adherence is
equally important for acute and preventive treatment. The need to have
a sustained response long enough to prevent relapse (to stay on preventive medication) is often difficult when the child starts to feel better.
Establishing a defined treatment goal (one or two or fewer headaches
per month for 4-­6 months) helps with acceptance.
Because many of the potential triggers for attacks of migraine (skipping meals, dehydration, decreased or altered sleep) are related to a
child’s daily routine, a discussion of healthy habits is a component of
biobehavioral therapy. This should include adequate fluid intake without caffeine, regular exercise, not skipping meals and making healthy
food choices, and adequate (8-­9 hours) sleep on a regular basis. Sleep
is often difficult in adolescents because middle and high schools often
have very early start times, and the adolescent’s sleep architecture features a shift to later sleep onset and waking. This has been one of the
explanations for worsening headaches during the school year in general and at the beginning of the school year and week.
Biofeedback-­assisted relaxation and cognitive-­behavioral therapy
(usually in combination with amitriptyline) are effective for both acute
and preventive therapy and may be incorporated into this multiple
treatment strategy. This provides the child with a degree of self-­control
over the headaches and may further help the child cope with frequent
headaches.

3650 Part XXV u The Nervous System
Young Adults and the Transition of Headache Care
from a Pediatric to an Adult Provider

Migraine is a chronic condition that may first present in childhood.
Males are diagnosed at a younger age than females; however, during
development, the prevalence becomes highest among women, starting
at puberty. Some adolescents and women report migraine associated
with menses; the pain symptoms are described as lasting longer and
having a higher intensity. The role of oral contraceptive pills (OCPs)
is often a topic of discussion among female adolescents and young
women. Studies have shown improvement of menstrual migraine in
adult patients taking oral estrogens and progesterone; similar studies
have not been done in adolescents. OCPs are not approved by the FDA
for treatment of menstrual migraine; they have been associated with an
increased risk of stroke among women with migraine aura. Therefore
their use in adolescents as a prophylactic agent is not advised.
Comorbid conditions such as anxiety and depression are seen with a
high prevalence among adults with migraine; however, the prevalence
among adolescent patients remains unclear. Diagnostic tools capable
of differentiating mood disorders from pain symptoms in the pediatric
population are limited, which makes identifying those at risk challenging. However, it is important to keep in mind the potential of mood
disorders, especially in young adults.
Remission of migraine is seen in up to 34% of adolescents, and
almost 50% continue to have migraine persisting into adulthood. Successful transition of care from a pediatric to an adult provider has been
shown to improve outcomes in patients with chronic disease.
Early diagnosis and treatment of migraine can help minimize the
progression of the disease in adults. This, together with careful screening for comorbid conditions, may help identify those at risk for refractory migraine, minimize disability, and improve overall headache
outcomes.

635.2 Secondary Headaches
Andrew D. Hershey, Marielle Kabbouche, and
Joanne Kacperski
Headaches can be a common symptom of other underlying illnesses.
In recognition of this, the ICHD-­3 has classified potential secondary
headaches (see Table 635.1). The key to the diagnosis of a secondary
headache is to recognize the underlying cause and demonstrate a direct
cause and effect. Until this has been done, the diagnosis is speculative.
This is especially true when the suspected etiology is common.
Headache is a common occurrence after concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), reported in as many as 86% of high school
and college athletes who have suffered from head trauma (see Chapter
729). Although there are no strict criteria for determining who will
develop persistent headache after concussion, it is important to gather
information to rule out other secondary headaches and significant primary headache disorders and to identify those who may be at risk for
persistent headache after concussion.
Chronic or persistent headaches are headaches that last for more
than 3 months after head trauma. This definition is consistent with the
classification of persistent posttraumatic headaches in the ICHD-­3.
Although concussion and posttraumatic headache are rapidly evolving areas of study, there is an unfortunate lack of definitive scientific
evidence at this time on these topics in pediatrics. The ICHD-­3 classifies posttraumatic headaches as acute if they last less than 3 months
and persistent if they last more than 3 months after injury. This period
is consistent with ICHD-­II diagnostic criteria, although the term persistent has been adopted in place of chronic. Although the ICHD-­3
criteria state that posttraumatic headaches begin within 7 days after
injury to the head or after regaining consciousness, this 7-­day cutoff is
arbitrary, and some experts believe that headaches may develop after a
longer interval. Some studies have shown that ∼50% of children with

posttraumatic headache 3 months after concussion had a history of
preexisting headaches, and 31% had a history of migraine or probable
migraine before the injury. Furthermore, 56% of patients with headaches at 3 months after injury had a family history of migraine. Based
on clinical experiences of patients with prolonged postconcussion
symptoms, those with prior concussion and persistent posttraumatic
headaches, preexisting anxiety and/or depression, and maladaptive
coping styles may also be at higher risk for persistent posttraumatic
headache.
Despite being classified as a secondary headache, a posttraumatic
headache generally presents with clinical features that are observed in
primary headache disorders, including tension-­type, migraine, and
cervicogenic headaches. The few reports that have thus far assessed the
characteristics of posttraumatic headache in the pediatric population
have also reported various proportions of migraine or tension-­type
characteristics, with the reported prevalence of each varying among
individual studies.
Although headache is reported to be the most common symptom
after concussion, there is a paucity of studies regarding the safety and
efficacy of headache treatments for persistent posttraumatic headaches.
Posttraumatic headaches may be difficult to treat. There are currently
no established guidelines for their treatment, especially when persistent, and practices can vary widely. Most treatment algorithms proposed have been extrapolated from the primary headache literature
and small noncontrolled trials of posttraumatic headache regimens.
When posttraumatic headaches become problematic or persistent, a
multidimensional management approach, including pharmacologic
intervention, physical rehabilitation, and cognitive-­behavioral therapies, are often used. Management should therefore be relevant to the
type of headache and focused on the clinical needs of the child.
Like primary headache disorders, these headaches can have a substantial effect on the child’s life, leading to lost school days and withdrawal from social interactions. Referral for biobehavioral therapy and
coping strategies may be necessary. Adherence should be promoted
and can be optimized by educating both the patient and the family
about the proper use of acute and prophylactic medications, establishing realistic expectations (including expectations for recovery), and
emphasizing compliance at the initiation of treatment.
Children with persistent posttraumatic headaches may require frequent analgesics. Rebound headaches are common and can complicate
treatment. The excessive use of symptomatic headache medicines, most
commonly simple analgesics, can cause MOHs in susceptible patients
and has been well-­described in patients with primary headache disorders. Medication overuse can be a contributing factor in headache
chronicity in 20–30% of children and adolescents, with chronic daily
headache unrelated to concussion. Because analgesics are commonly
recommended for the treatment of acute headaches after concussion,
some susceptible patients with concussion are at risk for developing a
medication-­overuse pattern that causes a chronic headache syndrome.
There is no clear evidence to help guide the clinician on the timing of
initiation of preventive therapy in children to decrease the likelihood of
developing persistent posttraumatic headaches. Although many medications are being used to manage persistent posttraumatic headaches,
most have supporting data for the management of migraine or chronic
migraine, and few have been studied for the treatment of persistent
posttraumatic headaches in a systematic manner.
Sinus headache is the most overdiagnosed form of recurrent headache. Although no studies have evaluated the frequency of misdiagnosis of an underlying migraine as a sinus headache in children, in
adults, it has been found that up to 90% of adults diagnosed as having
a sinus headache either by themselves or their physician appear to have
migraine. When headaches are recurrent and respond within hours
to analgesics, migraine should be considered first. In the absence of
purulent nasal discharge, fever, or chronic cough, the diagnosis of sinus
headache should not be made.
MOHs frequently complicate primary and secondary headaches.
An MOH is defined as a headache present for more than 15 days/
month for longer than 3 months and intake of a simple analgesic on

more than 15 days/month and/or prescription medications, including
triptans or combination medications, on more than 10 days/month.
Some of the signs that should raise suspicion of medication overuse
are the increasing use of analgesics (nonprescription or prescription)
with either decreased effectiveness or frequent wearing off (i.e., analgesic rebound). An MOH can be worsened by ineffective medications
or misdiagnosis of the headache. Patients should be cautioned against
the frequent use of antimigraine medications, including combination
analgesics or triptans.
Serious causes of secondary headaches are likely to be related to
increased intracranial pressure. This can be caused by a mass (tumor,
vascular malformation, cystic structure) or an intrinsic increase in
pressure (idiopathic intracranial hypertension, also known as pseudotumor cerebri). In the former case, the headache is caused by the mass
effect and local pressure on the dura; in the latter case, the headache is
caused by diffuse pressure on the dura. The etiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension may be the intake of excessive amounts of fat-­
soluble compounds (e.g., vitamin A, retinoic acid, and minocycline),
hormonal changes (increased incidence in females), or blockage of

venous drainage (as with inflammation of the transverse venous sinus
from mastoiditis). When increased pressure is suspected, either by historical suspicion or the presence of papilledema, an MRI with magnetic
resonance angiography and magnetic resonance venography should
be performed, followed by a lumbar puncture if no mass or vascular
anomaly is noted. The lumbar puncture can be diagnostic and therapeutic of idiopathic intracranial hypertension but must be performed
with the patient in a relaxed recumbent position with legs extended,
because abdominal pressure can artificially raise intracranial pressure.
If headache persists or there are visual field changes, pharmaceutical
treatment with a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, optic nerve fenestration, or a shunt needs to be considered.
Additional causes of secondary headaches in children that may not
be associated with increased intracranial pressure include arteriovenous malformations, berry aneurysm, collagen vascular diseases
affecting the central nervous system, hypertensive encephalopathy,
infectious or autoimmune etiologies, acute subarachnoid hemorrhage,
and stroke. The management of secondary headache depends on the
cause. Helpful laboratory tests and neuroradiologic procedures depend
on the clues provided by the history (Table 635.11) and physical (Table
635.12) examination. By definition, a secondary headache has a specific cause and should resolve once this cause is treated. If the headache
persists, the diagnosis and treatment should be questioned because
either the diagnosis, which may include a primary headache, or the
treatment, or both, may be incorrect.

635.3 Tension-­Type Headaches
Andrew D. Hershey, Marielle Kabbouche, and
Joanne Kacperski
Tension-­type headaches (TTHs) may be common in children and adolescents, with a prevalence in some studies as high as 48%, with those
having a combination of migraine and TTH around 20%. Because of
their mild to moderate nature, relative lack of associated symptoms,
and lower degree of associated disability, they are often ignored or have
minimal impact. The ICHD-­3 subclassifies TTHs as infrequent (<12
headaches/year) (Table 635.13), frequent (1-­15 headaches/month), and
chronic (>15 headaches/month). They can further be separated into
headaches with or without pericranial muscle tenderness. The classification of TTH can be likened to the opposite of migraine. Whereas
migraines are typically moderate to severe, are focal in location, are
worsened by physical activity or limit physical activity, and have a
throbbing quality, TTHs are mild to moderate in severity, are diffuse
in location, are not affected by activity (although the patient may not
feel like being active), and are nonthrobbing (often described as a constant pressure). TTH is much less frequently associated with nausea,
photophobia, or phonophobia and is never associated with more than
one of these at a time or with vomiting. TTH must be recurrent, but at
least 10 headaches are required, and the duration can be 30 minutes to
7 days. Secondary headaches with other underlying etiologies must be
ruled out.
Evaluation of patients with suspected TTHs requires a detailed
headache history and complete general and neurologic examination.
This is to establish the diagnosis and ensure exclusion of secondary
etiologies. When secondary headaches are suspected, further directed
evaluation is indicated.
Treatment of TTHs can require acute therapy to stop attacks, preventive therapy when frequent or chronic, and behavioral therapy. It
is often suspected that there may be underlying psychologic stressors
(hence, the misnomer as a stress headache), but this is often difficult to
identify in children, and although it may be suspected by the parents,
it cannot be confirmed in the child. Studies of and conclusive evidence
to guide the treatment of TTH in children are lacking, but the same
general principles and medications used in migraine can be applied to
children with TTHs (see Chapter 635.1). Oftentimes, simple analgesics (ibuprofen or acetaminophen) can be effective for acute treatment.
Flupirtine is a nonopioid analgesic that has been approved in Europe
for the treatment of TTH in children as young as age 6 years but is
not available in the United States. Amitriptyline has the most evidence
of effective prevention of TTH; biobehavioral intervention, including
biofeedback-­assisted relaxation training and coping skills, can be useful as well.

Neurocutaneous
Syndromes
Mustafa Sahin, Nicole Ullrich,
Siddharth Srivastava, and Anna L. Pinto
The neurocutaneous syndromes include a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by abnormalities of both the integument and central nervous system (CNS) of variable severity (Table 636.1). Many of
the disorders are hereditary and believed to arise from a defect in differentiation of the primitive ectoderm (nervous system, eyeball, retina,
and skin). Disorders classified as neurocutaneous syndromes include
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2),
tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), Sturge-­Weber syndrome (SWS),
von Hippel-­Lindau disease (VHL), PHACE (posterior fossa malformations, hemangiomas, arterial anomalies, coarctation of the aorta,
cardiac defects, eye abnormalities) syndrome, ataxia-­
telangiectasia
(AT), linear nevus syndrome, hypomelanosis of Ito, and incontinentia
pigmenti.

636.1 Neurofibromatosis
Nicole Ullrich
NF refers to a group of autosomal dominant genetic conditions that
cause tumors to grown on nerves throughout the body. The types of
NF include neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and all types of schwannomatosis (SWN), including NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2-SWN,
formerly called neurofibromatosis type 2, or NF2).

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS

NF1 has an incidence of 1 in 2,500 live births and is caused by autosomal dominant loss-­of-­function pathogenic variants in the NF1 gene.
Approximately 50% are inherited from an affected parent, and the
other 50% result from a sporadic gene variant. The diagnostic criteria
for NF1 were updated in 2021 by an international expert panel. The
disease is clinically diagnosed when any two of the following manifestations are present: (1) Six or more café-­au-­lait macules (CALMs)
>5 mm in greatest diameter in prepubertal individuals and >15 mm
in greatest diameter in postpubertal individuals (Fig. 636.1). CALMs
are the hallmark of neurofibromatosis and are present in almost 100%
of patients. They are present at birth but increase in size, number, and
pigmentation, especially during the first few years of life. The CALMs
are scattered over the body surface, with predilection for the trunk and
extremities. CALMs are not specific for NF1 and may be observed in
other disorders (Table 636.2). (2) Axillary or inguinal freckling consisting of multiple hyperpigmented areas 2-­3 mm in diameter; at least
one of the two pigmentary findings (café-au-lait macules or freckling) must be bilateral (Fig. 636.2). Skinfold freckling usually appears
between 3 and 5 years of age. The frequency of axillary and inguinal
freckling is reported to be >80% by 6 years of age. (3) Two or more
iris Lisch nodules, which are hamartomas located within the iris and
are best identified by a slit-­lamp examination, or two or more choroidal abnormalities (Fig. 636.3). They are present in more than 74% of
patients with NF1. The prevalence of Lisch nodules increases with age,

Table 636.2  Diseases Associated with Multiple
Café-­Au-­Lait Macules

Fig. 636.1 Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The presence of six or

more café-­au-­lait (CAL) spots larger than 0.5 cm in diameter in children
and 1.5 cm in adolescents suggests the possibility of NF1, although
having CAL spots alone does not allow for definitive diagnosis. (From
Paller AS, Mancini AJ. Hurwitz Clinical Pediatric Dermatology, 5th ed.
Philadelphia: Elsevier; 2016, Fig. 11-­44.)

however, only ∼30% of these are clinically symptomatic and require
tumor-­directed therapy. They are the most frequently observed CNS
tumor in NF1. Because of visual acuity compromise, it is recommended that all children with NF1 undergo at least annual ophthalmologic examinations, or more frequent ones if there is a concern. The
most common time to develop symptoms is between the ages of 2 and
6 years; they manifest as a change in visual acuity, a change in the visual
fields, or pallor of the optic nerve. Extension into the hypothalamus
can lead to precocious puberty. The brain MRI findings of an optic
glioma include diffuse thickening, localized enlargement, or a distinct
focal mass originating from the optic nerve or chiasm (Fig. 636.4). (7)
A parent with NF1 whose diagnosis was based on the aforementioned
criteria. (8) A pathogenic NF1 gene variant. It is important to note that
genetic testing is not required to make a diagnosis of NF1, but it may
allow for an earlier diagnosis. In addition, presence of a genetic variant alone is not sufficient to diagnose NF1; a second diagnostic feature
is required.
Children with NF1 are susceptible to neurologic complications.
MRI studies of selected children have shown abnormal hyperintense
T2-­weighted signals in the optic tracts, brainstem, globus pallidus,
thalamus, internal capsule, and cerebellum (Fig. 636.5). These signals,
unidentified bright objects or focal areas of signal abnormality (FASI),
tend to disappear with age; most have disappeared by 30 years of age. It
is unclear what the unidentified bright objects represent pathologically,
and there is disagreement as to the relationship between the presence
and number of unidentified bright objects and the occurrence of learning disabilities, attention-­deficit disorders, behavioral and psychosocial
problems, and abnormalities of speech among affected children. Therefore imaging studies such as brain MRIs should be reserved for patients
with clinical symptoms only.
One of the most common complications is a learning disability affecting more than half of individuals with NF1. Seizures are
observed in approximately 8% of NF1 patients. The cerebral vessels may develop aneurysms or stenosis consistent with moyamoya
syndrome (see Chapter 641). Neurologic sequelae of these vascular
abnormalities include transient cerebrovascular ischemic attacks,
hemiparesis, and cognitive defects. Precocious puberty may become
evident in the presence or absence of lesions of the optic pathway
tumors. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are in the family
of aggressive sarcomas and occur either de novo or as the result of
malignant degeneration of an existing plexiform neurofibroma. The
lifetime risk is 8–13%. Additionally, the incidence of pheochromocytoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, leukemia, and Wilms tumor is higher
than in the general population. Scoliosis is a common complication
found in approximately 10% of the patients. Patients with NF1 are
at risk for hypertension, which may be present in isolation or result
from renal vascular stenosis or a pheochromocytoma.

Mosaic NF1 (also called segmental NF1) results from a pathogenic
variant that occurs after conception, leading to a mixture of cells with
and without the gene variant. The manifestations are therefore limited
to one or more body segments secondary to somatic (or gonadal) variants expressed in those locations. Lesions may be unilateral or bilateral,
asymmetric or symmetric, and confined to a narrow band or a single
quadrant. Neurologic manifestations are rare but have been reported.

Because of the diverse and unpredictable complications associated
with NF1, close multidisciplinary follow-­up is necessary. Patients with
NF1 should have regular clinical assessments at least yearly, focusing
the history and examination on the potential problems for which they
are at increased risk. These assessments include yearly ophthalmologic
examination, neurologic assessment, blood pressure monitoring, and
scoliosis evaluation. Neuropsychologic and educational testing should
be considered as needed. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Conference has advised against routine imaging
studies of the brain and optic tracts because treatment in these asymptomatic NF1 children is rarely required. However, all symptomatic
cases (i.e., those with changes in visual acuity, optic pallor, proptosis,
precocious puberty) should undergo MR imaging. Selumetinib, an oral
inhibitor of mitogen-­activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 1 and 2,
has been demonstrated in children (≥2 years of age) with NF1-­related
inoperable plexiform neurofibromas to be effective in inducing partial
responses and reducing tumor progression.

GENETIC COUNSELING

Fig. 636.4 Optic glioma. Sagittal T1-­weighted MRI scan of a patient
with NF1 shows thickening of the optic nerve (arrow).

Although NF1 is an autosomal dominant disorder, more than half
the cases are sporadic, representing de novo pathogenic variants.
The NF1 gene on chromosome region 17q11.2 encodes for a protein
also known as neurofibromin. Neurofibromin acts as an inhibitor
of the oncogene Ras (Fig. 636.6). The diagnosis of NF1 is based on
the clinical features; molecular testing for the NF1 gene variants is
available and now is included as one of the diagnostic criteria. Some
scenarios in which genetic testing is particularly helpful include
patients who meet only one of the criteria for clinical diagnosis,
those with unusually severe disease, and those seeking prenatal/
preimplantation diagnosis.
An international consensus group of NF experts updated the diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis type 2 and schwannomatosis (SWN).
SWN is the umbrella term used to describe the group of overlapping
conditions in which a patient has multiple schwannomas. The criteria
also address the discovery of the genes involved, assists in distinguishing
the types of neurofibromatosis and SWN using classification according to

the pathogenic variant identified, and minimizes the misdiagnosis with
NF1. Genetic testing for the variants involved in all subtypes of SWN is
available and should be completed whenever possible for a patient suspected of having this diagnosis. This can be performed on a blood or saliva
sample, but often requires tumor tissue. There are several key updates to
the former NF2 diagnostic criteria: NF2 pathologic variant added; clarification of first-­degree relative with “other than sibling”; cataract clarified
as juvenile cataract; retinal hamartoma added as a criterion; glioma and
neurofibroma removed; and ependymoma added (Table 636.3).
Genetic testing identifies pathogenic variants in the NF2 gene in
66-­
90% of individuals with NF2-­schwannomatosis (NF2-­SWN),
which has an incidence of 1:25,000 worldwide. The NF2 gene (which
codes for a protein known as merlin or schwannomin) is located on
chromosome 22q1.11. Table 636.4 notes the frequency of lesions in
NF2. Testing is not required for the diagnosis and it remains possible to diagnose NF2-­SWN based on clinical criteria. Genetic testing
is required for the diagnosis of a specific type of schwannomatosis
(except NF2-­related or NOS). Excluding NF2-­SWN, the other types
of SWN affect 1:70,000 individuals. Genetic testing alone is not sufficient to make a diagnosis and there must also be a clinical feature.
In most cases, tissue from schwannoma or hybrid nerve sheath tumor
is required to diagnose the type of SWN and to distinguish between
LZTR1-­related SWN, SMARCB1-­related SWN, 22q-­related SWN and
SWN NOS/NEC.
Individuals with NF2-­SWN may present with tinnitus, hearing loss,
facial weakness, headache, and gait instability. Although this may present in childhood, VS are more likely to appear in the second and third
decades of life. In the pediatric age group, café au lait macules and cutaneous plexiform schwannomas are the most common presentation and
can be confused with the skin findings in NF1.
Workup should include ophthalmologic evaluation (assessing
for subcapsular or cortical cataracts), MRI of the brain and spine,
and audiology evaluation. These are all important components of
ongoing surveillance and management of individuals with suspected or confirmed NF2-­related SWN. The goal is to preserve
hearing related to VS. Other forms of SWN should be suspected
when an individual has two or more schwannomas in the absence

636.2 Tuberous Sclerosis
Siddharth Srivastava and Mustafa Sahin
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem disease characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, variable expressivity, and a prevalence of 1 in 6,000-­10,000 newborns. Spontaneous
pathogenic variants occur in 65% of the cases. Molecular genetic studies have identified two foci for TSC: the TSC1 gene (located on chromosome 9q34) and the TSC2 gene (located on chromosome 16p13).
The TSC1 gene encodes a protein called hamartin, and the TSC2 gene
encodes a protein called tuberin. Within a cell, these two molecules
form a complex along with a third protein, TBC1D7 (Tre2-­Bub2-­
Cdc16 1 domain family, member 7). Consequently, a pathogenic variant in either the TSC1 gene or the TSC2 gene results in a similar disease
in patients, though individuals with TSC2 variants tend to be more
severely affected.
Tuberin and hamartin are involved in a key pathway in the cell that
regulates protein synthesis and cell size (see Fig. 636.6). One of the ways

3657

cells regulate their growth is by controlling the rate of protein synthesis. A protein called mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is one of
the master regulators of cell growth (mTOR has additional roles in the
CNS, where it helps regulate neuronal development and synaptic plasticity). mTOR, in turn, is controlled by Ras homolog enriched in brain
(RHEB), a small cytoplasmic guanosine triphosphatase. When RHEB
is activated, the protein synthesis machinery is turned on, most likely
via mTOR signaling, and the cell grows. Under normal conditions, the
tuberin/hamartin complex keeps RHEB in an inactive state. However,
in TSC, there is disinhibition of RHEB and subsequent overactivation
of the mTOR pathway. Accordingly, the TSC1 and TSC2 genes can
be considered tumor-­suppressor genes. The loss of either tuberin or
hamartin protein results in the formation of numerous benign tumors
(hamartomas).
TSC is an extremely heterogeneous disease with a wide clinical
spectrum varying from severe intellectual disability and intractable
epilepsy to normal intelligence and a lack of seizures. This variation
is often seen within the same family, that is, with individuals within a
family carrying the same variant. The disease affects many organ systems other than the skin and brain, including the heart, kidney, eyes,
lungs, and bone (Fig. 636.7).

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS

Definite TSC is diagnosed when at least two major or one major
plus two minor features are present (Tables 636.5 and 636.6 list the
major and minor features). In addition, carrying a pathogenic variant in TSC1 or TSC2 is sufficient for the diagnosis of TSC.
The hallmark of TSC is the involvement of the CNS. The characteristic brain lesion is a cortical tuber (Fig. 636.8). Brain MRI is the
best way of identifying cortical tubers, which can form before birth.
Subependymal nodules are lesions found along the wall of the lateral
ventricles, where they undergo calcification and project into the ventricular cavity, producing a candle-­dripping appearance. These lesions
do not cause any problems; however, in 5–10% of cases, these benign
lesions can grow into subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs).
These tumors can grow and block the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid
around the brain and cause hydrocephalus, which requires immediate
neurosurgical intervention. Thus it is recommended that all asymptomatic TSC patients undergo brain MRI every 1-­3 years to monitor for new
occurrences of SEGA. Patients with large or growing SEGAs, or with
SEGAs causing ventricular enlargement without other manifestations,
should undergo MRI scans more frequently, and the patients and their
families should be educated regarding the potential of new symptoms
caused by increased intracranial pressure. Surgical resection should be
performed for acutely symptomatic SEGA. For growing but otherwise
asymptomatic SEGAs, either surgical resection or medical treatment
with an mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus, everolimus) may be used. Treatment with everolimus can be effective in slowing the growth or even
reducing the size of SEGAs. Everolimus is also effective in treating renal
angiomyolipomas. Sirolimus is also effective in treating lymphangioleiomyomatosis, renal angiomyolipomas, and cardiac rhabdomyomas.
The most common neurologic manifestations of TSC are epilepsy,
intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder. TSC may present during infancy with infantile spasms and a hypsarrhythmic electroencephalogram pattern. However, it is important to remember
that TSC patients can have infantile spasms without hypsarrhythmia. The seizures may be difficult to control, and at a later age, they
may develop into other seizure types such as focal-­onset seizures or
generalized myoclonic seizures (see Chapter 633). Vigabatrin is the
first-­line therapy for infantile spasms. Adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH) or prednisolone can be used if treatment with vigabatrin
fails. Anticonvulsant therapy for other seizure types in TSC should
generally follow that of other epilepsies, and epilepsy surgery can be
considered for medically refractory TSC patients. Everolimus (adjunctive) has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval
for treatment-­refractory focal seizures in TSC. Studies on prevention
of epilepsy with preemptive treatment with vigabatrin have yielded
mixed results so far. However, it is recommended that infants with TSC
should undergo baseline EEG to enable early detection and treatment

of age. In addition to epilepsy, about 90% of individuals with TSC have
a spectrum of cognitive, behavioral, psychiatric, and academic impairments termed tuberous sclerosis–associated neuropsychiatric disorders
(TANDs), which include intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and depression.
About 45% of individuals with TSC have intellectual disability, and up
to 25-50% have autism spectrum disorder.

Skin Lesions

More than 90% of patients show the typical hypomelanotic macules
that have been likened to an ash leaf on the trunk and extremities.

Visualization of the hypomelanotic macule is enhanced by using a Wood
ultraviolet lamp (see Chapter 694). To count as a major feature, at least
three hypomelanotic macules must be present (see Fig. 636.7). Facial
angiofibromas develop between 4 and 6 years of age; they appear as tiny
red nodules over the nose and cheeks and are sometimes confused with
acne (see Fig. 636.7). Later, they enlarge, coalesce, and assume a fleshy
appearance. Topical rapamycin is approved for treatment of facial angiofibromas. A shagreen patch is also characteristic of TSC and consists
of a roughened, raised lesion with an orange-­peel consistency located
primarily in the lumbosacral region (see Fig. 636.7). Forehead fibrous
plaques usually occur on one side of the forehead. They are characteristically raised, yellow-­brown or flesh-­colored, and soft to hard in
consistency. Forehead plaques are histologically similar to facial angiofibromas, though the former can appear at any point. During adolescence
or later, small fibromas or nodules of skin may form around fingernails
or toenails (ungual fibromas) in 15–20% of TSC patients (Fig. 636.9).

Diagnosis of TSC relies on a high index of suspicion, especially
when assessing a child with infantile spasms. A careful evaluation for
the typical skin and retinal lesions should be completed in all patients
with a seizure disorder or autism spectrum disorder. Brain MRI can
confirm the clinical diagnosis in many cases. Genetic testing for pathogenic TSC1 and TSC2 variants is available and should be considered
when the individual patient does not meet all the clinical criteria, or in
order to provide molecular confirmation of a clinical diagnosis. Prenatal testing may be offered when a known pathogenic TSC1/TSC2 variant exists in that family.

MANAGEMENT

Fig. 636.9 Periungual fibroma in a patient with tuberous sclerosis
complex (TSC).

The following are recommended for routine follow-­up of individuals
with TSC in addition to physical examination: brain MRI every 1-­3
years, abdominal MRI to evaluate the kidneys every 1-­3 years; echocardiogram every 1-­3 years in patients with cardiac rhabdomyomas until
there is regression of the rhabdomyomas; electrocardiogram every 3-­5
years; high-­resolution chest CT every 5-­10 years in females older than
18 years; dental examination twice a year; skin examinations once a year;
detailed ophthalmic examination once a year in patients with vision concerns or retinal lesions (sooner if they are receiving treatment with vigabatrin); neurodevelopmental testing at the beginning of first grade or
sooner based on concerns; and screening for TAND at each clinic visit.
Based on the complications of the disease, additional follow-­up testing
may be required for each individual. Symptoms and signs of increased
intracranial pressure suggest obstruction of the foramen of Monro by a
SEGA and warrant immediate investigation and surgical intervention.

nerve in a patient with tuberous sclerosis. (From Yanoff M, Sassani JW.
Ocular Pathology, 7th ed. Philadelphia: WB Saunders; 2015: Fig. 2-­7.)

Other Organ Involvement

Retinal lesions consist of two types: hamartomas (elevated mulberry
lesions or plaquelike lesions (Fig. 636.10) and white depigmented
patches (similar to the hypopigmented skin lesions). Approximately
50% of children with TSC have cardiac rhabdomyomas, which may be
detected in the fetus by an echocardiogram, usually by 20-­30 weeks of
gestation. The rhabdomyomas may be numerous and located throughout the ventricular myocardium, and although they can cause congestive heart failure and arrhythmias in a minority of patients, they tend to
slowly resolve spontaneously. In 75–80% of patients older than 10 years
of age, the kidneys display angiomyolipomas that are usually benign
tumors. Angiomyolipomas begin in childhood in many individuals
with TSC, but they may not be problematic until young adulthood. By
the third decade of life, they may cause lumbar pain and hematuria
from slow bleeding, and rarely they may result in sudden retroperitoneal bleeding. Embolization followed by corticosteroids to alleviate
postembolization syndrome is first-­line therapy for angiomyolipoma
presenting with acute hemorrhage. Nephrectomy should be avoided as
a way of maintaining renal function, because lesions can be numerous
and bilateral. For asymptomatic, growing angiomyolipomas measuring larger than 3 cm in diameter, an mTOR inhibitor, everolimus, is
approved for treatment by the FDA. Selective embolization or kidney-­
sparing resection is an alternative therapy for asymptomatic angiomyolipoma. Single or multiple renal cysts are also commonly present
in TSC; renal cell carcinoma, on the other hand, is rare. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is the classic pulmonary lesion in TSC and only
affects women, beginning in late adolescence (≥15 years). Sirolimus is
approved by the FDA for lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Topical rapamycin should be considered for treatment of facial angiofibromas.

Sturge-­Weber syndrome (SWS) is a segmental vascular neurocutaneous disorder with a constellation of symptoms and signs characterized
by capillary malformation in the face (port-­wine birthmark [PWB])
and brain (leptomeninges), as well as abnormal blood vessels of the eye
leading to glaucoma. Low flow of the leptomeningeal capillary malformation appears to result in a chronic hypoxic state leading to cortical
atrophy and calcifications. Patients present with seizures, hemiparesis,
strokelike episodes, headaches, and developmental delay. Approximately 1 in 20,000-­50,000 live births are affected with SWS.

ETIOLOGY

The nonsyndromic PWBs and SWS are caused by a pathologic somatic
single-­nucleotide variant (c.548G→A, p.Arg183Gln) in the GNAQ gene
(see Fig. 636.6). Brain tissue from SWS patients also demonstrates the
same change in the GNAQ gene. These results strongly suggest that
SWS occurs as a result of a mosaic pathologic genetic variant in GNAQ.
The GNAQ p.R183Q variant is enriched in endothelial cells in SWS
brain lesions, thereby revealing endothelial cells as a source of aberrant Gαq signaling. The timing of the somatic variant in GNAQ during
development likely affects the clinical phenotype. Mosaic-­activating
GNA11 and GNB2 gene variants have been described in atypical SWS
cases. The aberrant G-­protein signaling provides a molecular basis to
explain SWS lesions.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Facial PWBs are present at birth, but not all are associated with SWS
(Table 636.7). In fact, the overall incidence of SWS has been reported
to be 20–40% in those with a PWB involving the forehead and upper
eyelid. High-­risk PWB for SWS includes hemifacial, median, and forehead phenotypes (Fig. 636.11), along with large segmental PWB. The
PWB tends to be unilateral and ipsilateral to the brain involvement
(Fig. 636.12). The capillary malformation may also be evident over
the lower face and trunk and in the mucosa of the mouth and pharynx. Buphthalmos and glaucoma of the ipsilateral eye are common

complications. Seizures occur in 75–80% of all SWS patients and in
over 90% of those with bilateral brain involvement. Early onset of
seizures will likely occur during the first year of life but rarely during
the first month of life, and they are typically focal clonic and contralateral to the side of the facial PWB. They may become refractory to
anticonvulsants, and status epilepticus is often associated. One third
of children with intractable epilepsy associated with SWS experience
episodes of prolonged postictal deficits, which would last from 1 day
to a few years, until recovering back to baseline. Some patients also
develop slowly progressive hemiparesis. Transient strokelike episodes or visual field defects persisting for several days and unrelated
to seizure activity are common and probably result from thrombosis
of cortical veins in the affected region. Although neurodevelopment
appears to be normal in the first year of life, intellectual disability

show leptomeningeal enhancement in the left hemisphere.

or severe learning disabilities are present in at least 50% of patients
in later childhood, probably the result of intractable epilepsy and
increasing cerebral atrophy. The degree of visual field defect, hemiparesis, seizure frequency, and cognitive function (based on age-­group:
infant/preschooler, child, and adult) can be rated using a validated
SWS neurologic rating system.

DIAGNOSIS

Brain MRI with contrast is the imaging modality of choice for demonstrating the extension of pial capillary malformation in SWS (Fig.
636.13). White matter abnormalities are common and are thought to
be a result of chronic hypoxia. Often, atrophy is noted ipsilateral to
the leptomeningeal capillary malformation. Calcifications can be seen
best with a head CT (Fig. 636.14). The choroid plexus is frequently
enlarged, and the degree of plexal enlargement shows a positive correlation with the extent of the leptomeningeal capillary malformation.
Positron emission tomography using 18 F-­deoxyglucose has been used
to study cerebral metabolism in patients with SWS, and it has been
useful for the surgical planning and prognosis. Ophthalmologic evaluation examining for glaucoma is also necessary and is a lifelong concern because ocular complications can occur at any moment during a
lifetime. Based on the involvement of the brain and the face, there are
three types of SWS in the Roach Scale:

Chapter 636 u Neurocutaneous Syndromes

Fig. 636.14 CT scan of a patient with Sturge-­Weber syndrome showing
unilateral calcification and underlying atrophy of a cerebral hemisphere.

Type I: Classic facial and leptomeningeal capillary malformation
present; often with glaucoma.
Type II: Facial capillary malformation alone (no CNS involvement);
may have glaucoma.
Type III: Isolated leptomeningeal capillary malformation; usually no
glaucoma.
In addition, there is an overlap syndrome between SWS and Klippel-­
Trénaunay syndrome (mixed capillary, venous, or lymphatic malformations involving bone and muscle in one limb).

MANAGEMENT

The management of SWS is primarily symptomatic and multidisciplinary
but not well studied by prospective studies. Treatment is aimed at seizure
control, relief of headaches, and prevention of strokelike episodes, as well
as monitoring of glaucoma and laser therapy for the cutaneous capillary
malformations. Most infants with SWS brain involvement have seizure
onset by 2 years of age. Presymptomatic treatment in high-risk babies
may prevent or delay seizure onset. For patients with well-­controlled seizures and normal or near-­normal development, management consists of
anticonvulsants and surveillance for complications, including glaucoma
and behavioral abnormalities. If the seizures are refractory to anticonvulsant therapy, especially in infancy and the first 1-­2 years and arise from
primarily one hemisphere, most medical centers advise a hemispherectomy or, if well indicated, focal disconnections. The use of low-­dose aspirin is controversial. The medication is not used routinely, but patients
with strokelike events and frequent refractory seizures may benefit from
this form of treatment. Because of the risk of glaucoma, regular measurement of intraocular pressure is indicated. The facial PWB is often a target of ridicule by classmates, leading to psychologic trauma. Pulsed-­dye
laser therapy often provides excellent clearing of the PWB, particularly if
it is located on the forehead.

636.4 Von Hippel-­Lindau Disease
Siddharth Srivastava and Mustafa Sahin
von Hippel-­Lindau disease affects many organs, including the cerebellum, spinal cord, retina, endolymphatic sac of the inner ear, kidney, pancreas, adrenal glands, epididymis, and broad ligament of the

3661

uterus. Its incidence is around 1 in 36,000 newborns. It results from
an autosomal dominant pathogenic variant affecting a tumor suppressor gene, VHL. Approximately 80% of affected individuals have
an inherited variant, and approximately 20% have a de novo variant.
Molecular testing is available and detects pathogenic variants in most
probands.
The major neurologic feature of the condition is CNS hemangioblastomas, including brain hemangioblastomas and spinal hemangioblastomas. In affected individuals, brain hemangioblastomas commonly
affect the cerebellum. Patients with cerebellar hemangioblastoma
can present in early adult life with symptoms and signs of increased
intracranial pressure. A brain CT or MRI scan typically shows a cystic
cerebellar lesion with a vascular mural nodule. A smaller number of
patients have hemangioblastoma of the spinal cord, producing pain as
well as sensory and motor changes. Syringomyelia often accompanies
symptomatic spinal hemangioblastomas in von Hippel-­Lindau disease.
Surgical intervention for symptomatic CNS hemangioblastomas and
syringomyelia is often warranted.
Approximately 70% of individuals with von Hippel-­Lindau disease
have retinal angiomas (also known as retinal hemangioblastomas),
which have identical histology as CNS hemangioblastomas. Retinal
angiomas, which can present in childhood, are characterized by small
masses of thin-­walled capillaries that are fed by large and tortuous arterioles and venules. They are usually located in the peripheral retina so
that vision is unaffected. Exudation in the region of the angiomas may
lead to retinal detachment and visual loss. Retinal angiomas are treated
with photocoagulation and cryocoagulation, though outcomes can
vary depending on the characteristics of the lesions, and complications
such as retinal edema can occur.
Cysts (affecting the kidneys, pancreas, and liver), as well as tumors/
malignancies (including endolymphatic sac tumors, pheochromocytoma, paragangliomas, neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas,
renal cell carcinomas, epididymis cystadenomas, and broad ligament
cystadenomas) are associated with von Hippel-­Lindau disease. Renal
carcinoma and CNS hemangioblastomas can be causes of death in
affected individuals. Regular follow-­up and appropriate imaging studies are necessary to identify lesions that may be treated at an early stage.
In affected individuals ≥1 year, there should be yearly ophthalmology
evaluation for retinal angiomas. Beginning in the first decade of life,
there should be yearly clinical assessment for neurological concerns,
vision concerns, and hearing concerns, as well as measurement of
blood pressure. At age 5 years, laboratory screening for pheochromocytoma should begin. Beginning at age 11 years, there should be brain
and complete spine MRI every 2 years to evaluate for CNS lesions, with
particular focus on the inner/petrous temporal bone and posterior
fossa. Beginning at age 11 years, there should also be formal audiology
assessment every 2-3 years to screen for endolymphatic sac tumors.
Formal audiological assessment should occur sooner and more frequently if symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo are
present. Beginning at age 15 years, there should be MRI of the abdomen (including kidney, pancreas, and adrenal glands) every 2 years to
evaluate for visceral lesions. At age 15-20 years in asymptomatic individuals, there should be an MRI of internal auditory canals to screen
for endolymphatic sac tumor.

636.5 Linear Nevus Sebaceous Syndrome
Siddharth Srivastava and Mustafa Sahin
This sporadic condition is characterized by a large facial nevus, neurodevelopmental abnormalities, and systemic defects. The nevus is usually located on the forehead and nose and tends to be midline in its
distribution, although it may affect other locations, such as the scalp
and neck. It may be quite faint during infancy but later becomes hyperkeratotic, with a yellow-­brown appearance.
The most common associated CNS finding is unilateral hemimegalencephaly (enlargement of one cerebral hemisphere), which affects

about half of patients. Other structural brain abnormalities include
enlargement of the lateral ventricles, white matter hyperintensity on
T2-­weighted imaging, cortical dysplasia, pachygyria, agyria, agenesis
of the corpus callosum, and Dandy-­Walker malformation. The incidence of epilepsy and intellectual disability is as high as 75% and 60%,
respectively. Focal neurologic signs, including hemiparesis and homonymous hemianopia, may occur.
Other organ systems may be involved, including the eyes (strabismus, retinal abnormalities, coloboma, cataracts, corneal revascularization, ocular hemangiomas, and lipodermoid scleral tumors); heart
(aortic coarctation, ventricular septal defect); kidneys (horseshoe kidney); and skeleton (fibrous dysplasia, skeletal hypoplasia, scoliosis/
kyphoscoliosis, and vitamin D-­resistant hypophosphatemic rickets).
The syndrome is associated with somatic variants in members of
the Ras family of oncogenes, including HRAS (HRas proto-­oncogene,
GTPase), KRAS (KRAS proto-­oncogene, GTPase), and NRAS (neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog) (see Fig. 636.6).

636.6 PHACE Syndrome
Siddharth Srivastava and Mustafa Sahin
See also Chapter 691.
The syndrome denotes posterior fossa malformations, hemangiomas, arterial anomalies, coarctation of the aorta and other cardiac
defects, and eye abnormalities (see Chapter 691). It is also referred to
as PHACES syndrome when ventral developmental defects, including sternal clefting and/or a supraumbilical raphe, are present. The
hallmark of the disorder is infantile hemangiomas affecting the face,
neck, and/or scalp. The underlying pathogenesis of PHACE syndrome
remains unknown, though evidence that infantile hemangiomas may
result from abnormal growth and differentiation of hemogenic endothelium highlights some avenues for further investigation. Overall,
there is a female predominance, but the reasons for this association
are unclear.
Other organ systems besides the skin are commonly affected in
PHACE syndrome. Posterior fossa anomalies affect up to 80% of
patients and encompass Dandy-­Walker malformation and cerebellar hypoplasia/dysplasia. Less common structural brain anomalies
include neuronal migration defects (polymicrogyria, heterotopia,
cortical dysplasia), dysgenesis of the corpus callosum or septum pellucidum, and pituitary defects. Congenital heart disease affects up to two
thirds of patients, and common defects are aortic anomalies (coarctation of aorta, dysplasia of aortic arch) and aberrant left subclavian
artery. The facial hemangioma is typically ipsilateral to the aortic arch
anomalies. Arterial anomalies include hypoplasia/dysplasia/altered
anatomic course of cervical, cerebral, and brachiocephalic arteries.
Cerebrovascular anomalies can result in progressive arterial stenosis
and acute ischemic stroke. Ophthalmologic findings include persistent
fetal vasculature (also known as persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous), retinal vascular anomalies, morning glory disc anomaly, optic
nerve hypoplasia, peripapillary staphyloma, coloboma, cataracts, and
microphthalmia. Endocrinopathies (such as hypopituitarism, hypogonadism, hypothyroidism, ectopic thyroid gland, growth hormone deficiency, and diabetes insipidus) can occur. Midline defects of the chest
and abdomen encompass sternal defect, sternal pit, sternal cleft, and
supraumbilical raphe. Dental abnormalities, specifically enamel hypoplasia, can be associated with PHACE syndrome.
There can be an assortment of neurologic symptoms, the most common of which is headaches, specifically migraines. Other reported neurologic symptoms are seizures, cyclical vomiting, developmental delay
(language, gross motor, fine motor), hypotonia, tremor, dysphagia,
opisthotonus, hearing loss (conductive, sensorineural, or mixed), and
cranial nerve deficits. New onset of headaches in an individual with
PHACE syndrome should prompt further evaluation for vessel disease
and cerebral ischemia. Development can be affected: according to a

case series of 29 children with PHACE syndrome, 69% had abnormal
neurodevelopment, including 44% with language delay, 36% with gross
motor delay, and 8% with fine motor delay. Certain medical comorbidities like posterior fossa malformations and oropharyngeal hemangiomas increase the risk for dysphagia. Sensorineural hearing loss may be
caused by involvement of the cranial nerve VIII that is on the same side
as the infantile hemangioma; similarly, conductive hearing loss may be
caused by compression of the eustachian tube that is on the same side
as the infantile hemangioma.
There are clinical diagnostic criteria for PHACE syndrome that
delineate definite PHACE syndrome and possible PHACE syndrome.
Definite PHACE syndrome is defined by either of the following: (1)
infantile hemangioma (>5 cm in diameter) affecting the head/scalp in
combination with one major or two minor criteria or (2) segmental
infantile hemangioma of the neck, upper trunk, or trunk/proximal arm
in combination with two major criteria. Possible PHACE syndrome is
defined by one of the following: (1) infantile hemangioma (>5 cm in
diameter) affecting the head/scalp in combination with one minor criteria; (2) segmental infantile hemangioma of the neck, upper trunk,
or trunk/proximal arm in combination with one major or two minor
criteria; and (3) absence of hemangioma but presence of two major
criteria. Major and minor criteria pertain to arterial, structural brain,
cardiovascular, ocular, and ventral/midline features of the syndrome.
Children newly diagnosed with PHACE syndrome should undergo
a complete physical examination, screening echocardiogram, ophthalmologic examination, hearing screening, and MRI with and
without gadolinium of the brain/neck as well as MRA of the brain/
neck/aortic arch. Results of these baseline evaluations steer further
management. The presence of a severe midline defect would prompt
evaluation with pediatric surgery. Abnormalities on echocardiogram
would require expertise from pediatric cardiology. Anomalies on
ophthalmologic exam would likely require ongoing care. Hearing loss
can be a risk factor for language delay, so affected children should
have hearing screening if not already performed. If there are structural brain abnormalities identified on MRI, evaluation by pediatric
neurology and neurosurgery (in the case of Dandy-­Walker malformation or hydrocephalus) would be necessary. Pituitary defects would
require endocrinologic evaluation. Results from MRA of cervical and
cerebral arteries would classify patients into one of three risk tiers for
cerebrovascular changes and stroke (low risk, intermediate risk, high
risk), each with varying levels of need for follow-­up neuroimaging and
ongoing neurologic care.
Treatments in PHACE syndrome are symptom targeted. The β
blocker propranolol can be used for infantile hemangiomas associated with PHACE syndrome, though there must be careful consideration in the presence of cerebrovascular abnormalities predisposing to
stroke. Treatment of headaches is per standard clinical care, but certain
vasoconstrictive medications, like triptans and ergotamine derivatives,
should be avoided if there are arterial abnormalities. Dysphagia would
require referral for feeding evaluation. Developmental delays should
prompt neurodevelopmental assessment and developmental therapies
such as physical therapy and speech-­language therapy.
LUMBAR syndrome (lower-­segment hemangioma, urogenital
defects, myelopathy of spinal cord, bony deformities, arterial and
anorectal defects, renal anomalies), also called SACRAL syndrome
(spinal dysraphism, anogenital anomalies, cutaneous anomalies, renal-­
urologic anomalies, angioma of lumbosacral localization), is a possible
variant of PHACES syndrome in the lumbosacral region.

Chapter 636 u Neurocutaneous Syndromes
dominant gene IKBKG (previously NEMO), which plays a role in activating the antiapoptotic signaling molecule NF-­kappaB (NF-­κB). In
the majority of males, IP causes embryonic lethality, so affected males
who survive have somatic mosaicism for a pathogenic IKBKG variant or
a 47,XXY karyotype. With respect to a male with IP, some of his daughters may inherit a pathogenic IKBKG variant and hence be affected, but
all of his sons would be unaffected. Among affected females, an abnormal gene product causes apoptosis in cells; therefore highly skewed
X-­inactivation can be a result. With respect to a female with IP, one
third of her offspring are expected to be unaffected females, one third
are expected to be affected females, and one third are expected to be
unaffected males; this ratio accounts for the high rate of miscarriages
in pregnancies with a male conceptus carrying a pathogenic variant in
IKBKG.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS

This disease has four stages, not all of which may occur in a given
patient. The first (bullous) stage is evident at birth or in the first few
weeks of life and consists of erythematous linear streaks and plaques
of vesicles (Fig. 636.15) that are most pronounced on the limbs and
circumferentially on the trunk. The lesions may be confused with
those of herpes simplex, bullous impetigo, or mastocytosis, but the
linear configuration is unique. Histopathologically, epidermal edema
and eosinophil-­filled intraepidermal vesicles are present. Eosinophils
also infiltrate the adjacent epidermis and dermis. Blood eosinophilia
as high as 65% of the white blood cell count is common. The first stage
generally resolves by 4 months of age, but mild, short-­lived recurrences
of blisters may develop during febrile illnesses. In the second (verrucous) stage, as blisters on the distal limbs resolve, they become dry
and hyperkeratotic, forming verrucous plaques. The verrucous plaques
rarely affect the trunk or face and generally involute within 6 months.
Epidermal hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, dyskeratosis, and papillomatosis are characteristic. The third (pigmentary) stage is the hallmark of
IP. It generally develops over weeks to months and may overlap the earlier phases or, more commonly, begin to appear in the first few months
of life. Hyperpigmentation is more often apparent on the trunk than the
limbs and is distributed in macular whorls, reticulated patches, flecks,
and linear streaks that follow Blaschko lines. The axillae and groin are
characteristically affected. The sites of involvement are not necessarily those of the preceding vesicular and warty lesions. The pigmented
lesions, once present, persist throughout childhood. They generally
begin to fade by early adolescence and often disappear by age 16 years.
Occasionally, the pigmentation remains permanently, particularly in
the groin. Histopathologically, the lesion shows vacuolar degeneration
of the epidermal basal cells and melanin in melanophages of the upper
dermis as a result of incontinence of pigment. In the fourth (atretic)
stage, hairless, anhidrotic, hypopigmented patches or streaks occur as
a late manifestation of IP; they may develop, however, before the hyperpigmentation of stage 3 has resolved. The lesions develop mainly on the
flexor aspect of the lower legs and less often on the arms and trunk. On

histology, there are decreased rete ridges (epidermal protrusions) and
sweat gland secretory coils during this stage.
A large percentage of affected children have other dermal/dental
defects. Alopecia, which may be scarring and patchy or diffuse, is most
common on the vertex and occurs in up to 40% of patients. Hair may
be coarse and wooly or sparse and brittle. Fingernails and toenails may
demonstrate pigmentary or dystrophic changes (ridging, pitting), as
well as painful subungual and periungual keratotic tumors. Dental
anomalies consist of late dentition, hypodontia, conical teeth, malocclusion, and impaction.
CNS manifestations are found in up to 30% of affected children and
include seizures, intellectual disability, learning disabilities, microcephaly, hemiplegia/hemiparesis (in the setting of stroke), spasticity, and cerebellar ataxia. Brain MRI in patients can be notable for periventricular
and subcortical white matter changes, ischemic/hemorrhagic infarcts,
hemorrhagic necrosis, dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebral atrophy, cerebellar hypoplasia, cystic changes, and ventricular enlargement.
Ocular anomalies, such as retinal neovascularization, microphthalmos, strabismus, optic nerve atrophy, cataracts, and retrolenticular
masses, occur in up to 77% of affected individuals. Nonetheless, >90%
of patients have normal vision. Notably, retinal neovascularization
could herald abnormalities in the CNS vasculature that predispose the
patient to ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.
Other medical issues have been reported in IP. Leukocytosis with
eosinophilia can occur. Primary pulmonary hypertension is seen in
some affected individuals.
Diagnosis of IP is made on clinical grounds, although major and
minor criteria have been established to aid in the diagnosis. Satisfaction of the sole major criteria (pertaining to the characteristic skin
lesions in the varying stages) is needed for a clinical diagnosis; lack
of fulfillment of any of the minor criteria may direct the clinician
toward the possibility of another diagnosis. Wood lamp examination
may be useful in older children and adolescents to highlight pigmentary abnormalities. Clinical molecular testing is available, and around
65% of affected females and 16% of affected males have a recurrent
pathogenic variant, an 11.7-­kb deletion of exons 4-­10 of IKBKG. Skin
biopsy may be helpful if the patient has unclear clinical findings and
negative genetic testing. For male patients with negative genetic testing
from blood, a variant may be detectable in skin cells from an affected
region, increasing the utility of a skin biopsy. The differential diagnosis
includes hypomelanosis of Ito, which presents with similar skin manifestations and is often associated with chromosomal mosaicism.

MANAGEMENT

The choice of investigative studies and the plan of management depend
on the occurrence of particular noncutaneous abnormalities. Medical
genetics and genetic counseling can help establish a molecular diagnosis in addition to providing family counseling. Dermatology may be
involved to characterize the nature of skin lesions and to manage skin
manifestations that are extensive. Dentistry can provide teeth implants
along with routine care. If dental issues affect speech or feeding, then
input from speech pathologists and nutritionists may be necessary.
Ophthalmology is important for delineating the presence and extent
of retinal neovascularization (which can be treated with cryotherapy
and laser photocoagulation) and other ocular abnormalities. Cardiology may be necessary if there is pulmonary hypertension. Neurology
can help evaluate and treat relevant concerns such as microcephaly, seizures, and motor abnormalities. A brain MRI is useful if there are focal
neurologic deficits or retinal neovascularization. Finally, developmental medicine can formulate recommendations regarding developmental
and behavioral concerns. Surveillance includes regular ophthalmologic
assessment (monthly until age 4 months, then every 3 months until age
1 year, then every 6 months until age 3 years, then annually thereafter).
Regular evaluation with dentistry and neurologic/neurodevelopmental
assessments are appropriate.

Movement Disorders
Jonathan W. Mink
INTRODUCTION

Movement disorders are characterized by impaired voluntary movements or excessive involuntary movements that may result in
abnormalities in posture, tone, balance, or fine motor control. Most
movement disorders in children are characterized by involuntary
movements. These involuntary movements can represent the sole disease manifestation, or they may be one of many signs and symptoms.
Evaluation of movement disorders begins with a comprehensive
history and careful neurologic examination. It is often difficult for
children and caregivers to describe abnormal movements, which
makes observation of the movements by the clinician an essential
component of the evaluation. If the movements are not apparent at
the time of the examination, video examples from home or school can
be invaluable.
There is no specific diagnostic test to differentiate among movement
disorders. The category of movement assists in localizing the pathologic process, whereas the onset of the disorder, age of the patient, and
degree of abnormal motor activity and associated neurologic findings
help organize the investigation.
When considering the type of movement disorder, the following
questions concerning the history and examination of the movement
are helpful:
• What is the distribution of the movements across body parts?
• Are the movements symmetric?
• What is the speed of the involuntary movements? Are they rapid and
fast or slow and sustained?
• When do the movements occur? Are they present at rest? Are they
present with maintained posture or with voluntary actions?
• Are the movements seen in relation to certain postures or body positions?
• Do the abnormal movements occur only with specific tasks?
• Can the child voluntarily suppress the movements, even for a short
time?
• Are the movements stereotyped?
• Are the movements rhythmic?
• What is the temporal pattern of the movements? Are they continuous or intermittent? Do they occur in discrete episodes?
• Are the involuntary movements preceded by an urge to make the
movement?
• Do the movements persist during sleep?
• Are the movements associated with impairment of motor function?
• What factors aggravate or alleviate the movements?
The first decision to be made is whether the movement disorder is
hyperkinetic (characterized by excessive and involuntary movements)
or hypokinetic (characterized by slow voluntary movements and a
general paucity of movement). Hyperkinetic movement disorders are
much more common than hypokinetic disorders in children. Once the
category of movement disorder is recognized, the etiology can be considered. The clinical history, including the birth history, medication/
toxin exposure, trauma, infections, family history, progression of the
involuntary movements, developmental progress, and behavior, should
be explored as the underlying cause is established. Table 637.1 lists the
types and clinical characteristics of selected hyperkinetic movement
disorders. A diagnostic approach to paroxysmal movement disorders is
noted in Figure 637.1; age-­related presentations of paroxysmal movement disorders are noted in Figure 637.2.

637.1 Ataxias
Peter E. Morrison and Jonathan W. Mink
Ataxia is the inability to make smooth, accurate, and coordinated
movements. It occurs because of a dysfunction of the cerebellum, its
inputs or outputs, its sensory pathways in the posterior columns of
the spinal cord, or a combination of these. Ataxias may be generalized but can also primarily affect the gait, the hands and arms, or the
trunk; they may be acute or chronic, or acquired or genetic (Tables
637.2-­637.8).
Signs and symptoms of ataxia include clumsiness, difficulty walking or sitting, falling to one side, slurred speech, low muscle tone,
intention tremor, dizziness, delayed motor development, or a combination of these. Genetic or chronic causes of cerebellar ataxia
are often characterized by a long duration of symptoms, a positive
family history, muscle weakness and abnormal gait, abnormal tone
and strength, abnormal deep tendon reflexes, pes cavus, and sensory defects. Distinguishing ataxia from vestibular dysfunction may
be difficult; however, labyrinth disorders are often characterized by
severe vertigo, nausea and vomiting, position-­induced vertigo, and a
severe sense of unsteadiness.
Congenital anomalies of the posterior fossa, including Dandy-­
Walker malformation, Chiari malformation, and encephalocele, are
prominently associated with ataxia because of their destruction or
abnormal development of the cerebellum (see Chapter 631.8). MRI

Table 637.1  Selected Types of Involuntary Movement in
Childhood
TYPE

CHARACTERISTICS

Stereotypies (see Chapter 37)

Involuntary, patterned,
coordinated, repetitive, rhythmic
movements that occur in the
same fashion with each repetition

Tics (see Chapter 37)

Involuntary, sudden, rapid, abrupt,
repetitive, nonrhythmic, simple
or complex motor movements
or vocalizations (phonic
productions). Tics are usually
preceded by an urge that is
relieved by carrying out the
movement.

Tremor (see Chapter 637.2)

Oscillating, rhythmic movements
about a fixed point, axis, or plane

Dystonia (see Chapter 637.4)

Intermittent and sustained
involuntary muscle contractions
that produce abnormal postures
and movements of different parts
of the body, often with a twisting
quality

Chorea (see Chapter 637.2)

Involuntary, continual, irregular
movements or movement
fragments with variable rate and
direction that occur unpredictably
and randomly

Ballism

Involuntary, high-­amplitude,
flinging movements typically
occurring proximally. Ballism is
essentially a large-­amplitude
chorea

Athetosis (see Chapter 637.2)

Slow, writhing, continuous,
involuntary movements

Myoclonus (see Chapter 637.3)

Sudden, quick, involuntary muscle
jerks

shows hypoplasia of the superior cerebellar vermis with upward bowing
of the roof of the fourth ventricle. B, Axial T2-­weighted image shows
the molar tooth at the level of the midbrain, the hallmark of Joubert
syndrome and related disorders (JSRD). (From Rollins N. Congenital
brain malformations. In: Coley BD, ed. Caffey’s Pediatric Diagnostic
Imaging, 13th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier; 2019, Fig. 31.29AB, p. 286.)

is the method of choice for investigating congenital abnormalities of the
cerebellum, vermis, and related structures. Agenesis of the cerebellar
vermis presents in infancy with generalized hypotonia and decreased
deep tendon reflexes. Delayed motor milestones and truncal ataxia are
typical. Joubert syndrome and related disorders are autosomal recessive disorders marked by developmental delay, hypotonia, abnormal
eye movements, abnormal respirations, and a distinctive malformation
of the cerebellum and brainstem that manifests as the “molar tooth
sign” on axial MRI (Fig. 637.3). Pathogenic variants in more than 21
different genes are associated with Joubert syndrome, but only approximately 50% of patients have demonstrated a pathogenic variant.
The major infectious or postinfectious causes of ataxia include acute
cerebellar ataxia, infectious cerebellitis, immune-­mediated cerebellitis,
and acute labyrinthitis. Acute cerebellar ataxia occurs primarily in children 1-­3 years of age and is a diagnosis of exclusion. The condition often
follows a viral illness, such as varicella virus, coxsackievirus, or echovirus infection, by 2-­3 weeks. It is thought to represent an autoimmune
response to the viral agent affecting the cerebellum (see Chapter 643).
The onset is typically sudden, and the truncal ataxia can be so severe
that the child is unable to stand or sit. Vomiting may occur initially,
but fever and nuchal rigidity are absent because of the lack of meningeal involvement. Horizontal nystagmus is evident in ∼50% of cases; if
the child is able to speak, dysarthria may be impressive. Examination
of the cerebrospinal fluid is typically normal at the onset of ataxia, but a
mild lymphocytic pleocytosis (10-­30/mm3) is not unusual. Later in the
course, the cerebrospinal fluid protein undergoes a moderate elevation.
The ataxia begins to improve in a few weeks but may persist for as long
as 3 months, and rarely longer than that. The incidence of acute cerebellar ataxia appears to have declined with increased rates of vaccination
against varicella. The prognosis for complete recovery is excellent. A
small number of patients have long-­term sequelae, including behavioral
and speech disorders, as well as ataxia and incoordination. Acute cerebellitis, in contrast, is a more severe form of cerebellar ataxia characterized by abnormalities on MRI scans, more severe symptoms, and a
worse long-­term prognosis. Infectious agents include Epstein-­Barr virus,
mycoplasma, mumps, and influenza virus. An inflammatory process
such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis may involve the cerebellum. Cerebellar abscesses can also occur with bacterial infections. In
many, the etiology is unknown, but autoimmune cerebellitis may represent some of these unknown cases. Clinically, patients may present with
ataxia, increased intracranial pressure from obstructive hydrocephalus,
headache, and fever. Acute labyrinthitis may be difficult to differentiate
from acute cerebellar ataxia in a toddler. The condition is associated with
middle ear infections and presents with intense vertigo, vomiting, and
abnormalities in labyrinthine function.
Toxic causes of ataxia include alcohol, thallium (which is used
occasionally in homes as a pesticide), dextromethorphan, and

Fig. 637.4 Conjunctival telangiectasia in a patient with ataxia-­
telangiectasia. (From Daroff RB, Jankovic J, Mazziotta JC, et al., eds.

2016, Fig. 97.6, p. 1468.)

anticonvulsants, particularly phenytoin and carbamazepine, when
serum levels exceed the usual therapeutic range.
Brain tumors (see Chapter 546), including tumors of the cerebellum and frontal lobe, may present with ataxia. Cerebellar tumors cause
ataxia because of direct disruption of cerebellar function or indirectly
because of increased intracranial pressure from compression of the
fourth ventricle. Frontal lobe tumors may cause ataxia as a consequence
of destruction or interruption of the associated fibers connecting the
frontal lobe with the cerebellum or because of increased intracranial
pressure. Neuroblastoma (see Chapter 547) may be associated with a
paraneoplastic encephalopathy characterized by progressive ataxia,
myoclonic jerks, and opsoclonus (nonrhythmic, conjugate horizontal
and vertical oscillations of the eyes).
Several metabolic disorders are characterized by ataxia, including
abetalipoproteinemia, arginosuccinic aciduria, and Hartnup disease
(see Table 637.2). Abetalipoproteinemia (Bassen-­Kornzweig disease)
is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a pathogenic variant in the
microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). This disorder begins
in childhood with steatorrhea and failure to thrive. A blood smear
shows acanthocytosis, which consists of spiculated red blood cells.
Serum chemistries reveal decreased levels of cholesterol and triglycerides and absent serum β-­lipoproteins. Neurologic signs become evident
by late childhood and consist of ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, peripheral
neuritis, abnormalities of position and vibration sense, muscle weakness, and intellectual disability. Vitamin E is undetectable in the serum
of patients with neurologic symptoms. In addition, ataxia may be one
manifestation of a mitochondrial disorder; these include myoclonic
epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERFF), Kearns-­Sayre syndrome,
POLG1 pathogenic variants, and Charlevoix-­Saguenay syndrome.
Degenerative diseases of the central nervous system represent
an important group of ataxic disorders of childhood because of the
genetic consequences and poor prognosis. Ataxia-­telangiectasia, an
autosomal recessive condition, is the most common of the degenerative
ataxias and is heralded by ataxia beginning at approximately age 2 and
progressing to loss of ambulation by adolescence. Ataxia-­telangiectasia
is caused by pathogenic variants in ATM. ATM is a phosphatidylinositol-­3 kinase that phosphorylates proteins involved in DNA repair and
cell-­cycle control. Oculomotor apraxia of horizontal gaze, defined as
difficulty shifting the gaze from one object to another and overshooting the target with lateral movement of the head, followed by refixating the eyes, is a frequent finding. In addition, strabismus, hypometric
saccade pursuit abnormalities, and nystagmus are often seen. Ataxia-­
telangiectasia may also present with chorea (see Chapter 637.2) rather
than ataxia. The telangiectasia becomes evident by mid-­childhood
and is found on the bulbar conjunctiva, over the bridge of the nose,
and on the ears and exposed surfaces of the extremities (Fig. 637.4).
Examination of the skin shows a loss of elasticity. Abnormalities of

immunologic function that lead to frequent sinopulmonary infections
include decreased serum and secretory immunoglobulin (Ig) A, as well
as diminished IgG2, IgG4, and IgE levels in more than 50% of patients.
Children with ataxia-­telangiectasia have a 50-­to 100-­fold increased
risk of developing lymphoreticular tumors (lymphoma, leukemia, and
Hodgkin disease) and brain tumors. Additional laboratory abnormalities include an increased incidence of chromosome breaks, particularly
of chromosome 14, and elevated levels of α-­fetoprotein. Death typically
results from infection or tumor dissemination.
Friedreich ataxia is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder involving the spinocerebellar tracts, dorsal columns in the spinal
cord, pyramidal tracts, and cerebellum and medulla. Most patients are
homozygous for a GAA trinucleotide repeat expansion in the noncoding region of the gene coding for the mitochondrial protein frataxin.
Pathogenic variants cause oxidative injury associated with excessive
iron deposits in mitochondria. The onset of ataxia is somewhat later
than in ataxia-­telangiectasia but usually occurs before the age of 10.
The ataxia is slowly progressive and involves the lower extremities to
a greater degree than the upper extremities. Examination will demonstrate a positive Romberg test and absent deep tendon reflexes
(particularly at the ankle); the plantar response is typically extensor
(Babinski sign). Patients develop a characteristic explosive, dysarthric
speech; nystagmus is present in most children. Although patients may
appear apathetic, their intelligence is preserved. They may have significant weakness of the distal musculature of the hands and feet. Marked
loss of vibration and joint position sense is common and is caused by
degeneration of the posterior columns. Friedreich ataxia is also characterized by skeletal abnormalities, including high-­arched feet (pes
cavus) and hammer toes, as well as progressive kyphoscoliosis. Results
of electrophysiologic studies, including visual, auditory brainstem, and
somatosensory-­evoked potentials, are often abnormal. Hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy with progression to intractable congestive heart failure is the cause of death for most patients.
In addition to ataxia-­telangiectasia and Friedreich ataxia, there are
more than 40 other known inherited causes of either autosomal dominant or recessive forms of ataxia (Fig. 637.5; see Tables 637.4-­637.8).
More specifically, there are more than 20 dominantly inherited spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), some of which are also repeat expansion

disorders and can present in childhood. These include those associated
with CAG (polyglutamine) trinucleotide repeats and noncoding microsatellite expansions. There is also a separate group of dominantly inherited episodic ataxias (EAs) caused by potassium or calcium channel
dysfunction. These disorders present as episodes of ataxia and muscle
weakness and at times may respond to acetazolamide. The dominantly
inherited olivopontocerebellar atrophies include ataxia, cranial nerve
palsies, and abnormal sensory findings in the second or third decade,
but can present in children with rapidly progressive ataxia, nystagmus, dysarthria, and seizures. Roussy-­Levy disease has, in addition
to ataxia, atrophy of the muscles of the lower extremity with a pattern
of wasting similar to that observed in Charcot-­Marie-­Tooth disease.
Ramsay Hunt syndrome has an associated myoclonic epilepsy.
Additional degenerative ataxias include Pelizaeus-­Merzbacher disease, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, and late-­onset GM2 gangliosidosis (see Chapter 639). Rare forms of progressive cerebellar ataxia
have been described in association with vitamin E deficiency.

637.2 Chorea, Athetosis, and Tremor
Jennifer A. Vermilion and Jonathan W. Mink
Chorea, meaning “dance-­like” in Greek, refers to rapid, chaotic movements that seem to flow unpredictably from one body part to another.
Affected individuals often appear restless, and movements exhibit
randomness. They often demonstrate motor impersistence on neurologic examination, showing classic signs such as “darting tongue” (difficulty maintaining tongue protrusion) or “milkmaid grip” (difficulty
maintaining grip). Chorea tends to occur both at rest and with action,
although certain actions or postures can exacerbate chorea. Patients
often attempt to incorporate the involuntary movements into more
purposeful-­seeming movements, making them appear fidgety. Chorea
increases with stress and disappears in sleep. Chorea has traditionally
been divided into primary and secondary forms; however, this classification scheme in movement disorders can cause confusion given the
recent explosion of genetic discoveries in the field. Rather, it may be
more helpful to classify chorea causes by etiology: acquired or inherited (Tables 637.9 and 637.10).
Sydenham chorea (St. Vitus dance; rheumatic chorea) is the most
common acquired chorea of childhood, although the prevalence varies worldwide. It occurs in 10–20% of patients with acute rheumatic
fever, typically weeks to months after a group A β-­hemolytic streptococcal infection (see Chapter 194). Peak incidence is at age 8-­9 years,
with a female predominance of 2:1. There is evidence that group A
β-­hemolytic streptococci promote the generation of cross-­reactive or
polyreactive antibodies through molecular mimicry between streptococcal and host antigens. Specifically, antibodies against the N-­
acetyl-­β-­d-­glucosamine epitope (GlcNAc) of streptococcal group A
carbohydrate appear to target intracellular β-­tubulin and extracellular
lysoganglioside GM1 in human caudate-­putamen preparations. These
antibodies are also capable of causing calcium/calmodulin–dependent
protein kinase II activation, which may cause the neurologic manifestations of Sydenham chorea by increasing dopamine release into the
synapse.
The clinical hallmarks of Sydenham chorea are chorea, hypotonia, and
emotional lability. Onset of the chorea is typically over hours to days,
but it may be more abrupt. Chorea is typically generalized, although
often asymmetric; up to 20% have hemichorea. Parents may describe
the child as seeming clumsy and dropping items while awake with cessation of adventitious movements during sleep. Hypotonia manifests
with the pronator sign (arms and palms turn outward when held overhead) and the choreic hand (spooning of the extended hand by flexion
of the wrist and extension of the fingers). When chorea and hypotonia
are severe, the child may be incapable of feeding, dressing, or walking
without assistance. Speech is often involved, sometimes to the point of
being unintelligible. Periods of uncontrollable crying and extreme mood

swings are characteristic and may precede the onset of the movement
disorder. Patients may also demonstrate inattention, anxiety, obsessive-­
compulsive symptoms, paranoia, and a reluctance to speak. It is not clear
if these psychiatric symptoms represent an increased susceptibility to
developing Sydenham chorea or if they are part of the disorder.
Sydenham chorea is a clinical diagnosis; a combination of acute and
convalescent serum antistreptolysin O titers may help to confirm an
acute streptococcal infection. Negative titers do not exclude the diagnosis. All patients with Sydenham chorea should be evaluated for carditis and treated with long-­term antibiotic prophylaxis to decrease the
risk of rheumatic heart disease with recurrence (see Chapter 487). This
prophylaxis should be continued until the patient is 21 years old. For
patients with chorea that is impairing, treatment options include valproate, carbamazepine, and dopamine receptor antagonists. There have
been conflicting data regarding the efficacy of prednisone, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and other immunomodulatory agents
in Sydenham chorea, making it difficult to recommend their routine
use. One study compared high-­dose prednisone (2 mg/kg/day, max: 60
mg) for 4 weeks to placebo and found that steroids reduced the time
to remission. Another trial of IVIG, plasma exchange, and low-­dose
prednisone demonstrated an overall decreased severity of chorea in the
IVIG and plasma exchange groups at 1-­month follow-­up. There is no
evidence that prednisone, IVIG, or plasma exchange alters the recurrence rate or long-­term outcome. Given the lack of impact on long-­term
outcome and the potential for side effects, immunomodulatory treatments are optional.
Sydenham chorea usually resolves spontaneously within 1 year, but
symptoms may recur in about 20% of patients despite penicillin prophylaxis. Remote recurrence of chorea is rare, but may be provoked
by streptococcal infections, pregnancy (chorea gravidarum), or oral
contraceptive use.
Although less common than Sydenham chorea, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS)
(see Chapter 199) are known causes of chorea in children. In some
cases, chorea may be the presenting sign of these disorders and clinically may be indistinguishable from Sydenham chorea.
Anti N-­methyl-­D-­aspartic acid (anti-­NMDA) receptor encephalitis is an immune-­mediated encephalitis with movement disorder as
a prominent feature. Abnormal movements, including chorea, may be
the presenting feature in some cases. Other commonly reported abnormal movements include dystonia, stereotypies (limb and oral), and
motor perseveration. In addition to abnormal movements, psychiatric
symptoms, seizures, and autonomic instability commonly occur. Treatment includes removal of the tumor, if present, and immune therapies
such as steroids, IVIG, plasma exchange, and rituximab.
Additional causes of acquired chorea include metabolic (hyperthyroidism, hypoparathyroidism), infectious (Lyme disease), vascular
(stroke, moyamoya disease, postpump chorea), heredodegenerative
disorders (Wilson disease), and drugs (see Table 637.9). Although chorea is a hallmark of Huntington disease in adults, children who develop
Huntington disease tend to present with rigidity and bradykinesia
(Westphal variant) or dystonia rather than chorea.
Various genetic diseases may manifest with chorea; some present
with predominantly chorea, but most have a combination of neurologic,
psychiatric, and systemic manifestations that accompany the movement
disorder (see Table 637.10). Benign hereditary chorea is a relatively rare
cause of chorea in childhood. It typically presents before age 5 years; the
chorea is either stable or slowly progressive. Chorea tends to improve in
the late teen to young adult years and often remits by mid-­adulthood.
It is most commonly secondary to a pathogenic variant in NKX2-­1,
which encodes for the protein thyroid transcription factor-­1 (TTF1).
The majority of patients (80%) also have hypothyroidism or neonatal
respiratory distress syndrome (brain-­lung-­thyroid syndrome). Variants
in NKX2-­1 confer increased risk of lung cancer or emphysema in adulthood. Although children are considered cognitively normal, there are
reports of an increased incidence of learning disabilities and attention-­
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in this population.
In ADCY5-­related dyskinesia, chorea is a core feature. There is a phenotypic variability to this disorder, but some patients present with a form
of familial benign chorea with onset of paroxysmal movements starting

Intellectual disability, pronounced

choreoathetosis

anywhere from infancy to late adolescence. Although chorea is the most
commonly described movement, there are reports of myoclonic or dystonic movements as well. Movements are more common in the arms and
face and less common in the legs. ADCY5-­related dyskinesia has commonly been associated with choreic facial twitches that were previously
considered facial myokymia (known as familial dyskinesia with facial
myokymia). Interestingly, movements in this form can persist in sleep.
Symptoms can fluctuate such that chorea may be paroxysmal; they tend
to be worsened by specific actions and anxiety. These patients also tend
to have a stable or very slowly progressive course that tends to stabilize
and even improve in middle age. ADCY5-­related dyskinesia can have
a more severe presentation with infantile onset of axial hypotonia and
developmental delay. ADCY5-­related dyskinesia has not been associated
with thyroid or lung disease; however, heart failure has been reported
in five patients. Although these conditions are called benign, these
movements can be disabling and progressive in some patients. Therefore some patients may warrant symptomatic treatment. Although there
is no proven symptomatic treatment for these conditions, there have
been reports of benefit with dopamine receptor–blocking or –depleting
agents. In a few cases, low-­dose levodopa has provided benefit.
A pure, benign, and nonprogressive childhood-­onset chorea has
been described in a few patients with pathogenic variants in PDE10A,
which encodes for a phosphodiesterase. Children with de novo dominant variants characteristically have symmetric T2 hyperintensities in
the bilateral striatum on brain MRI. Children with recessive homozygous variants have been described with an earlier age of onset and a
more severe clinical course.
Paroxysmal dyskinesias can present with chorea or dystonia, or both;
chorea is most commonly associated with paroxysmal nonkinesigenic
dyskinesia (PNKD). This disorder presents in the first decade of life,
with ∼30% of patients manifesting symptoms in the first year of life.
Patients often have both chorea and dystonia, although some patients
manifest only dystonia. Episodes can last minutes to hours, and children are normal between episodes. The episodes are not triggered by
sudden movement but can be precipitated by alcohol, caffeine, or emotional stress. About half of patients report a premonitory sensation

or a sense of anxiety before an episode. Although various genes have
been implicated in this disorder, PNKD (formerly known as MR-­1) is
most commonly associated with PNKD. Patients with a PNKD pathogenic variant often respond to benzodiazepines; avoidance of triggers
is also important. Symptoms typically improve with age. Variants in
KCNMA1 can also cause a PNKD phenotype, although these children
often have other neurologic abnormalities.
Some inherited disorders classified as ataxia syndromes also manifest with significant chorea. Ataxia-­telangiectasia typically presents as
a mixed movement disorder with ataxia, dystonia, and chorea in early
childhood (18 months to 3 years). These symptoms present before the
appearance of telangiectasias. Over time, children have progression
of limb and gait involvement and typically become nonambulatory in
childhood. Children also present with oculomotor apraxia (difficulty in
initiating horizontal and vertical saccades). Ataxia-­telangiectasia is an
autosomal recessive disorder secondary to pathogenic variants in ATM.
Because this gene encodes for a protein involved in DNA repair mechanisms, affected children are at increased risk of sinopulmonary infectious and lymphoreticular neoplasms. When this disease is suspected,
the initial workup involves testing the alpha-­fetoprotein (AFP) level,
which is abnormally increased in this population. Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1) is also associated with a mixed movement disorder and is caused by variants in APTX, which encodes for the
aprataxin protein. Up to 80% of children have chorea and dystonia as
their initial symptoms. Other neurologic symptoms include oculomotor
apraxia, ataxia, and a distal sensory axonal neuropathy. The movement
disorder tends to be most severe early in the disease and improves as the
disease progresses. Unlike ataxia-­telangiectasia, this disorder is not associated with skin findings or an increased incidence of cancer.
Chorea can also be a major manifestation in children with inherited conditions that have a progressive, severe course. Pontocerebellar
hypoplasia type 2A (PCH-­2A) is associated with chorea present from
a young age. The majority of patients have chorea within the first 6
months of life. PCH-­2A is associated with an acquired microcephaly,
extrapyramidal dyskinesias, and spasticity. These children have significant psychomotor delay with early death. Although various genes have

3678 Part XXV u The Nervous System
been implicated in the different forms of pontocerebellar hypoplasia,
PCH-­2A is associated with pathogenic variants in TSEN54, which
encodes for a protein involved in transfer RNA (tRNA) splicing. Variants in GNAO1, which encodes for the alpha subunit of G proteins,
have been described as causing a particular movement disorder in
affected children. This gene has previously been described as a cause of
early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (Ohtahara syndrome). However, affected children may instead manifest with hypotonia, developmental delay without epilepsy, and a movement disorder characterized
by chorea and ballismus in the first decade of life. Chorea tends to start
acutely during an illness. Some children with GNAO1 variants have a
severe movement disorder without seizures. Orofacial dyskinesias are
common. Children often have periods of movement exacerbations that
can be accompanied by autonomic changes. These movements can be
refractory to treatment and led to death in two of the children in a
study. Deep brain stimulation has been proposed as a potential treatment for these medically refractory children. FOXG1 variants are associated with postnatal microcephaly, an early epileptic encephalopathy,
and abnormal movements. Chorea is commonly reported and may
involve the upper extremities and orolingual muscles. Dystonia, athetosis, and stereotypies are also reported.
Athetosis is characterized by slow, continuous, writhing movements that repeatedly involve the same body part(s), usually the distal
extremities, face, neck, or trunk. Like chorea, athetosis may occur at
rest and is often worsened by voluntary movement. Because athetosis
tends to occur with other movement disorders, such as chorea (choreoathetosis) and dystonia, it is often difficult to distinguish as a discrete
entity. Choreoathetosis is common in dyskinetic cerebral palsy, which
can result from hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, kernicterus, or other
basal ganglia injuries. Cerebral palsy is a static disturbance in the developing brain that results in motor impairment. Dyskinetic cerebral palsy,
the second most common form after spastic cerebral palsy, typically
presents with dystonia and choreoathetosis. The choreoathetosis is typically more common in the upper body. Choreoathetosis is often seen in
conjunction with rigidity—increased muscle tone that is equal in the
flexors and extensors in all directions of passive movement regardless of
the velocity of the movement. This is to be differentiated from spasticity, a velocity-­dependent (clasp-­knife) form of hypertonia that is seen
with upper motor neuron dysfunction. Case reports in dyskinetic cerebral palsy report chorea improvement with levetiracetam. In addition,
a small study of risperidone in children with dyskinetic cerebral palsy
reported improvement in abnormal movements and behavior.
Tremor is a rhythmic, oscillatory movement around a central point
or plane that results from the action of antagonist muscles. Tremor can
affect the extremities, head, trunk, or voice and can be classified by
both its frequency (slow [4 Hz], intermediate [4-­7 Hz], and fast [>7
Hz]) and by the context in which it is most pronounced. Rest tremor is
maximal when the affected body part is inactive and supported against
gravity, whereas postural tremor is most notable when the patient
sustains a position against gravity. Action tremor occurs with performance of a voluntary activity and can be subclassified into simple
kinetic tremor, which occurs with limb movement, and intention
tremor, which occurs as the patient’s limb approaches a target and is a
feature of cerebellar disease.
Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder in
adults, and 50% of persons diagnosed with ET report an onset in childhood; thus ET may be the most common tremor disorder in children
as well. Clinical experience in a pediatric movement disorders clinic
suggests that ET is more common in the pediatric population than the
literature would suggest. ET is an autosomal dominant condition with
variable expressivity but complete penetrance by the age of 60 years.
Although the genetics of ET are not fully understood, at least five genes
(EMT1, EMT2, EMT3, EMT4, and EMT5) are linked to this condition. In addition, polymorphisms in the gene LINGO1 (also known as
LRRN6A) have been associated with ET.
ET is characterized by a slowly progressive, bilateral, 4-­to 9-­Hz
postural tremor that involves the upper extremities and occurs in
the absence of other known causes of tremor. Face, neck, and voice
tremors are less common but can occur. Mild asymmetry in the

upper extremities is common, but ET is rarely unilateral. ET may be
worsened by actions, such as trying to pour water from cup to cup.
Affected adults may report a history of ethanol responsiveness. In the
adult literature, there is a consensus on diagnostic criteria; there are no
specific criteria in children. Unlike adults, children do not require a
5-­year duration of symptoms to make the diagnosis of ET. Most young
children come to medical attention once a parent, teacher, or therapist
notices the tremor, rather than because the tremor causes impairment.
Most children with ET do not require pharmacologic intervention. If
they are having difficulty with their handwriting or self-­feeding, an
occupational therapy evaluation and/or assistive devices, such as wrist
weights and weighted silverware, may be helpful. Teenagers tend to
report more impairment from ET. Teenagers who do warrant pharmacotherapy usually respond to the same medications that are used in
adults—propranolol and primidone. Propranolol, which is generally
considered the first-­line treatment, can be started at 10-­40 mg daily
and titrated to effect, with most patients responding to doses of 60-­
80 mg/day. Propranolol should not be used in patients with reactive
airway disease. Primidone can be started at 12.5-­25 mg at bedtime and
increased gradually in a twice-­daily schedule. Most patients respond
to doses of 50-­200 mg/day. Other treatment options for ET reported
in the adult literature include atenolol, gabapentin, pregabalin, topiramate, and alprazolam. Surgical treatments, which include deep brain
stimulation of the thalamus and unilateral thalamotomy, are generally
reserved for adults with medically refractory disabling tremor.
Enhanced physiologic tremor is one of the most common etiologies of
tremor in adolescents. This tremor occurs in healthy people and is characterized by a symmetric hand tremor that is often of faster frequency and
lower amplitude than an ET. Triggers include increased emotions, fatigue,
fever, hunger, and waking from sleep. Substances such as caffeine may
enhance a tremor. Weighted objects may decrease tremor frequency.
In children 3-­7 years old, coordination difficulties due to developmental delay can present with nonprogressive tremor. Many children
with motor delays will have a hand and possibly truncal tremor that
is most apparent with fine motor tasks, such as drawing, using scissors, or playing with small toys. The history often shows that these children are behind typically developing children in terms of fine and/or
gross motor skills and speech articulation. Examination shows that the
movement tends to be a small-­amplitude, regular or irregular postural
or intention tremor. Walking and running may be clumsy. Evidence-­
based treatment has not been established for tremor related to developmental delay; however, referral to occupational therapy may help to
identify strategies to improve coordination in these children.
Infantile tremor syndrome is a disorder of unknown etiology that
presents at age 6-­18 months with regression or plateaued development,
coarse tremor, and anemia. Potential etiologies include deficiencies in
vitamin B12, iron, zinc, or magnesium.
There are numerous secondary etiologies of tremor in children
(Table 637.11). Holmes tremor, previously referred to as midbrain or
“rubral” tremor, is characterized by a slow-­frequency, high-­amplitude
tremor that is present at rest and with intention. It is a symptomatic
tremor, which usually results from lesions of the brainstem, cerebellum, or thalamus. Functional (psychogenic) tremor is distinguished
by its variable appearance, abrupt onset and remission, nonprogressive
course, and association with selective but not task-­specific disabilities.
In some cases, tremor may even occur as a manifestation of another
movement disorder, as is seen with position-­or task-­specific tremor
(e.g., writing tremor), dystonic tremor, and myoclonic tremor.
When evaluating a child with tremor, it is important to screen for
common metabolic disturbances, including electrolyte abnormalities and thyroid disease, assess the child’s caffeine intake, and review
the child’s medication list for known tremor-­inducing agents. It is
also critical to exclude Wilson disease in teenagers with characteristic
“wing-­beating” tremor (low-­frequency/high-­amplitude posture initiated with horizontal position and abduction of arms, flexed elbows,
and downward-­facing palms with resultant shoulder and hand tremors) because this is a treatable condition.

637.3 Myoclonus
Jonathan W. Mink
Myoclonus refers to brief, abrupt, involuntary, nonsuppressible, jerky
contractions (or interruption of contractions) involving a single muscle
or muscle group. The rapidity of these movements is often described as
shocklike. In some cases, myoclonus can be elicited by a sensory stimulus (reflex myoclonus; the most common example is the acoustic startle
response in infancy) or volitional movement (action myoclonus). It is
present in normal and pathologic situations, both epileptic and nonepileptic. Epileptic myoclonus is discussed in Chapter 633. Etiologic
classification of myoclonus is summarized in Table 637.12.
Physiologic myoclonus occurs in healthy individuals in specific settings. It includes such entities as hiccups, sleep starts, and sleep myoclonus. Sleep starts, also known as hypnic or hypnagogic myoclonus, occur
with sleep initiation. They are often accompanied by a sense of falling.
Sleep starts are normal physiologic phenomena, and no treatment is
required. Sleep myoclonus (nocturnal myoclonus) is also a part of normal sleep physiology. It typically occurs during rapid eye movement
(REM) sleep owing to transient failure of brainstem inhibition. Sleep
myoclonus tends to persist throughout life. No treatment is required.
Benign myoclonus may occur in association with specific developmental stages. Benign neonatal sleep myoclonus is characterized by
repetitive myoclonic jerks occurring during sleep. The myoclonus is typically more distal than proximal and is more prominent in the upper than
the lower extremities. The myoclonus can be focal, multifocal, unilateral,
or bilateral. Typically, the movements occur in clusters of jerks at 1-­5
Hz over a period of several seconds. Benign neonatal sleep myoclonus

3679

begins during the first week of life, diminishes in the second month, and
is usually gone before 6 months of age. The movements are most likely
to occur during quiet (non-­REM) sleep but have been described in all
sleep stages. Waking the baby causes the movements to abruptly cease.
Neurologic examination and outcome are normal.
Myoclonus also can occur with fever in otherwise normal children.
The myoclonic jerks may be quite frequent, but they are self-­limited,
ceasing when the fever resolves. Febrile myoclonus may be more common in younger children. No treatment is required.
Opsoclonus myoclonus (ataxia) syndrome (OMS/OMAS) is characterized by a combination of rapid, chaotic involuntary eye movements
(opsoclonus), multifocal myoclonus, and ataxia. Irritability is a common
feature. It typically begins abruptly in early childhood, most often before
age 5 years. A common misdiagnosis is acute cerebellar ataxia (ACA)
because both ACA and OMAS have subacute, progressive disturbances
in gait, truncal instability, and behavioral irritability. Irritable toddlers
are difficult to examine thoroughly, adding to the challenge of discerning
the presence of multifocal mini-­myoclonus and action myoclonus plus
ataxia in a toddler with OMAS versus titubation, gait, and limb ataxia in
ACA. At its peak, OMAS can cause marked disability for the child.
OMAS is an autoimmune condition in which there is abnormal B-­cell
trafficking in the central nervous system. It may follow a viral infection
in many cases. A large proportion of children (40% by one estimate) with
OMAS have a neuroblastoma, a potentially fatal neural crest tumor (see
Chapter 547). Conversely, only a small proportion of children with neuroblastoma (probably <5%) have OMAS. The subacute onset of OMAS
and the association with neural crest tumors support an autoimmune
paraneoplastic etiology. Intensive research into multiple circulating autoantibodies, including antibodies to Purkinje cell targets, has not, to date,
identified any unique, consistently present, disease-­associated antibody.
OMAS is a clinical diagnosis. In the presence of subacute irritability,
tremor, and ataxia, a diagnosis of OMAS must be considered, and children
diagnosed with ACA should continue to be monitored for the emergence
of symptoms characteristic of OMAS. The presence of opsoclonus has a
high positive predictive value for OMAS, but its absence does not have a
high negative predictive value. That is because opsoclonus can be subtle,
intermittent, or late, so clinicians and parents need to continue to watch
for it. Brain MRI should be normal, and cerebrospinal fluid unremarkable.
No immune studies are clinically established for this diagnosis. The search
for a neuroblastoma should be thorough and persistent in this clinical setting. MRI with gadolinium or CT with contrast of the chest and abdomen
has the highest yield. Nuclear medicine 131I-­MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) or 111In-­penetreotide (somatostatin receptor ligand) PET scans
and urine collection for elevated 24-­hour urine catecholamines and serum
neuron-­specific enolase may be considered but have a lower yield.
Multimodal treatment is required for OMAS. If related to neuroblastoma, the child will likely need immune-­modulating treatments even
if a tumor is identified and resected. Adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH)
protocols are recommended based on expert consensus and clinical
experience. In addition to ACTH, combination treatment with IVIG,
plasmapheresis, rituximab, or other immune-­modulating therapies may
be needed. Symptomatic pharmacologic and behavioral therapy for
myoclonus, behavioral problems, aggression, and insomnia may also be
beneficial. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy
may be beneficial. Suboptimal cognitive outcomes occur in most cases.
Causes of other types of myoclonus are listed in Table 637.12. Differentiating myoclonus and other movement disorders from a functional
neurologic disorder may be difficult. Clues to a functional disorder are
noted in Table 637.13.
Treatment of myoclonus is symptomatic and may be ineffective in
many cases. Cortical myoclonus may respond to benzodiazepines and
is commonly treated with clonazepam (although sleep myoclonus may
worsen). Valproic acid is sometimes helpful, but it must be used with
caution because of its ability to cause tremor as a side effect, with consequent confusion of symptoms. Other epilepsy medications, including levetiracetam and zonisamide, may be effective in some forms of
myoclonus. Carbamazepine can worsen myoclonus.

637.4 Dystonia
Shannon L. Dean and Erika F. Augustine
Dystonia is a disorder of movement characterized by sustained muscle
contractions, frequently causing twisting and repetitive movements or
abnormal postures (Table 637.14). Major causes of dystonia include
primary generalized dystonia, medications, metabolic disorders, and
perinatal asphyxia (Tables 637.15 and 637.16).

INHERITED PRIMARY DYSTONIAS

Primary generalized dystonia, also referred to as primary torsion
dystonia or dystonia musculorum deformans, is caused by a group of
genetic disorders with onset in childhood (Fig. 637.6). Many of these
disorders are autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance, but
genetic dystonias may also appear sporadically or be inherited in an
autosomal recessive, X-­linked, or mitochondrial pattern. Children
are more likely to manifest with or progress to generalized dystonia,
whereas segmental or focal dystonia is more common in adolescents
and adults.

One form, which occurs more commonly in the Ashkenazi Jewish
population, is caused by a dominant change in DYT1 coding for the
adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–binding protein torsinA. The initial
manifestation of DYT1 dystonia is often intermittent unilateral posturing of a lower extremity, which assumes an extended and rotated
position. Ultimately, all four extremities and the axial musculature can
be affected, but the dystonia may also remain localized to one limb.
Cranial involvement can occur in DYT1 dystonia, but it is uncommon
compared with non-­DYT1 dystonias. There is a wide clinical spectrum,
varying even within families. If a family history of dystonia is absent,
the diagnosis should still be considered, given the intrafamilial variability in clinical expression.
More than two dozen loci for genes for torsion dystonia have been
identified (DYT1-­DYT31). More sophisticated genetic testing and
genotype-­phenotype correlation have eliminated some of these designations, and others have been linked to specific chromosomal regions
but not yet to a specific gene. In this text we review only those linked
definitively to a specific gene.
One is the autosomal dominant disorder dopa-­responsive dystonia
(DRD, DYT5a), also called Segawa syndrome. The gene for DRD codes

for guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase 1, the rate-­limiting enzyme
for tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis, which is a cofactor for synthesis of the
neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin. Thus the genetic alteration
results in dopamine deficiency. The hallmark of the disorder, particularly
in adolescents and adults, is diurnal variation: symptoms worsen as the day
progresses and may transiently improve with sleep. Early-­onset patients,
who tend to present with delayed or abnormal gait from dystonia of a
lower extremity, can easily be confused with patients with dystonic cerebral palsy. It should be noted that in the presence of a progressive dystonia, diurnal fluctuation, or loss of previously achieved motor skills, a prior
diagnosis of cerebral palsy should be reexamined. DRD responds dramatically to small daily doses of levodopa. The responsiveness to levodopa is
a sustained benefit, even if the diagnosis is delayed several years, as long as

contractures have not developed. More rarely, an autosomal recessive form
of this disorder is caused by alterations in the TH gene.
Myoclonus dystonia (DYT11), caused by alterations in the SCGE
gene, is characterized by dystonia involving the upper extremities,
head, and/or neck, as well as myoclonic movements in these regions.
Although a combination of myoclonus and dystonia typically occurs,
each manifestation can present in isolation. When repetitive, the myoclonus may take on a tremor-­like appearance, termed dystonic tremor.
Improvement in symptoms after alcohol ingestion, reported by affected
adult family members, may be a helpful clue to this diagnosis.
Common to the inherited dystonias, there is considerable intrafamilial variability in clinical manifestations, distribution, and severity of
dystonia. In primary dystonias, although the main clinical features are
motor, there may be an increased risk for major depression. Anxiety,
obsessive-­compulsive disorder, and depression have all been reported
in myoclonus-­dystonia syndrome. Screening for psychiatric comorbidities should not be overlooked in this population.

Table 637.13  Clues Relating to the Signs and Symptoms
That Suggest a Functional Movement
Disorder

DRUG-­INDUCED DYSTONIAS

A number of medications are capable of inducing involuntary movements or drug-­
induced movement disorders in children and adults.
Dopamine-­blocking agents, including antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol)
and antiemetics (e.g., metoclopramide, prochlorperazine), as well as atypical antipsychotics (e.g., risperidone, aripiprazole) can produce acute dystonic reactions or delayed (tardive) drug-­induced movement disorders.
Acute dystonic reactions, occurring in the first days of exposure, typically
involve the face and neck and manifest as torticollis, retrocollis, oculogyric
crisis, or tongue protrusion. Life-­threatening presentations with laryngospasm and airway compromise can also occur, requiring prompt recognition and treatment of this entity. Intravenous diphenhydramine 1-­2 mg/
kg/dose (maximum dose 50 mg) may rapidly reverse the drug-­related dystonia. The degree of potency of the dopamine blocker, young age, and prior
dystonic reactions may be predisposing factors. Acute dystonic reactions
have also been described with cetirizine.
Severe rigidity combined with high fever, autonomic symptoms
(tachycardia, diaphoresis), delirium, and dystonia are signs of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which typically occurs a few days after starting
or increasing the dose of a neuroleptic drug or in the setting of withdrawal from a dopaminergic agent. In contrast to acute dystonic reactions, which take place within days, neuroleptic malignant syndrome
typically occurs within a month of medication initiation or dose increase.
Delayed-­
onset involuntary movements, tardive dyskinesias,
develop in the setting of chronic neuroleptic use, usually longer than
3 months. Involvement of the face, particularly the mouth, lips, and/
or jaw with chewing or tongue thrusting, is characteristic. The risk of
tardive dyskinesia, which is much less frequent in children compared
with adults, increases as the medication dose, duration of treatment,
and polypharmacy increase. There are data to suggest that children

1.	Abrupt onset
2.	Inconsistent movements (changing characteristics over time;
pattern, body distribution, rapidly varying severity)
3.	Incongruous movements and postures (movements that do not
fit with recognized patterns or with normal physiologic patterns)
4.	Presence of certain types of abnormal movements that are fairly
common among individuals with functional movement disorders,
such as:
• Rhythmical shaking
• Bizarre gait
• Deliberate slowness carrying out requested voluntary
movement
• Bursts of verbal gibberish
• Excessive startle (bizarre movements in response to sudden,
unexpected noise or threatening movement)
5.	Presence of additional types of abnormal movements that are
not known to be part of the primary or principal movement
pattern that the patient manifests
6.	Manifesting exhaustion, excessive fatigue
7.	Delayed, often excessive, startle response to a stimulus
8.	Spontaneous remissions
9.	Decrease or disappearance of movements with distraction
10.	Disappearance of tremors when handling treasured objects
11.	Entrainment of the tremor to the rate of the requested rapid
successive movement the patient is asked to perform
12.	Response to placebo, suggestion, or psychotherapy
13.	Dystonia beginning as a fixed posture
14.	Twisting facial movements that move the mouth to one side or
the other (note that organic dystonia of the facial muscles usually
does not move the mouth sideways)

METABOLIC DISORDERS

Disorders of monoamine neurotransmitter metabolism, of which
dopa-­responsive dystonia is one, present in infancy and early childhood with dystonia, hypotonia, oculogyric crises, and/or autonomic

symptoms. Common comorbidities such as epilepsy, developmental
delay, and microcephaly, which are also found in cerebral palsy and
other more common disorders, likely contribute to underdiagnosis of
this group of rare diseases. The more common disorders in this group
include DRD, tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency, and aromatic amino
acid decarboxylase deficiency. With the exception of aromatic amino
acid decarboxylase deficiency, most do respond at least partially to

levodopa. Abnormalities of the dopamine transporter (DAT) can also
present in infancy with dystonia.
Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive inborn error of copper transport characterized by cirrhosis of the liver and degenerative
changes in the central nervous system, particularly the basal ganglia
(see Chapter 405.2). It has been determined that there are multiple
alterations in the Wilson disease gene (WND), accounting for the variability in presentation of the condition. The neurologic manifestations
of Wilson disease rarely appear before age 10 years, and the initial sign
is often progressive dystonia. Tremors of the extremities develop, unilaterally at first, but they eventually become coarse, generalized, and
incapacitating. Other neurologic signs of Wilson disease relate to a
progressive basal ganglia disease, such as parkinsonism, dysarthria,
dysphonia, and choreoathetosis. Less frequent are ataxia and pyramidal signs. The MRI or CT scan shows ventricular dilation in advanced
cases, with atrophy of the cerebrum, cerebellum, and/or brainstem,
along with signal intensity change in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and/
or brainstem, particularly the midbrain.
Pantothenate kinase–associated neurodegeneration is a rare
autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder. Many patients have
alterations in pantothenate kinase 2 (PANK2) localized to mitochondria in neurons. The condition usually begins before 6 years of age
and is characterized by rapidly progressive dystonia, rigidity, and
choreoathetosis. Spasticity, extensor plantar responses, dysarthria,
and intellectual deterioration become evident during adolescence,
and death usually occurs by early adulthood. MRI shows lesions of
the globus pallidus, including low signal intensity in T2-­weighted
images (corresponding to iron pigments) and an anteromedial area
of high signal intensity (tissue necrosis and edema), or eye-­of-­the-­
tiger sign (Fig. 637.7). Neuropathologic examination indicates
excessive accumulation of iron-­containing pigments in the globus
pallidus and substantia nigra. Similar disorders of high brain iron
content without PANK2 gene alterations, including phospholipase

A2–associated neurodegeneration (PLAN), mitochondrial membrane protein–associated neurodegeneration (MPAN), beta-­propeller
protein–associated neurodegeneration (BPAN), neuroferritinopathy,
aceruloplasminemia, and others, have been grouped as disorders of
neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (Table 637.17).
Patterns of iron deposition visualized by brain MRI have shown utility in differentiating these disorders.
Biotin-­responsive basal ganglia disease manifests with episodes
of acute dystonia, external ophthalmoplegia, and encephalopathy.
SLC19A3 is the responsible mutated gene. MRI demonstrates involvement of the basal ganglia, with vasogenic edema and the bat-­wing sign
(Fig. 637.8). Treatment with biotin and thiamine results in improvement in 2-­4 days (Table 637.18).
Although dystonia may present in isolation as the first sign of a metabolic or neurodegenerative disorder, this group of diseases should be
considered mainly in those who demonstrate signs of systemic disease
(e.g., organomegaly, short stature, hearing loss, vision impairment, epilepsy) and those with episodes of severe illness, evidence of regression,
or cognitive impairment. Table 637.16 outlines additional features suggestive of specific disorders.

OTHER DISORDERS

Although uncommon, movement disorders, including dystonia, may
be part of the presenting symptoms of complex regional pain syndrome. Onset of involuntary movements within 1 year of the traumatic
event, an affected lower limb, pain disproportionate to the inciting
event, and changes in the overlying skin and blood flow to the affected
area suggest complex regional pain syndrome. Although sustained
dystonia can produce pain or discomfort, complex regional pain syndrome should be considered in those who have a prominent component of pain and a recent history of trauma to the affected limb.
Paroxysmal dyskinesias can cause a combination of dystonic posturing and choreoathetoid movements (Table 637.19). By far the most

common is paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD), which most
commonly presents around the age of 10 years with attacks of chorea
or dystonic posturing lasting seconds to minutes. The movements are
most commonly precipitated by voluntary movements and are often
easily controlled by low doses of carbamazepine or other antiepileptic
medications. Many patients have a gene alteration in PRRT2, a transmembrane protein that interacts with SNAP 25. Paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) is characterized by prolonged attacks
precipitated by emotional stress or alcohol rather than voluntary movement. The attacks are less frequent, perhaps a few times per year or less,
but they may last hours. PNKD is less responsive to treatment than
PKD. The rarest form of paroxysmal dyskinesia is exercise-­induced
dystonia. Dystonia in this disorder occurs after periods of prolonged
exercise and tends to last between 10 and 30 minutes. Patients may
also suffer from migraines and epilepsy. This disorder is caused by
gene alteration in SLC2A1, which encodes the glucose transporter
type 1 protein and is part of GLUT-­1 deficiency syndrome. Dystonia
may be present in classic GLUT-­1 deficiency, although it is generally
not the presenting sign. Case reports indicate some patients may have
improvement in dystonia with the ketogenic diet.
There are disorders unique to childhood that warrant exploration
in this section as well. Benign paroxysmal torticollis of infancy is

characterized by recurrent episodes of cervical dystonia beginning in
the first few months of life. The torticollis may alternate sides from one
episode to the next and may also persist during sleep. Associated signs
and symptoms include irritability, pallor, vomiting, vertigo, ataxia,
and occasionally limb dystonia. The family history is often notable for
migraine and/or motion sickness in first-­degree relatives. Despite the
high frequency of spells, imaging studies are normal, and the outcome
is uniformly benign with resolution by 3 years of age.
In alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC), episodic hemiplegia affecting either side of the body is the hallmark of the disorder. However, patients are also affected by episodes of dystonia, ranging from
minutes to days in duration. On average, both features of the disorder
commence at approximately 6 months of age. Episodic abnormal eye
movements are observed in a large proportion of patients (93%) with
onset as early as the first week of life. AHC is associated with pathogenic variants in ATP1A2 and ATP1A3. The disorder can be triggered

by fluctuations in temperature, certain foods, or water exposure. Over
time, epilepsy and cognitive impairment emerge, and the involuntary
movements change from episodic to constant. Infantile onset and the
paroxysmal nature of symptoms early in the disease course are key features to this diagnosis. Another disorder linked to variants in ATP1A3,
rapid-­onset dystonia parkinsonism (RODP), often presents in adolescents with acute to subacute progressive dystonia and bradykinesia,
often after a stressor such as recent illness. Although the classic forms
of these two disorders, AHC and RODP, are generally caused by nonoverlapping gene alterations, molecular genetics has allowed the identification of patients with intermediate phenotypes.
Although it is a diagnosis of exclusion, the presence of odd movements or selective disability may indicate a functional dystonia in
older children. There is considerable overlap in features of organic and
functional movement disorders, making the diagnosis difficult to
establish. Both organic and psychogenic movement disorders have the
potential to worsen in the setting of stress and may dissipate with relaxation or sleep. The history should include a review of recent stressors,
psychiatric symptoms, and exposure to others with similar disorders.
On examination, a changing movement disorder, inconsistent motor
or sensory exam, or response to suggestion is supportive of a possible
psychogenic movement disorder. Early recognition of this disorder
may lessen morbidity caused by unnecessary diagnostic and interventional procedures (see Table 637.13).
Practice guidance had once involved targeted, single-­gene testing; currently the most appropriate approach to a child with dystonia
not explained by a clear mechanism of injury will be a dystonia gene
sequencing panel, followed by a microarray and then whole exome
or genome sequencing if the panel was unrevealing. This includes
children previously diagnosed with cerebral palsy but without severe
perinatal distress and/or with injury solely confined to the basal ganglia on brain imaging. In families with a known history of a specific
genetic dystonia, single-­gene testing is the most appropriate initial
approach. Because dystonia panels may vary in which genes they
include, a knowledge of phenotypic features expected in various disorders can ensure that the dystonia panel selected is appropriate to
a given patient. An approach to diagnostic testing is noted in Table
637.20 and Figure 637.9.

an underlying known cause of dystonia, such as cerebral palsy. Infections and changes in medications are frequently cited triggers. In
addition, dystonic storm can also present in children with no prior
history of movement disorders secondary to neurologic insults such
as encephalitis or stroke. There are no consensus guidelines on treatment, but in general aggressive management with antidystonic agents
such as anticholinergics, trihexyphenidyl, benzodiazepines, and
baclofen is recommended. Midazolam infusion is generally chosen
when sedation is needed because of its muscle relaxing properties.
Intubation and other critical care supportive measures are commonly
needed during treatment.

Chronic Treatment

Treatment strategy is summarized in Table 637.18. Children with
Segawa syndrome and other neurotransmitter disorders generally have
a robust response to low-­dose carbidopa-­levodopa. The evidence for
efficacy in other causes of dystonia such as cerebral palsy is mixed.
However, because neurotransmitter disorders are underdiagnosed and
low-­dose carbidopa-­levodopa is generally well tolerated, a treatment
trial is recommended unless there is a clear family history of a non–
dopa-­responsive dystonia.
Children with generalized dystonia, including those with
involvement of the muscles of swallowing, may respond to the
anticholinergic agent trihexyphenidyl. Titration occurs slowly over
the course of months in an effort to limit untoward side effects,
such as urinary retention, mental confusion, or blurred vision. Oral
baclofen may also be used, although sedation may be a problem at
higher doses. Dopamine depletors may be considered in treatment-­
refractory cases. Additional drugs that may be effective include
benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and antiepileptic drugs such as
carbamazepine.

encephalopathies in children include infectious, toxic (carbon monoxide, drugs, lead), metabolic, genetic, and ischemic causes. Hypoxic-­
ischemic encephalopathy is discussed in Chapter 122.4.

Fig. 637.9 Algorithm showing therapeutic approaches to the man-

agement of childhood-­onset dystonia. Pharmacologic agents should
be used sparingly where possible. High doses and polypharmacy inevitably arise when dystonia is severe enough to cause pain and interferes
with daily cares, sitting comfort, and sleep. As with intractable epilepsy,
consideration for functional neurosurgery should be considered when
two or more drugs have failed to control dystonia. (From Lin JP. Advances in pharmacotherapies for movement disorders in children: current
limitations and future progress. Curr Opin Pediatr. 2017;29:652–664,
Fig. 6.)

Oral medications are not the only options for treatment. Segmental dystonia, such as torticollis, often responds well to botulinum toxin
injections. Safe dosage restrictions limit the use of botulinum toxin in
generalized dystonia, but it may be used as a supplemental treatment
if symptoms in particular muscle groups are the most bothersome or
functionally impairing.
Intrathecal baclofen delivered through an implantable constant-­
infusion pump may be helpful in some patients. It is often more effective in the lower extremities than the upper extremities.
Deep brain stimulation with leads implanted in the globus pallidus
is most helpful for children with severe primary generalized dystonia.
Deep brain stimulation may also be of benefit in children with secondary dystonias, such as cerebral palsy, although the effect is not as robust.
A combination of factors are thought to reduce the efficacy in cerebral
palsy, including a lack of normal neural substrate, reduced opportunity
for motor learning during critical developmental windows, and the frequent presence of other neurologic impairments such as spasticity and
weakness. It should only be considered if a trial of two to three oral
agents has been unsuccessful.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is a complex and heterogeneous disorder denoting a group of permanent motor conditions that cause physical disability in human development, chiefly in the various areas of body
movement. It can be defined as a central motor dysfunction affecting
muscle tone, posture, and movement that is attributed to nonprogressive disturbances in the developing fetal or infant brain. Despite being
described as a nonprogressive disorder (historically referred to as static
encephalopathy by some), the clinical expression of brain injury or
insult changes over time. Therefore the condition should be viewed as
a dynamic disorder that evolves because of factors such as growth, nervous system maturation, and aging.
Several classification systems are used to describe CP, which
reflects the complexity underlying the heterogeneity of cause, distribution, type of motor involvement, and severity. Consideration of
associated manifestations such as cognitive deficits, seizures, communication difficulties, visual impairment, and so on, as well as
addressing the medical, surgical, and psychosocial needs requires a
multidisciplinary approach.

EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY

Cerebral palsy is the most common neuromotor disorder in childhood, with an overall incidence of 2.6-­2.9 cases per 1,000 live
births in the United States. Within developed countries, both cross-­
sectional and cohort-­based studies estimate prevalence of CP as
nearly 1-­4 per 1,000 live births. In developing countries, available
estimates of prevalence are similar. The estimated lifetime cost to
care for someone with CP in 2003, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was $1 million. Adjusting for
inflation, this is now $1.2 million per individual and will continue
to increase over time.
CP is caused by a broad group of developmental, genetic, metabolic,
ischemic, infectious, and other etiologies that produce a common
group of neurologic phenotypes. Thus CP should be based on phenotype rather than etiology. The prevalence of CP is higher for children born preterm or at a low birthweight, though this is influenced
by sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. There is a 30–40% greater
prevalence in males. Prevalence is higher in low-­and middle-­versus

Chapter 638 u Encephalopathies
high-­income communities. Rates of CP have only recently begun to
decrease in developed countries, though direct interpretation of trends
is complicated by changing patterns of neonatal care and survivorhood.
Although overall prevalence has fluctuated, the specific etiologies and
injury patterns have shifted over time given advances in perinatal and
neonatal management.
In addition to prematurity and birthweight, numerous other prenatal and perinatal risk factors have been reported, though for many of
these, a causal relationship has not been established. These risk factors
include antenatal infection (chorioamnionitis, urinary tract infection),
multiple pregnancy, and neonatal infection. Infertility treatments are
also associated with a higher rate of CP, probably because these treatments are often associated with multiple pregnancies. CP is most often
multifactorial, and multiple risk factors coexist.
The cerebral disruption associated with CP can occur prenatally,
perinatally, or postnatally in the first 2 years of life given that brain
development is ongoing during this critical period. Congenital CP (due
to cerebral injury/maldevelopment before or during birth) accounts
for 85–90% of total cases, whereas acquired CP (due to cerebral injury
after 1 month of life) is responsible for the remaining cases.
One can also consider different etiologies based on premature versus term births. The major lesions that contribute to CP in preterm
infants are intracerebral hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). Although the incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage
has declined significantly, PVL remains a major problem. The incidence of cystic PVL caused by a more diffuse injury pattern is being
replaced by focal necrosis. PVL reflects the enhanced vulnerability
of immature oligodendroglia in premature infants to oxidative stress
caused by ischemia or infectious/inflammatory insults. White matter
abnormalities (loss of volume of periventricular white matter, extent
of cystic changes, ventricular dilation, thinning of the corpus callosum) present on MRI at 40 weeks of gestational age in former preterm
infants are a predictor of later CP. MRI with diffusion tensor imaging
is being used to map white matter tracts more precisely in patients
with spastic diplegia, and this technique has shown that thalamocortical sensory pathways are often injured as severely as motor corticospinal pathways (Fig. 638.1).
Lateral

In term births, causes historically have primarily been thought to be
by events during labor and delivery causing hypoxia. The mechanisms
are predominately the result of cerebral ischemia and excitotoxicity.
The cause can be obvious (i.e., placental abruption, meconium aspiration), though at other times the etiology can be difficult to pinpoint.
Risk factors can include eclampsia, hypercoagulability, and placental
pathology. For some, no predisposing clinical factors are identified.
Hypoxic-­ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) may be decreasing as an
apparent cause of CP in developed countries. Therapeutic hypothermia
may reduce the risk of CP in term patients with HIE.
There are several causes of acquired CP. The most common cause in
this category is perinatal stroke, which can be ischemic, hemorrhagic,
or thromboembolic in nature. The second most common cause is meningitis or encephalitis during infancy. Kernicterus is a rare cause of
CP in developed countries, though cases (particularly in very preterm
infants) persist.
Cryptogenic CP traditionally refers to an individual in which no
clear perinatal etiology has been identified and accounts for ∼30% of
cases. Chromosomal copy number variants and single gene disorders
have been identified in ∼30% of patients with CP. Monogenic genetic
variants have been identified in ∼30% of cases who met diagnostic criteria for CP. A wide range of genes have been implicated in CP phenotypes, though a few are relatively more frequently seen including
TUBA1A, TUBB4A, COL4A1, SPAST, CTNNB1, GNAO1, STXBP1,
and KIF1A. Factors associated with exome sequencing–identified gene
variants include patients without a perinatal risk factor, those with a
positive family history, and patients with intellectual disability, epilepsy, or autism spectrum disorders.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

There are several classification systems to describe CP, a reflection of
the complexity underlying the heterogeneity of cause, distribution,
type of motor involvement, and severity (Table 638.1). Classification
aids in understanding cause, coordinating care, monitoring comorbidities, treatment offerings and their prognosis, and long-­term outcomes. One such classification system starts by determining the type of
motor involvement: spastic or extrapyramidal. Spastic CP can then be

further truncated topographically (Fig. 638.2), whereas extrapyramidal is further categorized based on the type of involuntary movement
seen. In extrapyramidal CP, the brain injury or insult spares the pyramidal tracts that cause spasticity resulting in disorders of movement,
coordination, and balance. Clinically, these patients exhibit dystonia
and/or choreoathetosis (collectively referred to as dyskinetic) or ataxia
associated with lesions in the cerebellum or its connections. Spastic CP
accounts for 80% of cases, whereas extrapyramidal makes up 20% of
cases (15% dyskinetic and 5% ataxic).
Historically, CP has been classified as mild, moderate, and severe
without specified criteria for each group and primarily used for diagnostic purposes. The Gross Motor Function Classification System
(GMFCS) was developed to categorize CP based on abilities and limitations in motor functioning. Goals included improved communication
for treatment decisions, research into treatment outcomes, improved
understanding and communication of the development of a child with
CP, and anticipated future ambulatory needs. The emphasis is on usual
rather than best motor performance in a variety of settings: home,
school, and community.
Spastic hemiplegia has decreased spontaneous movements on the
affected side and shows hand (handedness) preference at a very early
age. The arm is often more involved than the leg, and difficulty in hand
manipulation is evident by 1 year of age. Walking is usually delayed
until 18-­24 months, and a circumductive gait is apparent. Examination of the extremities may show growth arrest leading to shortened
limbs and decreased muscle bulk on the affected side. Spasticity refers
to the quality of increased muscle tone, which increases with the speed
of passive muscle stretching and is greatest in antigravity muscles. It is
apparent in the affected extremities, particularly at the ankle, causing
an equinovarus deformity of the foot. An affected child often walks
on tiptoe (toe-­walking) because of the increased tone in the antigravity gastrocnemius muscles and tight contracted Achilles tendon; the
affected upper extremity assumes a flexed posture when the child runs.
Ankle clonus and a Babinski sign may be present, the deep tendon
reflexes are increased, and weakness of the hand and foot dorsiflexors
is evident. Difficulty in selective motor control is also present.
Spastic monoplegia is when only one limb is affected and may
not be as obvious as other types of CP. Depending on which limb is
affected, the child’s motor disability ranges from challenges with either
fine or gross motor skills. A monoplegia that affects the arm may result
in challenges with bimanual tasks, whereas when the legs are involved,
toe walking may be seen.
Spastic diplegia is bilateral spasticity of the legs that is greater than
in the arms. Spastic diplegia is strongly associated with injury to the
immature white matter during the vulnerable period of immature

oligodendroglia between 20 and 34 weeks of gestation, hence seen in
those born prematurely. The first clinical indication of spastic diplegia is often noted when an affected infant begins to crawl. The child
uses the arms in a normal reciprocal fashion but tends to drag the legs
behind more as a rudder (commando crawl) rather than using the normal four-­limbed crawling movement. If the spasticity is severe, application of a diaper is difficult because of the excessive adduction of the
hips. Examination of the child reveals symmetric spasticity in the legs
with brisk reflexes, ankle clonus, and a bilateral Babinski sign. When
the child is suspended by the axillae, an extended scissoring posture
of the lower extremities is maintained. Walking can be significantly
delayed, the feet are held in a position of equinovarus, and the child
walks on tiptoes. Severe spastic diplegia is characterized by disuse atrophy, impaired growth of the lower extremities, and disproportionate
growth with normal development of the upper torso.
Spastic quadriplegia is the most severe form of CP because of
marked motor impairment of all extremities and the high association
with other comorbidities, including intellectual disabilities, seizure
disorders, communication and visual impairment, and feeding difficulties. Swallowing difficulties are common as a result of supranuclear
bulbar palsies, often leading to aspiration pneumonia and growth failure. Neurologic examination shows increased tone and spasticity in
all extremities, decreased spontaneous movements, brisk reflexes, and
plantar extensor responses. Flexion contractures of the knees, elbows,
and wrists are often present by late childhood. Children with spastic
quadriparesis can also have extrapyramidal findings given the diffuse
involvement of the brain injury.
Extrapyramidal CP can be divided into the two main types of
involuntary movement seen: ataxia and dyskinesias. In this type of CP,
injury is typically to the subcortical areas, which are centers for coordination in movement and balance. Injury may not produce weakness,
but rather the inability to voluntarily control movements. This type is
less common than spastic CP and makes up approximately 15–20% of
patients with CP.
Ataxic CP is the rarest form whose clinical picture is variable ranging from hypotonia to mild spasticity in addition to incoordination
depending on the other systems involved. Walking gait is often very
wide and sometimes irregular. Control of eye movements and depth
perception can be impaired. Often, fine motor skills requiring coordination of the eyes and hands, such as writing, are difficult. Other
causes of ataxia in infancy and childhood, including hydrocephalus,
neoplasms, and degenerative disorders, should be ruled out before CP
is diagnosed (see Chapter 637.1).
Dyskinetic CP is further divided into two groups: athetoid and
dystonic. Athetoid CP includes cases with involuntary movement,

Nearly all individuals with CP will have one or more medical, neurologic, or psychiatric comorbidities. Neuropsychiatric comorbidities
that occur at higher rates with CP include intellectual disability, anxiety, depression, and attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
compared with the general population. Other associated comorbidities are common and include chronic pain, sleep difficulties, urinary
dysfunction, decreased bone health, sialorrhea, respiratory disorders,
feeding and growth challenges, gastrointestinal disorders including constipation and dysmotility, speech/communication difficulties,
visual impairment, and hearing loss.

cerebral palsy accounts for 70–80% of cases and is caused by an injury of the pyramidal tracts affecting voluntary movement. Monoplegia
and hemiplegia affect one side of the body; in monoplegia one limb
is affected, whereas in hemiplegia both the arm and leg on one side
are affected. Hemiplegia can be asymmetric, affecting the arm or leg
greater than the other extremity. Diplegia, triplegia, and quadriplegia
affect both sides of the body. In diplegia, the predominant picture is involvement of the lower extremities. However, the arms can be affected
though not to the same degree. In triplegia, both lower extremities and
one arm are affected. A common picture is diplegia from periventricular
leukomalacia and hemiplegia from an interventricular hemorrhage. This
results in one lower extremity being more severely affected because of

especially in the arms, legs, and hands. With the current management
of Rh and ABO incompatibility, the incidence of CP characterized by
athetosis has markedly decreased (see Chapter 637). Athetoid CP is
often caused by kernicterus secondary to high levels of bilirubin, and
in this case the MRI scan shows lesions in the globus pallidus bilaterally, or it may be normal. Cases are still seen as a result of HIE as well.
The affected infant is initially hypotonic, but a tendency toward arching and opisthotonus (dystonia) is noted, and obligatory tonic neck
reflexes are present. These primitive motor patterns preclude orderly
motor development such as reaching, rolling, and sitting. Dystonic CP
encompasses cases that affect the trunk muscles more than the limbs
and results in a fixed, twisted posture. Toward the end of the first year,
repetitive, involuntary movements become more consistent with the
full-­blown picture of dystonic CP. Dystonia in CP presents as hypertonia, involuntary postures and movements, or a combination.

CP is a clinical diagnosis that considers elements from the history,
physical examination, and ancillary testing including neuroimaging.
The history should focus on whether there was perinatal or postnatal
injury to the brain, what factors led to this injury, and contributory
pregnancy factors. Another important factor is the developmental trajectory. It is important to quantify rates of development in the various domains and whether that trajectory has been one of continued
acquisition of skills, plateauing, or regression. This—especially no loss
of acquired milestones (regression)—helps preclude a progressive disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), including degenerative diseases, metabolic disorders, spinal cord tumor, or muscular dystrophy.
Multiple components to the physical examination are necessary to characterize abnormalities of tone, reflexes, movements, posture, and balance
that may be consistent with the diagnosis of CP. The physical examination should focus on the following features: presence of any limb deformities, curvature of the spine, range of motion of joints, muscle tone, muscle
strength, reflexes, presence of any movement disorders, and gait.
An MRI scan of the brain is indicated to determine the location and
extent of structural lesions or associated congenital malformations; an
MRI scan of the spinal cord is indicated if there is any question about spinal
cord pathology. An MRI with abnormalities consistent with CP supports
the diagnosis and increases the level of certainty, but the diagnosis remains
a clinical one. An early diagnosis of CP is desirable to initiate appropriate
services and therapies and to provide a definitive diagnosis for families.
Additional studies may include tests of hearing and visual function. Genetic
evaluation should be considered in patients with congenital malformations,
evidence of metabolic disorders (e.g., amino acids, organic acids, MR spectroscopy), clinical features atypical of CP, or when there are no perinatal risk factors
especially in term infants (Fig. 638.3, Tables 638.2 and 638.3).
The differential diagnosis must include disorders that may mimic the
various types of CP (see Fig. 638.3). These may include the hereditary
spastic diplegias (Table 638.4), monoamine transmitter disorders such as
dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)-­responsive dystonia (Segawa disease)
(Table 638.5 and Fig. 638.4), and many treatable inborn errors of metabolism, including disorders of amino acids, creatine, fatty acid oxidation,
lysosomes, mitochondria, organic acids, and vitamin cofactors.

TREATMENT

The treatment strategy for CP is best developed in a multidisciplinary
patient-­centered setting, where medical interventions are embedded in
a rehabilitation context considering the patient’s individual goals (see
Chapter 752). The overarching goal for patients with CP is to maximize
functioning by improved biomechanics resulting from abnormal tone,
musculoskeletal deformities, and muscle weakness. Other goals outside
of those related to the neuromotor component can be equally important
when they pertain to quality of life, comfort, and social stigmatization.
Clear communication and coordination among the multidisciplinary
team (physiatry, orthopedic, neurology/neurodevelopmentalists, neurosurgery) as well as physical and occupational therapy, speech pathology, social work, primary care physicians, developmental pediatricians,
and educators maximize the chances of success.
Parents should be taught how to work with their child in daily activities such as feeding, carrying, dressing, bathing, and playing in ways that
reduce the effects of abnormal muscle tone. Families and children also
need to be instructed in the performance of a series of exercises designed
to promote developmental progress, prevent long-­term complications
such as the development of contractures, preserve range of motion,

sometimes relieve pain. Additional equipment needs address activities of
daily living such as bathing and hygiene, communication, and driving.
Pharmacotherapy is often the first-­line approach used to manage
the various tone abnormalities seen in CP and includes both enteral
options and targeted injections. Systemic medications are often chosen for more widespread management of spasticity and dyskinesias.
Although baclofen is routinely favored, other antispasticity medications such as tizanidine, dantrolene, and benzodiazepines are also
available. Second-­line medications such as clonidine or gabapentin
may provide dual benefit for both tone management and other neurologic associations, including sleep disruption, dysautonomia, pain, and
neuroirritability. Medications used to treat dystonia include enteral
baclofen, benzodiazepines, trihexyphenidyl, clonidine, dantrolene,
levodopamine, and gabapentin, but practice varies widely. Tetrabenazine can be useful for hyperkinetic movement disorders, including athetosis or chorea.
The management of focal/segmental spasticity or dystonia includes
chemodenervation agents that target these specific locations. Targeted injections are often used in combination with systemic medications to augment tone management in specific areas that are more
problematic. Examples include botulinum toxin A (BoNT-­A), phenol, and ethyl alcohol. Targeted injections combined with rehabilitative therapies can allow for improved motor functioning and delay
or avoid orthopedic surgery; these injections require repeat administration. Typically repeat injections are performed every 4-­6 months,
primarily to avoid the development of resistance; 3 months may be
necessary. Injections into salivary glands may also help reduce the
severity of drooling if it is not adequately treated with anticholinergic
agents.
Neurosurgical options include intrathecal baclofen (ITB), selective
dorsal rhizotomy (SDR), and deep brain stimulation (DBS). ITB can be
considered in patients whose spasticity is not adequately treated with
enteral baclofen or who are experiencing side effects such as sedation,

weakness, or gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Baclofen is delivered
with an implanted pump in children with severe spasticity; it is useful
because it delivers the drug directly around the spinal cord, where it
reduces neurotransmission of afferent nerve fibers. Direct delivery to
the spinal cord overcomes the problem of CNS side effects caused by
the large oral doses needed to penetrate the blood-­brain barrier. ITB
may reduce dystonia with evidence for benefit with higher catheter
placement.
The main goal of SDR is to improve the gait or functioning in those
that function at GMFCS I-­III with good selective motor control and
minimal weakness. However, SDR is being looked at for management of tone, minimizing pain, and ease of caregiving in patients
functioning on a GMFCS IV-­V level. Because SDR is an irreversible
treatment for spasticity, optimal selection of ideal candidates from
a multidisciplinary approach is necessary to avoid short-­and long-­
term complications. SDR’s spasticity benefits are caused by a partial
sensory deafferentation of the spinal cord. This is achieved by resection of dorsal nerve rootlets based on abnormal motor responses to
electrical stimulation (Fig. 638.5). The total number of nerve rootlets resected ranges from 25% to 40%, though in some institutions
it exceeds >40%. Combining both ventral and dorsal rhizotomies
can help manage both spasticity and dystonia. SDR manages lower
extremity tone equally as the ITB pump, may provide more upper-­
extremity tone control compared with the ITB pump, and improves
bladder function.
DBS can be considered if there is severe hypertonia with combined spasticity and dystonia. DBS is a neurosurgical procedure that
evolved from the recognition that pallidotomies and thalamotomies
could help patients with medically refractory dystonia. It involves
the introduction of stimulating electrodes in areas of the brain such
as the globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus, which are connected to an extracranial pulse generator (see Chapter 637). After
the surgical procedure, the beneficial effects are not immediately

visible, often taking several months. The procedure is associated
with perioperative risks as well as infection and hardware complications. Therefore patient selection and consideration of the appropriate target for stimulation for DBS are key. Most agree that the
presence of spasticity, contractures/deformities, and myelopathy
are poor predictors of response and that neurosurgical expertise,
anatomic factors, and severity/time of dystonic symptoms may
influence response.
Orthopedic interventions address musculoskeletal pathology, including fixed muscle contractures, torsion of long bones,
hip displacement, and spine deformities. Several surgical methods exist for lengthening the muscle-­tendon units for contraction
management, though these are rarely necessary before 6 years of
age. Before this, prevention of contracture development is key
and often is a combination of tone management, bracing, and
stretching exercises. Femoral and tibial torsion occur, respectively,
because of failure of remodeling fetal anteversion and mostly as
a response to abnormal biomechanical forces during walking.
Derotational osteotomies are ideally performed between 6 and
12 years of age. With increasing GMFCS level comes increased
risk of developing hip displacement and neuromuscular scoliosis.
Monitoring and prevention strategies are paramount, as both hip
displacement and scoliosis may progress with age. Conservative
treatment and surgical approaches can be challenging when balancing the complexity of these surgical interventions and outcome
goals defined presurgically.

638.2 Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathies
Shamima Rahman
Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies are complex neurologic disorders caused by disturbed mitochondrial function. Mitochondria are
dynamic cellular organelles with multitudinous roles, most notably
energy generation via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), but
other mitochondrial functions include intermediary metabolism (the
Krebs cycle, fatty acid beta oxidation, and part of the urea cycle are
housed in the mitochondrion), calcium homeostasis, intracellular signaling, apoptosis, and biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10, heme, iron-­sulfur

clusters, and lipoic acid. Aberrant mitochondrial function most commonly involves disturbed energy generation via the OXPHOS system,
but other mechanisms include oxidative stress mediated by increased
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), alterations of other metabolic processes within the mitochondria (such as pyruvate dehydrogenase, the Krebs cycle, vitamin metabolism and transport, and cofactor
biosynthesis) and of the mitochondrial lipid membranes, protein quality control, import system, and organelle dynamics (disturbed fission
and fusion).
Mitochondria are unique among cellular organelles in that they
contain their own genome: the maternally inherited circular mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecule comprising 16,569 base pairs in
humans encoding 37 genes: 13 protein-­coding genes, 22 transfer RNAs
(tRNAs), and 2 ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). The mitochondrial genome
is present in multiple copies within each mitochondrion, and there
are hundreds to thousands of mtDNA molecules per cell. mtDNA
gene variants may be heteroplasmic (only a percentage of the mtDNA
is mutated) or homoplasmic (100% of the mtDNA is mutated). Primary mitochondrial disease may be caused by maternally inherited
or sporadic variants affecting the mtDNA or by recessive, dominant,
X-­linked, or de novo variants in nearly 400 nuclear genes involved in
mitochondrial function and structure.
Mitochondrial disorders, especially those presenting in childhood,
have a predilection for high-­energy-­consuming organs: the brain, skeletal muscle, eyes, ears, heart, kidneys, and liver. Neurologic features of
primary mitochondrial disease in childhood include hypotonia, dystonia, spasticity, ptosis, progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO), seizures, and ataxia. Multisystem features that may be observed in children
with mitochondrial disease are illustrated in Figure 638.6. Some mitochondrial syndromes with characteristic constellations of symptoms
and signs were recognized many decades before their genetic basis was
understood; several of these syndromes are summarized in Table 638.6.
Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies can be considered according
to age at onset of symptoms. In early infancy the most frequent presentations include Leigh syndrome, the mtDNA depletion syndromes
(MDDS), disorders of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) biosynthesis, and reversible infantile respiratory chain disease (RIRCD). Clinical syndromes
observed later in childhood include Kearns-­Sayre syndrome (KSS),
mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and strokelike episodes (MELAS), myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers
(MERRF), and neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP). However, many children presenting with mitochondrial disease have overlapping features not specific to an individual

such as an epileptic encephalopathy, leukoencephalopathy, myopathy,
or isolated optic atrophy.

LEIGH SYNDROME

Leigh syndrome, or subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy, is a
clinical syndrome of neurodevelopmental delay and/or regression and
variable other neurologic features, including dystonia, hypotonia, spasticity, ataxia, and seizures, with characteristic MRI brain appearances
and biochemical evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction. Peak onset is
usually in the first 2 years of life (mean 7 months), although longer surviving cases and adult onset are both recognized. Initial symptoms may
be nonneurologic, including feeding difficulties, vomiting, and poor
weight gain in infancy. Eye involvement is a frequent finding, including
nystagmus, ptosis, PEO, optic atrophy, and retinitis pigmentosa. MRI
reveals bilateral, usually symmetric T2-­weighted hyperintense lesions
variably affecting the basal ganglia, thalamus, midbrain, and brainstem
structures (Fig. 638.7). These imaging lesions reflect the neuropathology, which consists of spongiform lesions with cavitation, neuronal
loss, demyelination, and capillary proliferation.
Biochemical features are variable in Leigh syndrome and include
elevated lactate in blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and isolated
or combined deficiency of one or more OXPHOS enzymes. Normal
biochemical findings do not exclude the diagnosis. Leigh syndrome
is genetically heterogeneous, and more than 100 monogenic causes
have been identified, including variants in both mtDNA-­
encoded

genes (responsible for 25–30% of cases) and nuclear genes. Modes of
inheritance include maternal (for mtDNA variants), autosomal recessive, X-­linked, and de novo dominant. MEGDEL (3-­methylglutaconic
aciduria with deafness and encephalopathy, Leigh-­like) syndrome is
a subtype of Leigh syndrome caused by biallelic variants in SERAC1
encoding a protein involved in remodeling mitochondrial membrane
lipids. Affected infants typically fail the newborn hearing screen and
have problems with hypoglycemia and hyperammonemia related to
hepatic dysfunction. Some infants succumb to liver failure, but hepatic
function improves in most affected individuals, who later progress to
a neurodegenerative course with prominent dystonia and loss of skills.
A few causes of Leigh syndrome are potentially treatable. These
include deficiencies of biotinidase (an enzyme required for biotin
recycling within the cell), the thiamine transporter SLC19A3 (also
associated with biotin-­
thiamine–responsive basal ganglia disease),
and proteins required for biosynthesis of CoQ10, a mobile electron carrier in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. All other forms of Leigh
syndrome have no curative treatments and are associated with a progressive neurodegenerative course with early death, usually caused by
respiratory failure secondary to brainstem lesions affecting the respiratory center. Median age at death was reported as 2.4 years in one
cohort, but this is variable and related to the underlying genetic cause.
Longer survival has been reported in some forms of Leigh syndrome,
including MEGDEL and deficiencies of SURF1 (an assembly factor
for OXPHOS complex IV) and SUCLA2 (a subunit of the Krebs cycle
enzyme succinyl-­CoA ligase).

the left basal ganglia at a period of clinical exacerbation caused by febrile illness demonstrates a dramatic elevation of lactate compared with her
routinely observed levels as shown in axial T2-­weighted (D), short echo MRS (E), and long echo MRS (F) images. The spectra acquired 3 mo later
demonstrate a significant reduction in lactate. A comparison of the imaging data is unremarkable between the examinations. The dramatic elevation
of lactate revealed on MRS in (B) and (C) corresponds to worsening clinical symptoms (seizures and leg stiffening). The lactate levels observed in

MITOCHONDRIAL DNA DEPLETION SYNDROMES

The most prevalent MDDS is Alpers-­Huttenlocher syndrome (progressive neuronal degeneration of childhood with epilepsy, PNDE)
caused by recessively inherited gene variants in POLG encoding the
catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase γ, the polymerase responsible for
replicating the mtDNA. Affected individuals frequently present with
intractable epilepsy, particularly epilepsia partialis continua, around
12 months of age. A characteristic EEG finding in the early stages of
the disease is rhythmic high amplitude with delta spikes (RHADS).

Repeated episodes of status epilepticus frequently lead to a median
age of death of around 16 months (there is typically a median of 4
months between presentation with seizures and death). Sodium valproate is absolutely contraindicated in Alpers-­Huttenlocher syndrome
and other presentations of POLG disease because exposure to valproate
may trigger fatal hepatic failure.
Recessive pathologic variants of at least 12 genes have been linked to
infantile-­and childhood-­onset MDDS (Table 638.7). There is often a
period of normal development lasting weeks to months before clinical

manifestations become apparent. Associated organ involvement may
provide a clue to the underlying genetic diagnosis: sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and methylmalonic aciduria occur in SUCLA2 defects,
SNHL and renal tubular involvement in RRM2B defects, and hepatic
involvement is associated with DGUOK, MPV17, POLG, TWNK,
TFAM, and SUCLG1 gene variants. Thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) deficiency appears to be a special case because this disorder leads to a pure
myopathic presentation in most affected cases. Clinical response to
nucleoside supplementation has been reported for TK2 deficiency but
not for any other form of MDDS.

DISORDERS OF COENZYME Q10 BIOSYNTHESIS

CoQ10 functions as a mobile electron carrier and antioxidant in the
mitochondrial inner membrane. CoQ10 is synthesized by a complex
biosynthetic pathway, 10 defects of which have been linked to human
disease. Clinical presentations of these recessive disorders include
an infantile encephalomyopathy with prominent seizures and dystonia variably associated with multisystem features: SNHL, optic
atrophy, pigmentary retinopathy, cardiomyopathy, and renal disease.
Other presentations include ataxia, myopathy, and steroid-­resistant
nephrotic syndrome. Affected patients should be treated with high-­
dose CoQ10 supplementation, although clinical response is variable.

REVERSIBLE INFANTILE RESPIRATORY CHAIN
DEFICIENCY

RIRCD, also known as benign reversible mitochondrial myopathy, typically presents after a period of normal development lasting 3-­6 weeks
with profound lactic acidosis and progressive muscle weakness, often
leading to a need for enteral tube feeding and, in some cases where
the respiratory muscles are severely affected, artificial ventilation.
A ventilatory requirement may persist for up to 18 months. Muscle
biopsy reveals ragged red and cytochrome c oxidase negative fibers
with multiple OXPHOS enzyme deficiencies on spectrophotometric
assay. This condition is linked to two homoplasmic variants at the same
nucleotide in mtDNA: m.14674T>G and m.14674T>C. Although all
maternally related individuals are homoplasmic for the variant, only
a small proportion are clinically affected. Studies have also identified potential modifying variants in several nuclear-­encoded genes
involved in mitochondrial translation, particularly EARS2. Spontaneous recovery of muscle strength is associated with excellent neurodevelopmental outcomes. Because it is not possible to distinguish RIRCD

from fatal infantile mitochondrial myopathies, rapid testing for the
m.14674T>G/C variants is recommended in all infants presenting with
severe muscle weakness and lactic acidosis, so that ventilatory support
can be provided to affected infants if needed.
Another form of RIRCD is a reversible hepatopathy caused by recessive variants in the TRMU gene encoding a protein required to modify
mitochondrial tRNAs. Affected infants present with acute liver failure,
variably associated with encephalomyopathic features.

KEARNS-­SAYRE SYNDROME

KSS is defined by a clinical triad of PEO, pigmentary retinopathy, and
heart block, with age of onset <20 years. Other neurologic features
include cerebellar ataxia, elevated CSF protein levels, progressive
myopathy, and cognitive decline. A peculiar feature of KSS is white
matter disease associated with cerebral folate deficiency. Low levels
of CSF 5-­methyltetrahydrofolate (5-­MTHF) and clinical response
to folinic acid supplementation have been documented in some
patients. Variable associated multisystem disease features include
SNHL, renal tubulopathy, endocrine dysfunction (diabetes mellitus,
hypoparathyroidism, and short stature with growth hormone deficiency in some cases), and cardiomyopathy. KSS is usually a sporadic
condition caused by single large-­scale mtDNA deletions (SLSMDs);
many individuals have a common 4.9kb mtDNA deletion. SLSMDs
are associated with a continuous clinical spectrum ranging from
infantile-­onset Pearson syndrome to adult-­onset isolated PEO without systemic features.

MITOCHONDRIAL ENCEPHALOMYOPATHY WITH
LACTIC ACIDOSIS AND STROKELIKE EPISODES

MELAS is a maternally inherited disorder that typically presents
toward the end of the first decade with migraine headache, vomiting,
and seizures, which may lead to a strokelike episode. MRI of the brain
reveals focal lesions with a parieto-­occipital predilection not confined
to a vascular territory (Fig. 638.8). Other clinical features include
hemianopia during the strokelike episodes, ptosis, optic atrophy, pigmentary retinopathy, SNHL, exercise intolerance, cognitive decline, GI
dysmotility, cardiomyopathy, renal impairment, and diabetes mellitus.
Eighty percent of cases have a common maternally inherited mtDNA
gene variant m.3243A>G in the MT-­TL1 gene encoding a tRNA for
leucine. This gene variant is present in 1 in 400 of the general population, yet MELAS is a rare disorder. Most individuals harboring the

Chapter 638 u Encephalopathies
m.3243A>G variant are asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic or have
non-­MELAS presentations, including maternally inherited diabetes
and deafness (MIDD), cardiomyopathy, sudden unexpected death, or
isolated renal involvement (focal segmental glomerulosclerosis). Other
causes of MELAS include other mtDNA variants, particularly in the
MT-­TL1 gene or in mtDNA-­encoded subunits of complex I (especially
ND5), and occasionally POLG disease can mimic MELAS.

MYOCLONIC EPILEPSY WITH RAGGED RED FIBERS

MERRF is a maternally inherited syndrome characterized by progressive myoclonic epilepsy and cerebellar ataxia with nystagmus and
dysarthria. Onset may be in late childhood or adult life, and the disorder may be rapidly progressive or have a more indolent course. Other
neurologic features include other seizure types, spasticity, peripheral
neuropathy, SNHL, ptosis, PEO, optic atrophy, cognitive decline, and
psychiatric manifestations. MERRF can also mimic MELAS, including strokelike episodes. MERRF is typically a multisystemic disorder;
extraneurologic features include multiple symmetric lipomatosis,
endocrine disturbance (growth hormone deficiency, hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), and cardiomyopathy. A common mtDNA
pathologic variant, m.8344A>G in the MT-­TK gene encoding the
tRNA for lysine, accounts for 80% of cases of MERRF. Patients with
a very high percentage of this variant (typically >90%) present with
Leigh syndrome in infancy. The remaining patients with MERRF
have other mtDNA tRNA gene variants; occasionally POLG disease
may mimic MERRF.

NEUROGENIC MUSCLE WEAKNESS, ATAXIA, AND
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA

NARP is a maternally inherited disorder caused by a relatively common mtDNA gene variant, m.8993T>G, in the MT-­ATP6 gene encoding the ATP6 subunit of ATP synthase (OXPHOS complex V). Patients
usually have a gene variant load of ∼70%, but those with a higher variant load (typically >90%) of the same variant present with maternally
inherited Leigh syndrome. Clinical presentation of NARP is usually
in late childhood or early adult life with numbness and paresthesias
caused by the sensory neuropathy associated with muscle weakness
and ataxia. Retinitis pigmentosa initially causes poor night vision and
progresses slowly to severe visual loss. Other clinical features include
developmental delay, learning disability, dementia, seizures, SNHL,
diabetes mellitus, and cardiac conduction defects. MT-­ATP6 variants
have also been reported to cause axonal Charcot-­Marie-­Tooth disease
without CNS or other features.

MITOCHONDRIAL NEUROGASTROINTESTINAL
ENCEPHALOMYOPATHY

Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is
a late-­onset MDDS characterized by widespread demyelinating polyneuropathy leading to predominant GI symptoms and peripheral neuropathy with a relatively asymptomatic leukoencephalopathy. Onset
of symptoms is usually toward the end of the second decade, but presentation in early childhood may occur. Major symptoms relate to GI
dysmotility and pseudo-obstruction (nausea, vomiting, early satiety,
abdominal pain, diarrhea) leading to severe weight loss and cachexia.
Other clinical features include ptosis, PEO, SNHL, painful paresthesias, and foot drop. The disorder is caused by recessive variants in the
TYMP gene encoding thymidine phosphorylase, a cytosolic enzyme
whose function is essential to the maintenance of intramitochondrial
nucleotide pools. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell or liver transplantation may be beneficial if performed early in the disease course.

JUVENILE POLG SYNDROMES

POLG variants may also present in later childhood or adult life with
a range of clinical presentations, including PEO, proximal or distal
myopathy, and juvenile and adult-­onset epilepsy syndromes. Myoclonic epilepsy, myopathy, and sensory ataxia (MEMSA), incorporating an entity previously known as spinocerebellar ataxia with epilepsy
(SCAE), typically presents with cerebellar ataxia in adolescence or
young adult life, with later development of epilepsy. The seizures are

3699

focal initially, often affecting the right hand. Later they become generalized, including epilepsia partialis continua (EPC), and are refractory
to therapy. The ataxia neuropathy spectrum (ANS) is characterized by
ataxia and neuropathy and includes the previous acronyms MIRAS
(mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome) and SANDO (sensory
ataxia, neuropathy, dysarthria, ophthalmoplegia). ANS also frequently
leads to an encephalopathy with seizures, so there is some overlap
between MEMSA and ANS. POLG disease may also mimic MELAS,
MERRF, and MNGIE. Variants in the MT-­ATP6 gene have also been
linked to this condition.

MITOCHONDRIAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHIES

Several recessive mitochondrial disorders cause cavitating leukoencephalopathies (Table 638.8) that typically present in infancy or early
childhood with acute-­or subacute-­onset of motor regression. Other
clinical features include epileptic encephalopathy, hemiparesis, spastic
paraparesis, bulbar problems, and visual loss (optic atrophy). Mitochondrial leukoencephalopathies may also present later in childhood
or in adult life. Some of the mitochondrial tRNA aminoacyl synthetase deficiencies appear to cause specific white matter changes. Other
genetic causes of mitochondrial leukoencephalopathy include variants
in subunits of complexes I and II and defects of iron-­sulfur cluster biosynthesis (see Table 638.8).

LEBER HEREDITARY OPTIC NEUROPATHY AND
AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT OPTIC ATROPHY

Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) and autosomal dominant
optic atrophy (ADOA) are two mitochondrial optic neuropathies that
may occasionally present with additional encephalomyopathic features.
LHON is maternally inherited and typically presents in the second or
third decade of life (mean onset ∼20 years, but childhood presentation is well-­recognized) with subacute or acute visual loss sequentially
affecting both eyes. Three common mtDNA variants in genes encoding
complex I subunits (m.3460G>A in MT-­ND1, m.11778G>A in MT-­
ND4, and m.14484T>C in MT-­ND6) account for 90% of cases. Penetrance is incomplete, and there is an extreme male preponderance,
which may be explained by a protective effect of estrogen in females
with LHON variants. In most cases LHON presents as an isolated
optic neuropathy, but other clinical manifestations in occasional cases
include dystonia (with bilateral striatal necrosis), peripheral neuropathy, or cardiac conduction defects.
ADOA, also known as Kjer disease, is the most frequent genetic optic
neuropathy and is caused by dominant variants of OPA1, encoding a
protein needed for mitochondrial fusion. Usually this is an isolated
optic neuropathy but may be associated with SNHL. In some patients
there are biallelic variants of OPA1 leading to multiple mtDNA deletions and additional manifestations, including PEO, RRF myopathy
and white matter lesions, and cerebellar atrophy associated with ataxia,
pyramidal signs, spasticity, and learning disability.

NONSYNDROMIC MITOCHONDRIAL DISORDERS

In childhood, many patients affected by mitochondrial disease present with complex multisystem features that do not align closely with
any of the specific known mitochondrial syndromes or with nonsyndromic features, such as isolated epilepsy, leukoencephalopathy, or
myopathy. These patients may lack biochemical features of mitochondrial disease such as lactic acidosis and are identified by exome and
genome sequencing as a first-­line diagnostic strategy in children with
encephalomyopathies.

APPROACH TO DIAGNOSIS

When a mitochondrial disease is suspected, it is important to take
a thorough personal and family history, including enquiring about
early deaths within the extended family, and to screen for multisystemic involvement. This may include formal ophthalmologic, audiologic, and cardiac evaluation. There is no single diagnostic test that
can detect all mitochondrial diseases. There are some characteristic
MRI appearances, such as bilateral symmetric involvement of the
basal ganglia and/or brainstem in Leigh syndrome, strokelike lesions

in MELAS, and the specific leukoencephalopathies outlined in Tables
638.6 and 638.8. However, brain MRI rarely leads to a specific genetic
diagnosis other than in these distinctive leukoencephalopathies. Metabolic investigations that may provide diagnostic clues include blood
lactate, plasma amino acids and acylcarnitines, urine organic acids,
and CSF lactate, amino acids, neurotransmitters, and 5-­MTHF. The
traditional approach to diagnose a mitochondrial disease included
a muscle biopsy, which was subject to histologic, histochemical,
and electron microscopic analysis, as well as spectrophotometric or
polarographic assay of the individual OXPHOS enzyme complexes.
However, in most centers muscle biopsy has been replaced by first-­
line genetic approaches that utilize next-­generation sequencing to
sequence the mtDNA, a large panel of nuclear genes, the exome or the
whole genome. Muscle biopsy still retains a place in the investigation
of critically unwell children with suspected mitochondrial disease and
to provide functional validation of variants of unknown significance
identified by genetic testing.

MANAGEMENT

cardiac pacing (which can be lifesaving in heart block caused by KSS),
and medical management of heart failure.
Emerging therapies under investigation for mitochondrial encephalomyopathies can be divided broadly into pharmacologic and genetic
approaches. Pharmacologic therapies under development include
redox modulation and strategies to replenish reduced nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD) boost mitochondrial biogenesis, and
stabilize cardiolipin, the membrane lipid unique to mitochondria. A
successful trial of adeno-­associated virus (AAV) gene replacement has
been published for LHON caused by MT-­ND4 variants, and gene therapy has been reported for mouse models of several nuclear-­encoded
mitochondrial diseases but has yet to be translated to the clinic.

638.3 Other Encephalopathies
Michael Perry and Cheryl Hemingway

There are no curative therapies for most mitochondrial encephalomyopathies, but there are a few notable exceptions. Leigh syndrome
caused by deficiency of the SLC19A3 thiamine transporter may
respond to a combination of biotin and thiamine, and some patients
with disorders of CoQ10 biosynthesis may improve with high-­dose
CoQ10 supplementation. High-­dose CoQ10 supplementation appears
to be particularly effective in preventing (but not reversing) the
renal manifestations of CoQ10 deficiency but has proved ineffective in treating the CNS manifestations of this disorder in prenatal/
neonatal-­onset CoQ10 biosynthesis disorders associated with COQ4
and COQ9 variants.
Symptomatic therapies are the mainstay of management for children
with mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. Supportive measures may
include antiepileptic drugs, hearing aids, cochlear implantation, ptosis surgery, enteral feeding, pancreatic enzyme supplements, hormone
replacement (thyroxine, cortisol, growth hormone, insulin, estrogen),

POSTERIOR REVERSIBLE ENCEPHALOPATHY
SYNDROME

Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a rare clinical
syndrome of acute neurologic dysfunction in the presence of vasogenic
subcortical brain edema.
The pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying PRES are poorly
understood. Endothelial injury, however, with subsequent blood-­brain
barrier breakdown and vasogenic edema, appears to be a critical factor. Sudden increases in blood pressure exceeding capacity for cerebral
blood flow autoregulation, direct cytokine effects, and cytotoxic drugs
are all plausible mediators of the endothelial dysfunction. The posterior circulation may be more vulnerable to increased blood pressure
because of a relative lack of sympathetic innervation. Children taking
immunosuppressant or cytotoxic drugs (e.g., calcineurin inhibitors,

Subsequently obtained T2-­weighted (B) and FLAIR (C) MRIs showed a symmetric abnormally high signal in the posterior cerebral white matter. (From

cyclosporine, tacrolimus) in the context of organ transplantation, cancer, and autoimmune disease are at highest risk of developing PRES;
renal disease (e.g., glomerulonephritis, IgA vasculitis) is also a risk
factor.
Neurologic symptoms in PRES (i.e., seizures, encephalopathy, headache, and visual disturbances) develop over hours to days. Seizures
occur almost universally; a focal onset with subsequent generalization
is common, and status epilepticus may occur. Encephalopathy can
range from mild alteration of mental state to coma. Focal deficits (e.g.,
hemiparesis) are seen in a small minority of patients.
MRI characteristically shows asymmetric T2/FLAIR high-­
signal
intensities corresponding to vasogenic edema predominantly in the
parieto-­occipital regions (Fig. 638.9). The basal ganglia, cerebellar
hemispheres, and brainstem may also be involved. The changes are
almost always seen bilaterally and invariably involve the subcortical
white matter with or without hemorrhage (intraparenchymal, petechial, or subarachnoid), restricted diffusion, or contrast enhancement
(leptomeningeal, cortical, or nodular). Radiologic resolution typically
occurs in days to weeks.
There are no PRES-­specific treatments. Care is therefore supportive
and should be directed at restoration of a normotensive state, control of
seizures with appropriate anticonvulsants, and discontinuation of any
offending agent (e.g., cytotoxic drugs). Continuous infusions of antihypertensives may be useful to prevent dramatic fluctuations of blood pressure.
Contrary to what its name suggests, PRES is not always reversible
(nor does it always occur posteriorly). Despite this, the prognosis is
generally favorable with complete recovery seen in up to 85% of children. Clinical and radiologic improvement becomes evident days to
weeks after symptom onset. Hemorrhage is most often responsible for
permanent disability.

ACUTE NECROTIZING ENCEPHALOPATHY

Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) is a rare severe encephalopathy characterized by a rapid and fulminant course. It is seen most
often in children under 2 years old in East Asian countries, particularly Japan and Taiwan. Most cases are monophasic and sporadic.
However, a familial and recurrent form has been reported in White
children in North America and Europe. Approximately half of these
cases are associated with pathogenic variants in the mitochondria-­
related RAN-­binding protein 2 (RANBP2) gene; this variant is termed
ANE1. The pathogenesis is not well understood but may be driven by
hyper-­cytokinemia (e.g., interleukin [IL]-­6) triggered by a preceding

ANE presents with a dramatic encephalopathy after a febrile, “viral”
prodrome. Neurologic deficits are profound with rapid progression
to coma. Seizures are normally present, and progression of systemic
inflammatory dysregulation such as shock, organ failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation is common. Elevated hepatic enzymes
without hyperammonemia are a unique feature. MRI is characterized
by bilateral symmetric thalamic lesions with or without lesions in the
tegmentum, cerebellar medulla, internal capsule, or periventricular
white matter (Fig. 638.10). Table 638.9 lists the diagnostic criteria.

some benefit. Treatment is otherwise supportive, usually in an intensive care setting. Prognosis in ANE is poor, particularly in children
with brainstem involvement. Mortality rates approach 40%, and severe
neurologic sequelae are typical in surviving children.

638.4 Autoimmune Encephalitis
Thaís Armangué and Josep Dalmau
Autoimmune encephalitis comprises an expanding group of clinical
syndromes that can occur at all ages (<1 year to adult) but preferentially affect children and younger adults. Some of these disorders
are associated with antibodies against neuronal cell surface proteins
and synaptic receptors involved in synaptic transmission, plasticity, or neuronal excitability. The syndromes vary according to the

associated antibody, with phenotypes that resemble those in which
the function of the target antigen is pharmacologically or genetically modified.
Most of these disorders are severe and potentially fatal, but patients
frequently respond to immunotherapy with good outcomes. Moreover,
because of the broad spectrum of symptoms—including alterations of
behavior, psychosis, catatonia, insomnia, memory deficits, seizures,
abnormal movements, and autonomic dysregulation—patients usually
require a multidisciplinary treatment approach.
The identification of autoimmune mechanisms has provided a definitive diagnosis to many cases of encephalitis previously considered idiopathic, infectious, or postinfectious even though no causative agents
were found. More than half of cases previously defined as encephalitis lethargica or choreoathetosis post–herpes simplex encephalitis are
currently known to be anti–N-­methyl-­d-­aspartate receptor (NMDAR)
encephalitis.
The mechanisms that trigger the production of the antibodies are
unknown. In a small subgroup of adolescent or young adult patients,
the presence of a tumor that expresses the target neuronal antigen
likely contributes to the triggering of the immune response. In addition, the high prevalence of prodromal viral-­like symptoms has suggested that nonspecific viral infections may contribute to altering the

Chapter 638 u Encephalopathies
immune tolerance for neuronal proteins and increasing the permeability of the blood-­brain barrier to antibodies. Nonetheless, in many
of these diseases the blood-­brain barrier appears intact, and there is
evidence that the autoantibodies are synthesized within the CNS by
plasma cells that form part of the local brain and meningeal inflammatory infiltrates.

GENERAL DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH TO
AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALITIS

Most autoimmune encephalitides have a rapid presentation of multiple
symptoms, usually in less than 3 months, including neurologic and/or
psychiatric alterations frequently associated with seizures or abnormal
EEG, and CSF or MRI evidence of inflammatory changes.
Depending on the combination of clinical features and presence of
neuronal-­specific antibodies, three diagnostic categories have been
established: possible autoimmune encephalitis, probable antibody-­
negative autoimmune encephalitis, and definite antibody-­
positive
autoimmune encephalitis (Table 638.10).
In the pediatric population, the number of autoimmune encephalitis cases associated with well-­defined antibodies is substantially lower
than that affecting the adult population (Table 638.11).

ANTI-­N-­METHYL-­D-­ASPARTATE RECEPTOR
ENCEPHALITIS

In this disease, the immunoglobulin G antibodies target the GluN1
subunit of the NMDA receptor. The estimated annual incidence of this
disorder is 1.2-­1.5 cases per million persons, and it is considered the
second most common cause of autoimmune encephalitis after acute
disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in children and adolescents. Overall, the disease predominates in females (80%); in patients
younger than 12 years, the frequency of males is >40%. The resulting
syndrome is highly predictable and usually evolves in stages. In teenagers and young adults, the disorder usually presents with prominent
psychiatric manifestations that may include rapidly progressive anxiety,
agitation, delusional thoughts, bizarre behavior, labile affect, mood
disturbances (mania), catatonic features, memory deficit, language
disintegration, aggression, and insomnia or other sleep disturbances.
In many cases, these symptoms had been preceded by a few days of
prodromal headache, fever, or viral infection–like symptoms. Patients
are often misdiagnosed with new-­onset psychosis or a primary psychiatric disorder. However, in a few days or weeks, additional symptoms
occur, including a decreased level of consciousness, seizures (including status epilepticus), limb or oral dyskinesias, choreoathetoid movements, and autonomic instability that usually includes tachycardia,
bradycardia, fluctuation of blood pressure, hypoventilation, hyperthermia, and sialorrhea. In rare instances, bradycardia and cardiac pauses
occur, at times requiring the transient use of a pacemaker. The disorder
also occurs in toddlers and infants (the youngest patient identified to
date was 2 months old), and although the evolution of the syndrome
is similar to that of adults, young patients more frequently present
with seizures and movement disorders. Because of the age of patients,
the psychiatric-­
behavioral features may be missed. In this young
age-­group, behavior changes include irritability, new-­onset temper
tantrums, agitation, aggression, reduced speech, mutism, and autistic-­
like regression. Moreover, compared with adults, some children also
develop cerebellar ataxia and hemiparesis; in contrast, autonomic dysfunction is usually milder and less severe in children.
Brain MRI studies are abnormal in approximately 35% of patients,
usually showing nonspecific cortical and subcortical T2–fluid-­
attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal abnormalities, sometimes
with transient cortical or meningeal enhancement; nonspecific white
matter abnormalities can occur. However, if white matter changes are
predominant, an overlapping syndrome with a demyelinating disease
should be suspected (Fig. 638.11A). The CSF is initially abnormal in
approximately 80% of patients, showing moderate lymphocytic pleocytosis and, less frequently, increased protein synthesis and oligoclonal
bands. The EEG is abnormal in virtually all patients; it usually shows
focal or diffuse slow activity in the delta and theta ranges, which does
not correlate with abnormal movements. In addition, many patients

3703

develop epileptic activity, requiring video monitoring for adequate
clinical management. A distinctive EEG pattern called extreme delta
brush, characterized by beta-­delta complexes, occurs in 30% of adults
and less frequently in children (Fig. 638.12).
The diagnosis of the disorder is established by demonstrating
NMDAR antibodies in CSF. The sensitivity is higher in CSF compared
with serum (100% vs 85%), and the levels of antibodies in CSF appear
to correlate better with the outcome. Antibodies may remain detectable, albeit at lower titers, after patients recover.
The presence of an underlying tumor, usually a teratoma, is age and
sex dependent. Whereas 40% of females older than 12 years have an
underlying teratoma of the ovary, the presence of a tumor is unusual
in young males and females or young adult male patients. In children,
an MRI of the abdomen and pelvis and abdominal and testicular ultrasound are the preferred tumor screening tests.
In a small number of patients, anti-­NMDAR encephalitis occurs
simultaneously with or after infections with a variety of pathogens,
including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, herpes simplex virus (HSV),
human herpesvirus 6, enterovirus, COVID-­19, and influenza virus.
With the exception of HSV1, a pathogenic link with most of these
infections has not been established. There is evidence that about
50% of patients with HSV encephalitis develop antibodies against
the GluN1 subunit of the NMDAR and other neuronal cell surface
proteins and receptors, and of these about half the patients develop
new or relapsing neurologic symptoms 2-­12 weeks after completing
treatment for HSV encephalitis. In children younger than 4 years,
this type of autoimmune encephalitis usually manifests with choreoathetosis and dyskinesias (known as choreoathetosis post-­HSV
encephalitis; see Videos 638.1, 638.2, and 638.3). In contrast, older
children and adults more often develop predominantly behavioral
symptoms. A similar complication has been reported in patients
with Japanese encephalitis, who develop autoimmune encephalitis
(usually with NMDAR antibodies) after the viral encephalitis has
subsided.
There is evidence that tumor removal, when appropriate, and
prompt immunotherapy improve the outcome. Most children receive
first-­
line immunotherapies, including corticosteroids, IVIG, or
plasma exchange. However, because these treatments fail in ∼50% of
patients, and with multiple reports showing that rituximab is effective, this treatment is increasingly being used in combination with
IVIG and steroids or after first-­line immunotherapies fail. Cyclophosphamide can be effective when there has been no response to these
treatments.
Approximately 80% of patients recover substantially or fully; mortality is estimated to be ∼5%, usually as a result of infections or autonomic dysregulation during the acute phase of the disease. Recovery is
usually slow and can take as long as 2 years after symptom onset. The
last symptoms to improve are problems in social interactions and language and executive functions. Relapses occur in approximately 15%
of patients; they can develop as partial syndromes, are usually milder
than the initial episode, and respond equally well to immunotherapy.
Initial comprehensive immunotherapy and rituximab appear to prevent or reduce the number of relapses. The efficacy of chronic immunosuppression with drugs such as azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil
in preventing relapses is unknown. Young children with autoimmune
encephalitis, post-­HSV encephalitis, and NMDAR antibodies have a
poorer prognosis than patients with classical anti-­NMDAR encephalitis (see Fig. 638.11B).
The differential diagnosis of anti-­NMDAR encephalitis is extensive and varies according to the stage of the disease (Table 638.12).
The most frequently considered disorders are viral encephalitis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, acute psychosis, and drug
misuse.

tern called extreme delta brush in a 14-­yr-­old female
with anti–N-­methyl-­d-­

nearly continuous combination of delta activity with
superimposed fast activity, usually in the beta range,
symmetrically involving all regions, with a frontal preference in patients who are not under sedation or anesthesia. (From Armangue T, Titulaer MJ, Málaga I, et al.

children (40% of patients are <18 years) and develops with status epilepticus, refractory seizures, or epilepsia partialis continua in association with antibodies against the α1, β3, or γ2 subunits of the GABAAR.
Young children can develop abnormal movements suggestive of anti-­
NMDAR encephalitis but with studies negative for NMDAR antibodies. Unlike other types of autoimmune encephalitis in which the
brain MRI is usually normal or shows nonspecific findings, pediatric
and adult patients with this disorder frequently develop multifocal
hyperintense cortical-­subcortical FLAIR/T2 abnormalities (see Fig.
638.11C). In adults, this encephalitis may occur with thymoma, but
children rarely have an underlying tumor.
Ophelia syndrome is a form of encephalitis that occurs in association with Hodgkin lymphoma and predominantly affects young
adults, teenagers, or children. Some patients develop antibodies
against mGluR5, a receptor involved in learning and memory. Neurologic symptoms are highly responsive to treatment of the tumor and
immunotherapy.
Autoimmune limbic encephalitis refers to an inflammatory
process of the limbic system, including the medial temporal lobes,
amygdala, and cingulate gyri (see Fig. 638.11D). In adults, the most
frequent immune-­mediated limbic encephalitis occurs in association with antibodies against proteins that were once thought to be
voltage-­gated potassium channels (VGKCs) but which, in fact, target
a secreted neuronal protein called leucine-­rich glioma-­inactivated 1
(LGI1) and a protein called Caspr2 expressed in the brain and the
juxtaparanodal regions of myelinated nerves. Adult patients with
LGI1 antibody–associated limbic encephalitis often develop hyponatremia; in some patients, the disorder is preceded by dystonic
or myoclonic-­like movements, described as faciobrachial dystonic
seizures. Adult patients with Caspr2 antibodies can develop limbic
encephalitis, neuromyotonia, or Morvan syndrome, which includes
encephalopathy, seizures, a sleep disorder, autonomic dysfunction,
and neuromyotonia. In children, encephalitis with LGI1 or Caspr2
antibodies is extremely rare. Children with LGI1 antibodies do not
develop hyponatremia or faciobrachial dystonic seizures. Younger
children with Caspr2 antibodies often have similar symptoms to
those of the adults, which can also be accompanied by generalized
weakness, flaccid paresis, hypertensive encephalopathy, hormonal
dysfunction, and palmoplantar erythema or eczema that has been
attributed to sweating and itching. Children with Caspr2 antibodies
do not have associated tumors.
VGKC-­complex antibodies have very limited clinical utility unless
they are specifically characterized as antibodies against LGI1 or Caspr2
proteins. Thus a positive test for VGKC-­complex antibodies without
further information on LGI1 or Caspr2 specificity should be interpreted with caution because it does not necessarily indicate autoimmune encephalitis.
Excluding patients with anti-­
NMDAR– or GABAAR antibody–
associated encephalitis, an exceptionally low number of children with

limbic and other types of neuronal antibody-­associated encephalitis
have been reported in the English literature, some of them with antibodies against neuronal cell surface proteins (GABABR, DPPX, GlyR)
or intracellular proteins (Hu, Ma2, GAD65, amphiphysin). In some
patients, an underlying malignancy was identified, including leukemia,
ganglioneuroblastoma, neuroblastoma, or small cell carcinoma of the
ovary.
Determination of the type of autoantibodies and location of the target
antigens is important because an encephalitis in which the antigens are
on the cell surface (e.g., NMDAR or GABAAR) responds better to immunotherapy than one in which the antigens are intracellular (e.g., GAD65).

ACQUIRED DEMYELINATING SYNDROMES WITH
ENCEPHALOPATHY

ADEM is the most frequent autoimmune encephalitis in children (see
Chapter 640.1). Symptoms may include seizures, motor deficits, ataxia,
and visual dysfunction, among others. The brain MRI typically shows
multifocal demyelinating lesions that can also involve the basal ganglia, brainstem, or cerebellum, with variable contrast enhancement (see
Fig. 638.11F). Antibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
(MOG) occur in 50–60% of patients with ADEM and have a negative
predictive value for evolution to multiple sclerosis in children with a
first demyelinating event (see Chapter 640.1). Some children with MOG
antibodies develop a clinical picture resembling autoimmune encephalitis with MRI FLAIR/T2 increased signal involving cortical regions, with
variable contrast enhancement, or presenting as nondemyelinating focal
or diffuse lesions (see Fig. 638.11E). MOG antibodies may also coexist with NMDAR antibodies; these patients usually develop overlapping
syndromes related to these autoimmunities.
Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) can present
as an encephalopathy with predominant involvement of diencephalic
and area postrema regions. These patients often harbor aquaporin 4
(AQP4) antibodies or MOG antibodies. Determination of these antibodies should be considered in patients with encephalopathy and MRI
findings showing involvement of AQP4-­rich regions, such as the periaqueductal gray matter, hypothalamus, optic nerves, and central region
of the spinal cord (see Chapter 640.2).

HASHIMOTO ENCEPHALOPATHY

Hashimoto encephalopathy, also known as steroid-­responsive
encephalopathy with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT), is a controversial disorder defined by the detection of thyroid peroxidase (TPO)
antibodies in patients with acute or subacute encephalitis that responds
to corticosteroids. Clinical features are not specific and may include
strokelike episodes, tremor, myoclonus, transient aphasia, sleep and
behavior abnormalities, hallucinations, seizures, and ataxia. The CSF,
MRI, and EEG findings are not specific. The diagnosis of this disorder
should be based on the exclusion of other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Pretreatment criteria of Hashimoto encephalopathy do

DISORDER

COMMENTS

Viral encephalitis

Viral encephalitis is often suggested by the acute onset of symptoms, CSF pleocytosis, and
hyperthermia. Most viral encephalitides (except rabies) occur with higher levels of CSF pleocytosis and
protein concentration. Psychosis and dyskinesias are significantly less frequent in viral encephalitis than
in anti-­NMDAR encephalitis.

New neurological symptoms postHSV encephalitis

Occurs ∼2-­12 wk after successful treatment of HSV encephalitis. This may represent a true viral relapse
of encephalitis (CSF PCR-­positive, progression of necrotic MRI changes, response to acyclovir) or
an autoimmune disorder (CSF PCR-­negative, no new necrotic lesions on MRI, lack of response to
acyclovir). In a proportion of the latter patients, the disorder is anti-­NMDAR encephalitis.

New-­onset psychosis

Because most patients with anti-­NMDAR encephalitis present with psychosis, a psychiatric disorder is
frequently considered. When the disease evolves, the development of neurologic symptoms usually
reveals the diagnosis.

Drugs/toxins

The acute development of personality and behavioral changes and symptoms suggesting involvement
of dopaminergic pathways (rigidity, dystonia, orofacial movements) usually leads to a suspicion of drug
use (e.g., ketamine, phencyclidine, synthetic cannabinoids, among others).

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
(NMS)

The occurrence of an altered level of consciousness, episodes of rigidity, hyperthermia, and autonomic
instability often suggest NMS. In addition, some patients with anti-­NMDAR encephalitis have elevated
serum creatine kinase and rhabdomyolysis (in the absence of antipsychotic medication). The frequent
use of neuroleptics to control the abnormal behavior adds further confusion between both syndromes.
The presence of dyskinesias and catatonia suggest anti-­NMDAR encephalitis.

Limbic encephalitis (LE)

Criteria of LE are well defined. Patients with LE do not have dyskinesias or central hypoventilation;
the MRI usually shows abnormalities restricted to the medial temporal lobes, and the EEG findings
(epileptic or slow activity) are largely restricted to the temporal lobes.

Encephalitis lethargica

This is an ill-­defined entity, likely representing multiple disorders. Criteria include acute or subacute
encephalitis with at least three of the following: signs of basal ganglia involvement; oculogyric crises;
ophthalmoplegia; obsessive-­compulsive behavior; akinetic mutism; central respiratory irregularities;
and somnolence and/or sleep inversion. Many patients categorized as encephalitis lethargica
hyperkinetica have anti-­NMDAR encephalitis.

Childhood disintegrative disorder/
late-­onset autism

Children with anti-­NMDAR encephalitis often show cognitive regression, rapid loss of language function,
autistic features, and seizures, suggesting a childhood disintegrative disorder. Although the prognosis
of CDD is poor, most patients with anti-­NMDAR encephalitis respond to immunotherapy and have a
substantial clinical recovery.

Kleine-­Levin syndrome

Symptoms of hypersomnia, compulsive hyperphagia, hypersexuality, apathy, and childlike behavior,
which are typical components of Kleine-­Levin syndrome, may occur transiently during the process of
recovery of anti-­NMDAR encephalitis or as permanent sequelae. However, different from the KleineLevin syndrome, the symptoms in anti-NMDAR encephalitis are not relapsing-­remitting

Inborn errors of metabolism

Glutaric aciduria type I can present in previously asymptomatic patients as episodes of encephalopathy
with dystonia, coinciding with an infection or febrile process. Several inborn errors of metabolism
can also occur with acute or subacute encephalopathy with extrapyramidal signs, including
3-­methylglutaconic aciduria, creatine transport deficiency, mitochondrial disorders (Leigh syndrome),
Wilson syndrome, and Lesch-­Nyhan syndrome. Pantothenate kinase–associated neurodegeneration,
porphyria, and urea cycle defects should also be considered.

Genetic disorders that can manifest
as autoimmune encephalitis

HLH (often initial presentation as primary CNS with later 1-­2 yr onset of systemic features) RANBP2
variants, interferonopathies, autoinflammatory syndromes including cryopyrin-­associated periodic
syndromes, Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, and CTLA4 deficiency can present with clinical features
mimicking ADEM or autoimmune or infectious encephalitis. MRI often shows hyperintense T2/FLAIR
abnormalities involving white matter with contrast enhancement in HLH and CTLA4 deficiency; both
thalami in RANBP2 variants; and may show striatal necrosis with or without associated hypomyelination
in ADAR1 interferonopathy. CSF is abnormal in most patients. Some patients develop systemic
symptoms (e.g., fever, arthralgias or rash in autoinflammatory syndromes, or autoimmune cytopenias or
hypogammaglobulinemia in CTLA4 deficiency) that can help to make the diagnosis, which is confirmed
by genetic testing.

Monoamine neurotransmitter
disorders

Deficiency of dopamine or serotonin, or both, can result in encephalopathy, epilepsy, and pyramidal
and extrapyramidal symptoms. The diagnosis is established by examining the CSF for levels of these
neurotransmitters.

Acquired demyelinating disorders

ADEM and NMOSD are immune-­mediated inflammatory and demyelinating disorders of the central
nervous system. These disorders should be considered in the differential diagnosis of multifocal
neurologic abnormalities and encephalopathy in children. As with anti-­NMDAR encephalitis, these
disorders may be preceded by an infection and can show pleocytosis. The diagnosis is suggested by
the MRI findings. In NMOSD, the presence of AQP4 antibodies in serum or CSF is associated with
relapses and poor prognosis. MOG antibodies occur in ∼50% of children with ADEM and some patients
with NMOSD.

COMMENTS

CNS vasculitis

CNS vasculitis (including RVCLS:TREX1) results in neurologic deficits and psychiatric manifestations.
The diagnosis is established by angiography in large-­vessel angiitis and brain biopsy in small vessel
angiitis. In the latter, serum inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-­reactive protein,
Complement 3, von Willebrand factor antigen) are usually elevated, and the MRI shows FLAIR/T2
abnormalities in the white and/or gray matter suggesting ischemia and microhemorrhages, but are not
restricted to vascular territories and frequent leptomeningeal and/or local enhancement.

Systemic rheumatic disorders

Systemic lupus erythematosus and other rheumatic disorders can result in encephalopathy and multifocal
neurologic and psychiatric manifestations. These disorders are usually suggested by the presence of
signs and symptoms of involvement of systemic organs: skin, joints, kidneys, blood-­forming cells, and
blood vessels.

not predict steroid responsiveness. Because TPO antibodies occur in
approximately 10% of asymptomatic children (i.e., nonencephalopathic
and, in most cases, euthyroid) and can also be found in some patients
who have more relevant antibody-­associated diseases, the detection of
TPO antibodies should be viewed as a marker of autoimmunity rather
than a disease-­specific or pathogenic antibody. Therefore detection of
TPO antibodies should not prevent testing for more relevant antibodies, such as NMDAR antibodies.
Acute cerebellar ataxia and acute cerebellitis are the most frequent causes of cerebellar dysfunction in children. Ataxia and dysmetria are usually the main presenting symptoms, but some patients
present with headache, vomiting, and decreased level of consciousness caused by intracranial hypertension. Brain MRI is normal in
patients with acute cerebellar ataxia, but in cases of cerebellitis it
shows T2/FLAIR hyperintensities in the white and gray matter of
the cerebellum along with edema that may cause obstruction of
the fourth ventricle and hydrocephalus. Treatment with steroids is
usually effective, but some patients may need decompressive craniectomy. Whereas acute cerebellar ataxia with normal MRI is often
self-­limiting and has a benign course, cerebellitis with MRI abnormalities associates with a less favorable prognosis and almost half of
them have residual neurologic deficits. The most frequent cause of
acute cerebellar ataxia and cerebellitis is a viral infection; much less
frequently, they may occur after bacterial infections or vaccines. A
few cases with antibodies against the glutamate kainate 2 (GluK2)
receptor have been reported.

In addition, insomnia and an abnormal response to pain are common. Relapses occur in 50% of patients, usually as a result of an
intercurrent infection or drug tapering. Patients treated with more
aggressive immunosuppression (often including rituximab) have better outcomes compared with historic control series or patients who
did not receive these treatments. Delay in treatment appears to be
associated with a poorer neurologic outcome; therefore in cases with
neuroblastoma, removal of the tumor should not delay the start of
immunotherapy.
In teenagers and young adults, opsoclonus-­
myoclonus and
brainstem-­
cerebellar encephalitis without opsoclonus are often
considered idiopathic or postinfectious; however, there is evidence
that some of these patients have an underlying teratoma, usually
in the ovaries. These patients do not harbor NMDAR antibodies,
and compared with those with anti-­NMDAR encephalitis, they are
less likely to present with psychiatric symptoms or dyskinesias.
Although these patients do not appear to have neuronal antibodies, the CSF often shows pleocytosis and an elevated protein concentration. Treatment with immunotherapy (corticosteroids, IVIG,
and/or plasma exchange) and removal of the ovarian teratoma frequently associate with full recovery. The prognosis of opsoclonus-­
myoclonus in teenagers and young adults seems better than that
of young children (with or without neuroblastoma) or of the paraneoplastic opsoclonus of older patients, usually related to breast,
ovarian, or lung cancer.

OPSOCLONUS-­MYOCLONUS AND OTHER TYPES
OF RARE BRAINSTEM-­CEREBELLAR ENCEPHALITIS

This term is used to describe patients with rapid progression (<4 weeks)
of bilateral external ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and decreased level
of consciousness. Although this entity has been described more frequently in adults, children as young as 3 years old have been identified.
Most patients are treated with steroids, IVIG, or plasma exchange; they
often have a good outcome. Serum GQ1b immunoglobulin G antibodies are found in 66% of patients. Brain MRI abnormalities occur in 30%
of patients and usually include increased T2-­signal abnormalities in the
brainstem, thalamus, and cerebellum and sometimes in the cerebral
white matter. Some patients develop hyporeflexia and limb weakness,
with predominant axonal involvement, overlapping with symptoms
of Miller-­Fisher syndrome and the axonal subtype of Guillain-­Barré
syndrome.

Opsoclonus-­myoclonus occurs in infants, teenagers, and adults,
although it probably represents different diseases and pathogenic
mechanisms. In infants, the syndrome usually develops in the first
2 years of life (mean: 20 months), and at least 50% of patients have
an underlying neuroblastoma. The child often presents with irritability, ataxia, falling, myoclonus, tremor, and drooling. Additional
symptoms may include a refusal to walk or sit, speech problems,
hypotonia, and the typical features of opsoclonus characterized by
rapid, chaotic, multidirectional eye movements without saccadic
intervals. Because opsoclonus may be absent at symptom presentation, patients may initially be diagnosed with acute cerebellitis.
Typically, CSF abnormalities suggest B-­cell activation, and the presence of antibodies against neuronal proteins has been demonstrated
in rare instances, but the identification of a specific autoantigen has
been elusive.
Immunotherapy, including corticosteroids and IVIG, often
improves the abnormal eye movements, but residual behavioral,
language, and cognitive problems persist in the majority of patients.

brainstem, cerebellum, and, occasionally, spinal cord dysfunction.
A brain MRI shows symmetric curvilinear gadolinium enhancement peppering the pons and extending variably into the medulla,
brachium pontis, cerebellum, and midbrain and occasionally into
the spinal cord. The clinical and radiologic findings usually respond
to high-­dose steroids but may worsen after steroid tapering, requiring chronic steroid or other immunosuppressive therapy. The differential diagnosis is extensive and includes infections, acquired
demyelinating syndromes, granulomatous disease, lymphoma, or
vasculitis. Biopsy studies may be needed to exclude these and other
conditions.

AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOPATHIES ASSOCIATED
WITH EPILEPSY AND STATUS EPILEPTICUS

Rasmussen encephalitis is an inflammatory encephalopathy characterized by progressive refractory focal seizures, cognitive deterioration, and focal neurologic deficits that occur with gradual
atrophy of one brain hemisphere. The disorder frequently presents
in children 6-­8 years old, although adolescents and adults can be
affected. The etiology is unknown, and therefore multiple theories
are proposed, including the presence of neuronal antibodies and
T-­cell–mediated mechanisms triggered by a viral infection. None
of these mechanisms satisfactorily explain the unilateral brain
involvement characteristic of the disorder. Treatment with high-­
dose steroids, plasma exchange, or IVIG can ameliorate symptoms
in early stages of the disease. Multiple different approaches with
immunotherapy, including rituximab, tacrolimus, azathioprine,
adalimumab, mycophenolate mofetil, natalizumab, or anakinra
have not substantially changed the poor outcome of most patients.
The most effective treatment for control of the seizures is functional hemispherectomy, which consists of surgical disconnection
of the affected hemisphere.

OTHER SUSPECTED TYPES OF AUTOIMMUNE
ENCEPHALITIS

Vasculitis of the CNS and rheumatic diseases associated with autoimmune mechanisms that can result in encephalitis are discussed in
Chapter 642.
Rapid-­onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) is discussed in Chapter
468.3.
The term basal ganglia encephalitis is used to describe patients
with predominant or isolated involvement of the basal ganglia.
These patients typically have abnormal movements such as dystonia,
chorea, or parkinsonism and neuropsychiatric disease. Although
these clinical manifestations may have multiple etiologies, including metabolic, toxic, genetic, and infectious processes, an immune-­
mediated etiology has been postulated in some patients. There have
been no clinical trials, but case reports and small noncontrolled case
series describe the potential benefit of immunotherapy. Antibodies
against the dopamine-­2 receptor have been infrequently identified
in these patients.
Pseudomigraine syndrome with CSF pleocytosis (PMP) or headache with neurologic deficits and CSF lymphocytosis (HaNDL) is
an ill-­defined entity that predominantly affects young male adults
with a family history of migraine, although adolescents can be
affected. This syndrome is characterized by repeat episodes of severe
headache with transient neurologic deficits, accompanied by aseptic CSF lymphocytosis and a normal brain MRI. Patients frequently
show a high CSF opening pressure, an elevated CSF protein concentration, and focal EEG slowing, which normalize after the episodes
of headache. Because of the inflammatory characteristics of the CSF
and the high prevalence of prodromal viral-­like symptoms, an infectious–immune-­mediated mechanism has been proposed. Other theories include spreading cortical depression and trigeminal-­vascular
activation.

Neurodegenerative
Disorders of Childhood
Kristin A. Seaborg and Jennifer M. Kwon
Neurodegenerative disorders of childhood encompass a large, heterogeneous group of diseases caused by specific genetic and biochemical
defects. Although many children with neurodegenerative disorders first
present with developmental delay or seizures, the hallmark of a neurodegenerative disease is regression and progressive deterioration of
neurologic function with loss of speech, vision, hearing, locomotion,
feeding difficulties, and cognitive decline. The age of onset, rate of progression, and principal neurologic findings determine whether the disease affects primarily the white or the gray matter. Upper motor neuron
signs and progressive spasticity are the hallmarks of white matter disorders; convulsions and intellectual and visual impairments that occur
early in the disease course are the hallmarks of gray matter disorders.
A precise history confirms regression or delay of developmental milestones, and the neurologic examination localizes the process within
the nervous system. At that point, modern neuroimaging techniques
and specific biochemical and molecular diagnostic tests are used to
arrive at a diagnosis. Although available therapies are often limited, it
is important to make the correct diagnosis so that genetic counseling
may be offered and prevention strategies can be implemented. Bone
marrow transplantation, enzyme replacement therapies, cell-­
based
gene therapy, immune modulation, and dietary restrictions may prevent the progression of disease in certain individuals who are either
presymptomatic or very early in their disease course. For all conditions
in which the specific genetic defect is known, prevention by prenatal
diagnosis through chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis is possible, as is carrier detection. Table 639.1 summarizes selected inherited
neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders by their usual age of onset.

639.1 Sphingolipidoses
Kristin A. Seaborg and Jennifer M. Kwon
The sphingolipidoses are characterized by intracellular storage of lipid
substrates resulting from defective catabolism of the sphingolipids comprising cellular membranes (Fig. 639.1). Poorly degraded sphingolipids
accumulate in neuronal lysosomes leading to cellular dysfunction and
death. There are multiple sphingolipidoses, including Niemann-­Pick
disease, Gaucher disease, GM1 gangliosidosis, GM2 gangliosidosis,
Krabbe disease (KD), and metachromatic leukodystrophy. Niemann-­
Pick disease and Gaucher disease are discussed in Chapter 106.4.

GANGLIOSIDOSES

See also Chapter 106.4.
Gangliosides are sphingolipids consisting of an oligosaccharide
chain attached to a hydroxyl group of ceramide and sialic acid bound
to galactose. The gangliosides are catabolized by sequential cleavage
of the sugar molecules by specific exoglycosidases. Abnormalities in
catabolism result in an accumulation of the ganglioside within the cell,
resulting in disease. Defects in ganglioside degradation include GM1
gangliosidosis and the GM2 gangliosidoses.

GM1 Gangliosidosis

GM1 gangliosidosis is an autosomal recessive condition caused by
deficiency of acid β-­galactosidase from pathogenic variants in GLB1.
It is further classified by age at presentation: infantile (type I), juvenile (type II), and adult (type III), where the age of onset and severity

spastic quadriplegia, and decerebrate rigidity. A cherry-­red spot in the
macula is visualized in approximately 50% of cases (Fig. 639.2). Treatment is supportive, and children rarely survive beyond age 2-­3 years.
Death is often from aspiration pneumonia.
Type II GM1 gangliosidosis presents later in infancy, before 3
years. Initial symptoms consist of weakness, ataxia, and regression of
language. Thereafter, convulsions, spasticity, decerebrate rigidity, and
blindness are the major findings. Unlike type I, coarse facial features
and hepatosplenomegaly are not usually seen. Lumbar vertebrae may
show minor beaking. Children rarely survive beyond 10 years of age.
Adult GM1 gangliosidosis is a slowly progressive disease with onset
between ages 3 and 30 years consisting of spasticity, ataxia, dysarthria,
cardiomyopathy, and a gradual loss of cognitive function.

GM2 Gangliosidoses

The GM2 gangliosidoses are a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders caused by abnormal catabolism of the GM2 ganglioside,
which accumulates in neuronal lysosomes. GM2 catabolism requires
functional isoenzymes β-­hexosaminidase and GM2 activator protein.
Tay-­Sachs disease (TSD), Sandhoff disease, juvenile GM2 gangliosidosis, and adult GM2 gangliosidosis are caused by genetic variants in the
genes that encode the alpha and beta subunits of β-­hexosaminidase
and lead to decreased or absent β-­hexosaminidase activity with subsequent accumulation of GM2.
TSD is most prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, with an
approximate carrier rate of 1 in 30 Jews in the United States. TSD is
caused by pathogenic variants in HEXA on chromosome 15q23, which

encodes the α subunit of β-­hexosaminidase. Affected infants often have
a marked startle reaction to noise that is evident soon after birth but
otherwise have normal development until ∼6 months of age. They then
begin to lag in developmental milestones and gradually lose the ability to stand, sit, and vocalize by age 1. Children with TSD have earlier
onset of dysphagia than children with other GM2 gangliosidoses. Early
hypotonia develops into progressive spasticity and relentless deterioration follows, with convulsions, blindness, deafness, and cherry-­red
spots in almost all patients (see Fig. 639.2). Macrocephaly becomes
apparent by 1 year of age and results from the 200-­to 300-­fold normal
content of GM2 ganglioside deposited in the brain. Few children live
beyond 3-­4 years of age, and death is usually associated with aspiration
or bronchopneumonia.
To diagnose TSD or any of the GM2 gangliosidoses, a deficiency of
the isoenzyme β-­hexosaminidase is found in blood, serum, or fibroblasts. In addition, molecular genetic testing may be done to evaluate
for variants in the HEXA or HEXB gene to confirm the diagnosis.
Sandhoff disease occurs secondary to a variant HEXB gene located
on chromosome 5q13. Affected infants present very similar to TSD,
including progressive loss of motor and language milestones beginning
at 6 months of age. Unlike children with TSD, children with Sandhoff
disease may also have visceromegaly. The visual evoked potentials
(VEPs) are normal early in the course of Sandhoff disease and TSD
but become abnormal or absent as the disease progresses. The auditory
brainstem responses show prolonged latencies. The diagnosis of Sandhoff disease is established by finding deficient levels of hexosaminidases
A and B in serum and leukocytes. Children usually die by 3 years of age.
Juvenile GM2 gangliosidosis develops in mid-­childhood, initially
with clumsiness followed by ataxia. Signs of spasticity, athetosis, loss
of language, and seizures gradually develop. Progressive visual loss
is associated with optic atrophy, but cherry-­red spots rarely occur in
juvenile GM2 gangliosidosis. A deficiency of hexosaminidase is variable (total deficiency to near normal) in these patients. Death occurs
around 15 years of age.
Although the genetic etiologies of the gangliosidoses are well-­
established, there is currently no known treatment for these disorders
other than supportive management and palliative care. An adeno-­
associated virus-­
HEXA/HEXB–directed gene therapy proof-­
of-­
concept trial has been performed in two children with TSD.

KRABBE DISEASE (GLOBOID CELL
LEUKODYSTROPHY)

Krabbe disease (KD) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative
disorder characterized by severe myelin loss and the presence of globoid bodies in the white matter. The gene for KD (GALC) is located
on chromosome 14q24.3-­q32.1. The disease results from a marked
deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme galactocerebroside β-­galactosidase

(GALC). KD is a disorder of myelin destruction rather than abnormal
myelin formation. Normally, myelination begins in the third trimester,
corresponding with a rapid increase of GALC activity in the brain. In
patients with KD, galactocerebroside cannot be metabolized during the
normal turnover of myelin because of deficiency of GALC. Nonmetabolized galactocerebroside stimulates the formation of globoid cells,
which can be cytotoxic to oligodendrocytes. Because oligodendroglial
cells are responsible for the elaboration of myelin, their loss results in
myelin breakdown, thus producing additional galactocerebroside and
causing a vicious circle of myelin destruction.
Myelin exists in both the central and peripheral nervous system
and allows for rapid conduction along axons. With GALC deficiency
and associated rapid and severe demyelination, the symptoms of KD
become evident in the first few months of life and include excessive
irritability and crying, poor head control, episodes of hyperpyrexia,
vomiting, and difficulty feeding. In the initial stage of KD, children are
often treated for colic or milk allergy with frequent formula changes.
Generalized seizures may appear early in the course of the disease.
Alterations in body tone with rigidity and opisthotonos as well as visual
inattentiveness caused by optic atrophy become apparent as the disease
progresses. In the later stages of the illness, blindness, deafness, absent
deep tendon reflexes, autonomic instability, and decerebrate rigidity
constitute the major physical findings. Most patients die by 2 years of
age. MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy are useful for evaluating the extent of demyelination in KD. Umbilical cord blood (stem
cell) transplantation from unrelated donors in asymptomatic babies
may favorably alter the natural history but will not help patients who
already have neurologic symptoms. Recombinant GALC triggers an
immune reaction, and the large protein does not efficiently cross the
blood-­brain barrier.
Late-­onset KD has been described beginning in childhood or adolescence. Patients present with pes cavus, sensorimotor demyelinating neuropathy, optic atrophy, and cortical blindness; their condition
may be confused with adrenoleukodystrophy. Slowly progressive gait
disturbances, including spasticity and ataxia, are prominent. Globoid
cells are abundant in the white matter, and leukocytes are deficient in
GALC. MRI may reveal white matter lesions. An examination of the
cerebrospinal fluid shows an elevated protein content, and the nerve
conduction velocities are markedly delayed as a result of segmental
demyelination of the peripheral nerves.

METACHROMATIC LEUKODYSTROPHY

This disorder of myelin metabolism is inherited as an autosomal
recessive trait and is characterized by a deficiency of arylsulfatase
A activity. The ARSA gene is located on chromosome 22q13.33. The
absence or deficiency of arylsulfatase A leads to accumulation of
cerebroside sulfate within the myelin in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, and the excessive cerebroside sulfate is thought
to cause myelin breakdown. Prenatal diagnosis of metachromatic
leukodystrophy (MLD) is made by assaying arylsulfatase A activity
in chorionic villi or cultured amniotic fluid cells. Those affected with
MLD are generally classified according to age of onset: late infantile,
juvenile, and adult.
Late infantile MLD begins with insidious onset of gait disturbances
between 1 and 2 years of age. The child initially appears awkward and
frequently falls, but locomotion is gradually impaired significantly and
support is required to walk. The extremities are hypotonic, and the
deep tendon reflexes are absent or diminished. Within the next several
months, the child can no longer stand, and deterioration in intellectual
function becomes apparent. The speech is slurred and dysarthric, and
the child appears dull and apathetic. Visual fixation is diminished, nystagmus is present, and examination of the retina shows optic atrophy.
Within 1 year from the onset of the disease, the child is unable to sit
unsupported, and progressive decorticate postures develop. Feeding
and swallowing are impaired because of pseudobulbar palsies. Affected
children develop seizures and painful muscle spasms and generalized
irritability. Patients ultimately become stuporous and die of aspiration
or bronchopneumonia by age 5-­6 years. Neurophysiologic evaluation
shows slowing of peripheral nerve conduction velocities caused by

peripheral myelin damage and progressive changes in the VEPs, auditory brainstem responses, and somatosensory evoked potentials. CT
and MRI images of the brain indicate diffuse symmetric attenuation of
the cerebellar and cerebral white matter, and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid shows an elevated protein content.
Late infantile MLD is characterized by little to no functional arylsulfatase A, resulting in rapid accumulation of sulfatides and disease
progression. Bone marrow transplant or lentiviral autologous hematopoietic stem cell gene (ARSA-­cDNA) therapy is a promising experimental therapy for the management of late infantile MLD patients
identified very early in the course of their disease.
Juvenile MLD has many features in common with late infantile
MLD, but the onset of symptoms is delayed to 5-­10 years of age. Deterioration in school performance and alterations in personality may herald the onset of the disease. This is followed by incoordination of gait,
urinary incontinence, and dysarthria. Muscle tone becomes increased,
and ataxia, dystonia, tremor, or diminished deep tendon reflexes may
be present. In the terminal stages, generalized tonic-­clonic convulsions
are prominent and are difficult to control. Patients rarely live beyond
mid-­adolescence. Patients with juvenile MLD usually have one functional copy of ARSA with some residual enzyme activity.

639.2 Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses
Kristin A. Seaborg and Jennifer M. Kwon
The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of inherited,
neurodegenerative, lysosomal storage disorders characterized by
visual loss, progressive dementia, seizures, motor deterioration, and
early death. The NCLs are named because of the intracellular accumulation of fluorescent lipopigments ceroid and lipofuscin. They
comprise a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous group of disorders (currently there are at least 14 NCL types) that have traditionally
been subclassified by age of onset, among other clinical features. With
the exception of CLN4 (Parry disease), which is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait, all other types of NCL are autosomal recessive.
They differ from one another in the associated ultrastructural patterns
of the inclusions as seen by electron microscopy. With the advent of
enzymatic and molecular testing methods, clinicians can make specific
NCL diagnoses using genetic and biochemical testing (Table 639.2).

ceroid lipofuscinoses and its subtypes. Pediatr Neurol. 2014;50:85–95, Fig. 1, p. 88.)

Infantile-­type neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (ICLN, Santavuori
disease) begins in the first year of life with developmental delay, myoclonic seizures, intellectual deterioration, and blindness. Optic atrophy
and brownish discoloration of the macula are evident on examination
of the retina, and cerebellar ataxia is prominent. The infantile form is
caused by recessive pathogenic variants of the gene for the lysosomal
enzyme palmitoyl-­protein thioesterase-­1 (PPT1) on chromosome 1p32.
A number of cell types in INCL patients show characteristic intracellular
fine granular osmiophilic deposits discernible by electron microscopy.
Although death typically occurs during early childhood, a subset of children with PPT1 enzyme deficiency has a much less severe
course with clinical features resembling those of the juvenile-­onset
NCL patients. Clinically, these variant INCL patients have a course that
is often quite distinct from the typical, classic, rapidly degenerating
infantile form, yet they have PPT1 deficiency and granular osmiophilic
deposits on pathology. There is no clear CLN1 genotype that predicts
severity of phenotype.
Late infantile-­type neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL, Jansky-­
Bielschowsky) is the second most common type of NCL and generally
presents with myoclonic seizures beginning between 2 and 4 years of age
in a previously normal child. Dementia and ataxia are combined with a
progressive loss of visual acuity and microcephaly. Examination of the
retina shows marked attenuation of vessels, optic atrophy, and a subtle
brown pigment in the macular region, with associated visual changes
early in the course of disease (Fig. 639.3). The autofluorescent material is
deposited in neurons, fibroblasts, and secretory cells.
LINCL can be caused by autosomal recessive variants of several
different genes: CLN2 gene, which codes for a tripeptidyl peptidase­1 (TPP1) that is essential for the degradation of cholecystokinin-­8,
as well as the CLN5, CLN6, CLN8, and CLN14 genes, which code for
membrane proteins that have not been completely characterized. CLN8
is also known as locus of northern epilepsy syndrome, which is often
called progressive epilepsy with cognitive impairment.
At this time, there is only one clinically approved treatment for all
types of NCL. CLN2 can be treated with intraventricular cerliponase
alfa, a recombinant human proenzyme of TPP1. Treatment with cerliponase alfa can attenuate motor and language decline but does not alter
visual symptoms. Stem cell therapy, gene therapy, and immunomodulatory therapy to repair genetic variants or alter adaptive immunoresponses are all in preclinical studies for adjunctive treatment of NCL.
Juvenile-­type neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL, Spielmeyer-­
Vogt or Batten disease) is the most common form of NCL disease and
is generally caused by autosomal recessive variants in CLN3. Children
affected with JNCL tend to develop normally for the first 5 years of life.
Their initial symptom is usually progressive visual loss, and their retinal pigmentary changes often result in an initial diagnosis of retinitis
pigmentosa. The funduscopic changes are similar to those for LINCL.
After disease onset, there may be a rapid decline with changes in cognition and personality, motor incoordination, and seizures. Myoclonic
seizures are not as prominent as in LINCL, but parkinsonism can

develop and impair ambulation. Patients die in their late 20s to early
30s. In JNCL caused by CLN3, the electron microscopy of tissues shows
deposits called fingerprint profiles, and routine light microscopy of a
peripheral blood smear may show lymphocyte vacuoles.
A possible mimic of JNCL is Lafora disease (LD) caused by pathogenic variants in EPM2A and EPM2B. LD also has skin (eccrine) inclusion bodies in addition to seizures, myoclonus, ataxia, dysarthria,
progressive loss of milestones, and death within 10 years of onset. The
diseases can be distinguished by specific gene sequencing.

639.3 Adrenoleukodystrophy
See Chapter 106.2.

639.4 Sialidosis
Kristin A. Seaborg and Jennifer M. Kwon
Sialidosis is the result of lysosomal sialidase deficiency secondary to an autosomal recessive pathogenic variant in the sialidase
(α-­neuraminidase, NEU1) gene on chromosome 6p21.3. Up to 40
pathologic variants of NEU1 have been identified. The accumulation of
sialic acid–oligosaccharides with markedly increased urinary excretion
of sialic acid–containing oligosaccharides is associated with clinical
presentations that range from the milder sialidosis type I to the more
severe sialidosis type II.
Sialidosis type I, cherry-­red spot myoclonus syndrome, usually
presents in the second decade of life, when a patient complains of visual
deterioration. Inspection of the retina shows a cherry-­red spot, but,
unlike patients with TSD, visual acuity declines slowly in individuals
with cherry-­red spot myoclonus syndrome. Myoclonus of the extremities is gradually progressive and eventually renders patients nonambulatory. The myoclonus is triggered by voluntary movement, touch, and
sound and is not controlled with anticonvulsants. Generalized convulsions responsive to antiseizure medications occur in most patients.
Sialidosis type II patients present at a younger age and have cherry-­
red spots and myoclonus, as well as somatic involvement, including
coarse facial features, hepatosplenomegaly, corneal clouding (rarely),
and dysostosis multiplex, producing anterior beaking of the lumbar vertebrae. Type II patients may be further subclassified into congenital and
infantile (childhood) and juvenile forms, depending on the age of onset
and severity. Examination of lymphocytes shows vacuoles in the cytoplasm, biopsy of the liver demonstrates cytoplasmic vacuoles in Kupffer
cells, and membrane-­bound vacuoles are found in Schwann cell cytoplasm, all attesting to the multiorgan nature of sialidosis type II. Identification of genetic variants in the NEU1 gene can confirm the diagnosis.

Some cases of what appears to be sialidosis type II are the result of combined deficiencies of β-­galactosidase and α-­neuraminidase resulting from
deficiency of protective protein/cathepsin A that prevents premature intracellular degradation of these two enzymes. These patients have galactosialidosis, and they are clinically indistinguishable from those with sialidosis
type II. Consequently, patients who have features of sialidosis type II with
marked urinary excretion of oligosaccharides should be tested for protective protein/cathepsin A deficiency as well as sialidase deficiency.

639.5 Miscellaneous Neurodegenerative
Disorders
Kristin A. Seaborg and Jennifer M. Kwon

PELIZAEUS-­MERZBACHER DISEASE

Pelizaeus-­Merzbacher disease (PMD) is an X-­linked recessive disorder characterized by nystagmus and abnormalities of myelin. PMD is
caused by gene variants in the PLP1 gene on chromosome Xq22, which is
essential for CNS myelin formation and oligodendrocyte differentiation.
Different variants in the same gene can cause a spectrum of disorders,
ranging from the milder familial spastic paraparesis (progressive spastic paraparesis type 2, SPG2) to the more severe connatal form associated
with rapid neurologic decline from an early age and death in the first
decade of life. PLP1 variants causing disease include point changes, deletions, gene duplications, and other gene dosage variants.
Classic PMD is the most common type, clinically recognized by nystagmus and roving eye movements along with head nodding during
infancy. Developmental milestones are delayed; ataxia, choreoathetosis, and spasticity ultimately develop. Optic atrophy and dysarthria are
associated findings, and death occurs in the second or third decade.
The major pathologic finding is a loss of myelin with intact axons, suggesting a defect in the function of oligodendroglia. An MRI scan shows
a symmetric pattern of delayed myelination. The final diagnosis can be
made through genetic testing for variants in the PLP1 gene.
Other PMD-­
like, hypomyelinating leukodystrophies continue to
be identified and should be considered in the differential diagnosis
of PMD. These include Allan-­Herndon-­Dudley syndrome, TUBB4A-­
related disorders, and hypomyelinating leukodystrophy 7 or 8.

ALEXANDER DISEASE

This is a rare disorder that causes progressive macrocephaly and leukodystrophy. Alexander disease is caused by dominant pathogenic variants
in the GFAP gene on chromosome 17q21; cases are usually sporadic.
Pathologic examination of the brain discloses deposition of eosinophilic
hyaline bodies called Rosenthal fibers in astrocyte processes. In the classic
infantile form of Alexander disease (type I), degeneration of white matter is most prominent frontally. The diagnosis may be suggested by MRI
(Fig. 639.4) and MR spectroscopy demonstrating abnormal metabolic
substrates. Affected children develop progressive loss of intellect, spasticity, and treatment-­resistant seizures causing death by 5 years of age.
Patients with type II Alexander disease present later in life and may not
have the characteristic frontal predominance or megalencephaly. Most
patients with type II Alexander disease develop ataxia, and approximately 50% develop difficulty with speech or swallowing.

OTHER LEUKODYSTROPHIES

Metabolic and degenerative disorders can present with significant cerebral white matter changes, such as some mitochondrial disorders (see
Chapters 106.1 and 108) and glutaric aciduria type 1. In addition, the
broader use of brain MRI has brought to light new leukodystrophies.
One example is vanishing white matter disease or childhood ataxia
with central nervous system (CNS) hypomyelination characterized
by ataxia and spasticity (Fig. 639.5). Some patients also have optic

obtained soon after the onset of symptoms. The initial FLAIR image
(A) shows diffuse abnormality and partial cystic degeneration of the
cerebral white matter, whereas the follow-­up FLAIR image (C) shows
that all of the cerebral white matter has been replaced by fluid. The
initial T1-­weighted sagittal image (B) shows the typical stripelike pattern within the abnormal white matter, whereas the follow-­up image
(D) shows that all of the cerebral white matter has disappeared and
that only the cerebral cortex and ependymal lining are preserved. The
cerebellum has become highly atrophic. (A, C from Van der Knaap MS,

atrophy, seizures, and cognitive deterioration. Symptoms worsen rapidly after episodes of fever, head trauma, or external stressors. The age
of presentation and the rapidity of decline in leukodystrophies can be
quite variable. In the early-­onset forms, decline is usually rapid and
followed quickly by death; in the later-­onset forms, mental decline is
usually slower and milder. Interestingly, acute demyelination in these
disorders can be triggered by fever or fright. The diagnosis of vanishing

discriminate between the different types of leukodystrophy and gLE. The first discriminator is the presence or absence of hypomyelination (A).
Within this subset, the presence of improvement of myelination or atrophy directs the clinician toward a series of gLEs. Within the true hypomyelinating leukodystrophies, the presence of basal ganglia and cerebellar involvement further helps refine the diagnosis. If the pattern is not one of
hypomyelination, then the second discriminator is whether the white matter abnormalities are confluent or isolated and multifocal (B). If the white

MENKES DISEASE

Menkes disease (kinky hair disease) is a progressive neurodegenerative
condition inherited as an X-­linked recessive trait. The Menkes gene,
ATP7A, on Xq21.1, codes for a copper-­transporting, P-­type adenosine triphosphatase, and mutations in the protein are associated with
low serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels, as well as a defect in
intestinal copper absorption and transport. The clinical symptoms of
Menkes disease depend on the activity of different enzymes that use
copper as a cofactor, such as superoxide dismutase, cytochrome c oxidase, and dopamine β hydroxylase, among others. Symptoms begin in
the first few months of life and include hypothermia, hypotonia, and
generalized myoclonic seizures. The facies are distinctive, with chubby,
sagging, rosy cheeks and kinky, colorless, friable hair. Microscopic
examination of the hair shows several abnormalities, including trichorrhexis nodosa (fractures along the hair shaft) and pili torti (twisted

hair). Feeding difficulties are prominent and lead to failure to thrive.
Severe cognitive impairment, vascular tortuosity, and optic atrophy are
constant features of the disease. Neuropathologic changes include tortuous degeneration of the gray matter and marked changes in the cerebellum with loss of the internal granule cell layer and necrosis of the
Purkinje cells. Death can occur by 3 years of age in untreated patients.
Very rarely does Menkes disease manifest in females, and when it does,
symptoms are milder.
Copper histidine therapy may be effective in preventing neurologic
deterioration in some patients with Menkes disease, particularly when
treatment is begun in the neonatal period or, preferably, with the fetus.
These presymptomatic children are identified because of a family history of an affected brother and confirmed by target analysis for variants in the ATP7A gene. Infants diagnosed presymptomatically in the
first 10 days of life can be started on an experimental protocol of daily

copper-­histidine subcutaneous injections. Optimal response to treatment appears to occur only in patients who are identified in the newborn
period and whose mutations permit residual copper transport activity.

RETT SYNDROME

This syndrome is characterized as a disorder of early brain development
marked by a period of developmental regression and deceleration of

brain growth after a relatively normal neonatal course. It is an X-­linked
disease that occurs predominantly in females and is one of the most
common causes of cognitive disability in females. The frequency is
approximately 1 in 10,000-­15,000 live births. Rett syndrome is caused by
pathogenic variants in MeCP2 on Xq28, which codes for a transcription
factor that binds to methylated CpG islands and silences transcription.
Clinically, development may proceed normally until 1 year of age,
when regression of language and motor milestones and acquired
microcephaly become apparent. Some atypical forms of Rett syndrome are congenital and can be associated with early-­onset seizures and developmental impairment within the first months of life.
An ataxic gait or fine tremor of hand movements is an early neurologic finding. Most children develop peculiar sighing respirations
with intermittent periods of apnea that may be associated with cyanosis. The hallmark of Rett syndrome is repetitive hand-­wringing
movements and a loss of purposeful and spontaneous use of the
hands; these features may not appear until 2-­3 years of age. Autistic
behavior is a typical finding in all patients. Generalized tonic-­clonic
convulsions occur in the majority but may be well controlled by
anticonvulsants. Feeding disorders and poor weight gain are common. After the initial period of neurologic regression, the disease
process appears to plateau, with persistence of the autistic behavior.
Cardiac arrhythmias may result in sudden, unexpected death at a
rate that is higher than the general population. Females usually survive into adulthood.
Although very few males survive with the classic Rett syndrome
phenotype, genotyping of males without the classic Rett syndrome
phenotype but with intellectual disability and other atypical neurologic
features has detected patients with variants in MeCP2. Gene variants
in MeCP2 have been demonstrated in normal female carriers, females
with Angelman syndrome, and males with fatal encephalopathy, Klinefelter (47,XXY) syndrome, and familial X-­linked cognitive impairment. Males may present with a Rett-­like syndrome if they have an
MECP2 duplication.
Classic Rett syndrome has been treated with trofinetide, an analog
of the amino-­terminal tripeptide of insulin-­like growth factor 1. Its
potential antiinflammatory and trophic properties may be the mechanisms that produce a positive clinical effect. It is approved for patients
≥2 years of age.
Some females have an atypical Rett phenotype associated with severe
myoclonic seizures in infancy, slowing of head growth, and developmental arrest and have variants in another X-­linked gene encoding
for cyclin-­dependent kinase–like 5 (CDKL5), which may interact with
MeCP2 and other proteins regulating gene expression.

NEURODEGENERATION WITH BRAIN IRON
ACCUMULATION

Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation represents multiple age-­of-­onset–dependent disorders characterized by extrapyramidal symptoms and intellectual deterioration and regression, with
iron deposition in the basal ganglia. There is significant phenotypic
variability of these disorders; however, a characteristic finding on
MRI demonstrates symmetric T2-­signal homogeneous hypointensity.
Common neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation disorders
are distinguished in Table 639.4, and an approach to their diagnosis
is noted in Figure 639.8. Clinical features, which are highly variable,
may include dystonia, parkinsonism, ataxia, spasticity, psychiatric
symptoms, and intellectual impairment. Treatment should focus on
the specific disorder and is usually symptomatic relief rather than
curative. Iron chelation has been attempted without major long-­term
benefit.

Demyelinating Disorders
of the Central Nervous
System
Michael Perry and Cheryl Hemingway
Acquired demyelinating syndromes (ADSs) of the central nervous
system (CNS) are rare disorders, occurring with an approximate annual
incidence of 9.8 per million children per year. They present with neurologic dysfunction caused by immune-­mediated injury to the myelin
sheath of the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord. In contrast to genetically determined leukodystrophies (sometimes called dysmyelinating
disorders) that produce disrupted white matter, acquired demyelinating
disorders target normally formed white matter. They can be monophasic or relapsing.
The pathogenesis often involves demyelination together with B
cells and CNS antibodies. Two immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies
recognized as playing an important part in demyelination are aquaporin 4-­antibody (AQP4-­Ab) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody (MOG-­Ab). The aquaporins are plasma membrane
water-­transporting proteins expressed in astrocytes and are primarily involved in water movement, cell migration, and neuroexcitation.
Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is exclusively expressed
in the CNS. Although MOG comprises only a minor component
of the myelin sheath, its location on the outermost lamellae and on
the cell surface of oligodendrocytes makes it available for antibody
binding. Increasing knowledge of the importance of these antibodies in disease, together with available disease-­modifying treatments
(DMTs) has made accurate diagnosis in demyelinating disorders

crucial. Pediatric demyelinating syndromes may be clinically characterized by:
1.	Localization of neurologic deficits: monofocal vs polyfocal
2.	Presence or absence of encephalopathy
3.	Disease course: monophasic vs polyphasic
4.	Presence or absence of specific antibodies
MRI of the brain and spine is essential to characterize both symptomatic and clinically silent demyelinating lesions, aid in the diagnosis
of the specific demyelinating syndrome, predict likelihood of recurrence, and rule out other etiologies. Serial MRIs may be needed to
confirm the diagnosis and can also be used to monitor the treatment
response and guide DMT use. The presence of oligoclonal bands
(OCBs) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is useful to help confirm
the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) (Table 640.1); their absence
may suggest an alternative diagnosis. OCBs, matched or unmatched
(to blood OCB), may also be seen in other CNS inflammatory diseases. Additional laboratory studies, including an autoimmune profile,
antibody testing, metabolic testing, genetic testing, catheter angiography, and less often, brain biopsy, may be required to evaluate for mimics of demyelination. These mimics may include conditions such as
migraine, systemic rheumatologic disorders, mitochondrial disorders,
primary CNS angiitis, infection, neoplasm, and genetic conditions
such as the inherited white matter disorders (e.g., leukodystrophies)
and primary CNS hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)
(Tables 640.2 and 640.3).
Most children presenting with a first episode of demyelination will
experience a monophasic course and do not relapse. Monophasic
demyelinating disorders of childhood may include acute disseminated
encephalomyelitis (ADEM), optic neuritis (ON), and transverse myelitis (TM); relapsing forms of demyelination include MS, MOG, multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis (MDEM), relapsing ON, and
AQP4-­Ab–associated demyelination and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Relapsing disease is often characterized by
gradual accrual of physical disability and cognitive impairment.

DISORDER

DEFINITION

Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)

A first polyfocal CNS event with presumed inflammatory cause
Encephalopathy present that cannot be explained by fever
MRI often showing bilateral diffuse, poorly demarcated T2 lesions
No new symptoms, signs, or MRI findings after initial 3 mo

Multiphasic ADEM

New event of ADEM 3 mo or more after the initial event that can be associated with new or
reemerging clinical and MRI findings
Frequently associated with the presence of MOG-­Ab

Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)

A first monofocal or multifocal CNS demyelinating event
Encephalopathy is absent, unless caused by fever

Multiple sclerosis (MS)

MS can be diagnosed in those for whom there is no better explanation if both
dissemination in time (DIT) and dissemination in space (DIS) can be demonstrated.
DIS
Demonstrated by one or more T2 lesions affecting at least two of the following CNS sites:
• Periventricular
• Juxtacortical or cortical
• Infratentorial
• Spinal cord
DIT
Demonstrated by one of the following:
• Simultaneous presence on MRI of one or more gadolinium-­enhancing lesions AND
one or more nonenhancing lesions
• CSF oligoclonal bands
• Follow-­up MRI (>30 days from previous scan) with one or more new enhanced OR
nonenhanced lesions
• Two or more acute episodes typical of MS each lasting >24 hr and at least 30 days
apart

Primary progressive MS (PPMS)

PPMS is exceedingly rare in childhood, and therefore in cases of suspected PPMS, or
diagnostic uncertainty, specialist advice should be obtained. Biopsy and/or further
genetic investigation may be appropriate to rule out mimics.

MOG-­Ab–associated demyelination

MDEM: recurrent ADEM (see earlier)
ADEM-­ON: ADEM or MDEM followed by optic neuritis (ON)
NMOSD: ON and acute transverse myelitis (ATM), either sequentially or simultaneously
Relapsing inflammatory ON (RION)
Brainstem demyelination: recurrent episodes of demyelination often involving the
posterior fossa and brainstem

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD)

If AQP4–positive, one of the following core criteria is required:
• Optic neuritis
• Acute myelitis
• Area postrema syndrome (nausea, vomiting, hiccups)
• Acute brainstem syndrome
• Narcolepsy, acute diencephalic syndrome with MRI lesions
• Symptomatic cerebral syndrome with MRI lesions
If AQP4-­negative or unavailable, two core criteria and all the following:
1.	At least one core criteria must be optic neuritis, longitudinally extensive TM, or area
postrema syndrome
2.	Dissemination in space (≥2 different core criteria)
3.	Exclusion of alternative diagnoses
If Mog-­Ab–positive with both ON and TM, then MOG + NMOSD may be diagnosed

640.1 Acute Disseminated
Encephalomyelitis
Michael Perry and Cheryl Hemingway
Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is an inflammatory, demyelinating event of early childhood presenting with acute-­onset polyfocal
neurologic deficits, accompanied by encephalopathy and MRI changes
consistent with demyelination (see Table 640.1).

EPIDEMIOLOGY

Although ADEM can occur at any age, most studies report a mean age
between 5 and 8 years with a slight male predominance and an incidence
of 0.1-­0.6 per 100,000 children per year. ADEM is usually monophasic,
but recurrence can occur; this is termed multiphasic disseminated

encephalomyelitis (MDEM) if the recurrence is 3 months or longer
after the incident episode. Approximately 50% of ADEM cases are
associated with serum MOG-­Ab positivity (MOGAD) (see Chapter
640.5). MDEM patients are almost exclusively MOG-­Ab positive. An
episode of ADEM can also be followed by non-­ADEM demyelination
in a new location. If ADEM is followed by a relapse in a specific location, such as the optic nerve, then ADEM-­ON is diagnosed. If the optic
nerve and spinal cord are involved, then NMOSD (see Table 640.1) is
diagnosed. Both ADEM-­ON and NMOSD are associated with MOG­ b positivity.

PATHOGENESIS

Molecular mimicry induced by infectious exposure has long been
thought to trigger the production of CNS autoantigens, though causality has never been proven. Many patients experience a transient febrile

illness in the month before ADEM onset. Preceding infections associated with ADEM include influenza, Epstein-­Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus, varicella, enterovirus, measles, mumps, rubella, herpes
simplex, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and COVID-­19.

X-­linked Charcot-­Marie-­Tooth disease

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Initial symptoms of ADEM may include lethargy, fever, headache,
vomiting, meningeal signs, and seizures, including status epilepticus. Encephalopathy is the hallmark of ADEM. It can range
from behavioral change and persistent irritability to coma. Common neurologic signs include visual loss, ataxia, motor and sensory deficits, and cranial neuropathies. In cases with concurrent
spinal cord involvement, bladder/bowel dysfunction may be seen.
Focal neurologic deficits, however, can be difficult to ascertain in
the obtunded or very young child. The clinical course is usually
rapidly progressive over days, and intensive care may be required,
particularly for patients with brainstem dysfunction or raised
intracranial pressure.

NEUROIMAGING

Brain MRI typically shows large (sometimes confluent), bilateral,
multifocal, edematous, masslike T2 lesions of the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, and brainstem. Deep gray matter structures
(e.g., thalami, basal ganglia) are often involved (Figs. 640.1 and
640.2). Contrast enhancement is variable. The spinal cord may
have an abnormal T2 signal or enhancement, with or without clinical signs of myelitis. ADEM lesions will typically appear to be of
similar age on MRI, but their evolution often lags the clinical presentation. Serial MRI imaging 3-­12 months after ADEM frequently
demonstrates near-­complete resolution of T2 abnormalities, though
residual gliosis may remain.
Severe involvement may progress to an acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalopathy (Weston-­
Hurst disease). This leukodystrophy-­
like
picture is characterized by large lesions, edema with mass affect, and a
polymorphonucleated cell pleocytosis; this contrasts with the CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis typically noted in ADEM.

adrenoleukodystrophy, Alexander
disease, metachromatic LD, Krabbe
disease)

Goutières syndrome)

disease, MELAS, MERFF)

Barr virus, West Nile virus, Japanese B
encephalitis, enterovirus)

(e.g., SLC19A3)
Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE)
and RANBP2 pathogenic variant

There is no biologic marker for ADEM, and laboratory findings can
vary widely. CSF studies are often normal or can exhibit pleocytosis
with lymphocytic or monocytic predominance. CSF protein can be
elevated, especially on repeat studies. Elevated CSF immunoglobulin
production can be present, but true OCB positivity is rare. Electroencephalograms often show generalized slowing, consistent with encephalopathy. Polyregional demyelination of ADEM can also cause focal
slowing or epileptiform discharges.

Increased size of T2 lesions on serial imaging is well recognized in MS,

HIV) should prompt consideration of PML. PML is a risk for MS patients
exposed to more intense immunosuppressive therapies.

Chapter 640 u Demyelinating Disorders of the Central Nervous System
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

ADEM is a clinical diagnosis supported by MRI, CSF, and serum findings.
The differential diagnoses for ADEM are broad; empirical antibiotic and
antiviral treatment should be considered while infectious evaluations are
pending. Follow-­up MRI examinations 3-­12 months after typical ADEM
should show improvement; new or enlarging T2 lesions should prompt
reevaluation for other etiologies such as MS, antibody-­associated disorders, leukodystrophies, tumor, vasculitis, mitochondrial, metabolic, or
rheumatologic disorders (Table 640.4 and see Tables 640.1-­640.3).

TREATMENT

High-­dose intravenous steroids are often prescribed (most commonly
methylprednisolone 20-­30 mg/kg/day for 5 days with a maximum
dose of 1,000 mg/day) followed by an oral prednisolone taper of 1-­2
mg/kg/day (maximum 40-­60 mg/day) over 4-­6 weeks. In refractory
or severe cases, additional treatment options include intravenous

3725

immunoglobulin (2 g/kg administered over 2-­5 days) or plasmapheresis (5-­7 exchanges administered every other day). There is no consensus about the timing of these treatments for ADEM.

PROGNOSIS

Most children experience full motor recovery after ADEM, but residual
deficits can be seen. Cognitive impairment or behavioral changes are
not uncommon. Recovery starts within days to weeks, but symptoms
can fluctuate throughout the course.

640.2 Optic Neuritis
Michael Perry and Cheryl Hemingway
Optic neuritis (ON) is inflammation of one or both optic nerves. It
presents with visual dysfunction. ON can occur in three phenotypes:
(1) as a clinically isolated monophasic syndrome; (2) recurrently in
isolation; or (3) as part of other multifocal systemic or CNS-­specific
inflammatory conditions such as ADEM, MS, or antibody-­associated
demyelination (e.g., AQP-­4-­Ab NMOSD or MOGAD).

EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CLINICAL PRESENTATION

Fig. 640.1 6-­year-­old patient diagnosed with ADEM presenting with
encephalopathy, ataxia, and motor deficits after mild viral infection. Axial T2-­weighted MRI shows bilateral, diffuse, poorly demarcated lesions.
Gray matter involvement, including the thalamus and basal ganglia, is
commonly seen.

ON is one of the most common of the acquired demyelinating syndromes, accounting for ∼25% of all demyelinating presentations in
childhood. The typical presentation is unilateral or bilateral visual loss
over hours to days with abnormal color vision (typically red-­green
desaturation), visual field loss, and sometimes a relative afferent pupillary defect. The visual loss is often severe, with most children at 20/200
visual acuity (VA) or worse. Periocular pain and painful eye movements (often reported as headache in young children) are common.
Bilateral ON is more common in younger children and frequently
associated with MOG-­Ab disease. Unilateral ON is more common in
older children and more likely to be associated with MS. Funduscopic
examination in over half of children reveals acute optic nerve head
swelling (papillitis). However, when the inflammation occurs in the
retrobulbar optic nerve portion, the appearance of the optic nerve may
be normal. Optic nerve pallor is more often noted in the chronic stage
after an initial episode or in those with relapsing ON. Bilateral ON,
longitudinally extensive (>50% of the optic nerve), perineural optic
sheath enhancement (perineuritis), and optic disc edema are features
suggestive of ON caused by MOG-­Ab disease. ON without papillitis
and that involves the optic chiasm or tract is more typical of AQP4-­Ab
(NMOSD) disease.

improvement was seen after steroid therapy. (From Lerner A, Rajamohan A, Shiroishi MS, et al. Cerebral infections and inflammation. In: Haaga JR,

DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION

MRI, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and visual evoked potentials (VEPs) are useful for evaluating and quantifying the functional
and structural integrity of the optic nerve of a child with suspected ON.
Orbital MRI is useful but not required for a diagnosis of ON.
Though sometimes normal, it will usually show optic nerve thickening on T1-­weighted images with T2 hyperintensities and contrast enhancement. (Fig. 640.3F, G). Longitudinally extensive ON

involving the chiasm is thought to be more commonly associated
with antibody-­mediated demyelination (see Fig. 640.3C). Optical
coherence tomography can detect structural neuronal and retinal
change, such as retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning and may
be helpful in monitoring the young child experiencing recurrent
disease. In acute ON, VEPs may detect prolonged latency. VEPs
in children may also detect clinically silent episodes of ON in the
seemingly unaffected contralateral eye.

Chapter 640 u Demyelinating Disorders of the Central Nervous System
CSF OCB analysis is not always indicated; however, in the context
of a normal MRI brain scan, negative OCBs predict a very low risk of
subsequent MS development.
Many conditions can both mimic and be associated with ON.
Therefore although a detailed ophthalmologic review is essential,
other investigations must be carefully considered to exclude systemic
rheumatologic disorders (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE],
sarcoidosis, celiac disease, Behçet disease), infectious diseases (viral
disease, Lyme disease, syphilis, tuberculosis), mitochondrial disorders
(e.g., Leber hereditary optic neuropathy), vascular events, toxic (methanol, ethylene, glycol, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine), nutritional
(folate, vitamin B12, copper deficiencies), or metabolic disorders, and
optic nerve sheath meningioma or optic nerve glioma. Antibody testing in serum with live cell-­based assays (CBAs) for both AQP4-­Ab and
MOG-­Ab is recommended to ensure that prophylactic treatment can
be provided if indicated (e.g., AQP4-­Ab positive) or to provide counseling on the risk of recurrence (MOG-­Ab positivity).

TREATMENT

The standard of care is based on expert clinical opinion and adult trials and typically includes high-­dose intravenous steroids (e.g., methylprednisolone 20-­30 mg/kg/day for 3-­5 days, maximum 1000 mg/day).
In adults, steroid administration leads to faster recovery, but with no
difference in long-­term visual outcome. As with other severe episodes of
demyelination, further treatment options include intravenous immunoglobulin (usually 2 g/kg administered over 2-­5 days) or plasmapheresis
(typically 5-­7 exchanges administered every other day); there is neither
definitive trial evidence of their benefit nor consensus about when to use
them in isolated ON. Trials in adults have concentrated on neuroprotection; phenytoin has a beneficial effect on RNFL thinning in acute ON.
The initiation of chronic immunotherapy is dependent on etiology,
the presence or absence of glial antibodies (e.g., MOG-­Ab), and risk
of relapse (i.e., ON caused by AQP4 +NMOSD) and is best considered
by a multidisciplinary team experienced in the treatment of pediatric
neuroinflammatory disorders.

PROGNOSIS

Although it is reassuring that full recovery of high-­contrast visual acuity (HCVA) does usually occur in children, irreversible damage is often
detected in the structural integrity of affected optic nerves. This may
be evidenced by RNFL thinning on OCT, defective color vision, and
impairments in low-­contrast visual acuity (LCVA). Pediatric patients
with AQP4-­antibody–associated optic nerve demyelination are more
commonly left with long-­term visual disability than patients with other
causes of ON.

640.3 Transverse Myelitis
Michael Perry and Cheryl Hemingway
Transverse myelitis (TM) is a condition characterized by the rapid
development of both motor and sensory deficits of the spinal cord.
It presents acutely as either partial or complete cord involvement at
any level with bilateral neurologic signs; in adults and older children,
there will usually be a clear sensory level. TM has multiple causes
(Tables 640.5 and 640.6). It can be secondary to an immune-­mediated
condition (postinfectious or antibody-­driven), a result of direct infection (e.g., infectious myelitis), or idiopathic. In TM, evidence of spinal cord inflammation can be demonstrated by an enhancing lesion
on MRI, CSF pleocytosis (>10 cells), or an increased IgG index. The
progression is rapid. Time to maximal disability typically occurs 5-­6
days after symptom onset.

EPIDEMIOLOGY

TM is more common in adults but is estimated to affect ∼2 children/
million per year. A bimodal age distribution is observed in those

younger than 5 years and older than 10 years. Children less than 5 years
of age develop spinal cord dysfunction over hours to a few days. They
often have a history of an infectious disease (e.g., viral or mycoplasma)
in the weeks preceding development of neurologic symptoms. The
motor dysfunction is often severe, approaching a complete loss of function. Recovery is slow (weeks to months) and usually incomplete, most
commonly with residual bowel and bladder dysfunction (15–50%).
Pathologic findings of perivascular infiltration with mononuclear cells
suggest an infectious or inflammatory basis. Overt necrosis of the spinal cord may occur.

Table 640.6  Mimics of Transverse Myelitis
ETIOLOGY

DESCRIPTION

Vitamin B12 deficiency

May present as an isolated myelopathy or in combination with neuropathy, encephalopathy, and/or
behavioral changes.
Dorsal column impairment is the most common manifestation, followed by pyramidal dysfunction
(the classic subacute combined degeneration of the cord).
Hematologic manifestations may be absent in up to 30% of patients with neurologic manifestations.
MRI reveals T2-­hyperintense signal in the posterior columns (the “inverted V” or “inverted rabbit
ear” sign on axial views).
In severe cases, MRI shows the “anchor” sign (because of involvement of the posterior, anterior, and
pyramidal tracts).

Vitamin E deficiency

May cause a predominantly dorsal column syndrome associated with a peripheral neuropathy
because of axonal degeneration.
Preferentially affects the cervical cord.
Clinically and radiologically similar to B12 deficiency.

Copper deficiency

May cause both myelopathy and optic neuropathy.
Causes of acquired copper deficiency include malnutrition, zinc toxicity, Menke disease, bariatric
surgery, gastrectomy, malabsorption syndromes, and use of copper chelating agents.
Clinically and radiologically indistinguishable from B12 deficiency.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) toxicity

Analgesic gas commonly abused because of euphoric effects.
N2O inactivates vitamin B12 by irreversible oxidation of the cobalt center of methylcobalamin,
thereby inhibiting the methionine synthesis pathway. In healthy subjects, this does not cause clinical
manifestations. In subclinically B12-­deficient individuals, N2O exhausts residual stocks of vitamin B12,
leading to neurologic manifestations.

Neurolathyrism and neurocassivism

Neurolathyrism is caused by consumption of grass pea.
Neurocassivism (konzo) is caused by bitter cassava root consumption.
Both are found in malnourished populations and are characterized by subacute paraparesis with
prominent UMN features.

Intramedullary primary spinal cord tumors

May be ependymomas, astrocytomas, or hemangioblastomas.
Typically cause an insidious, progressive myelopathy.
Hemorrhage or infarction of the tumor may result in an acute presentation and radiologic
appearance mimicking TM.

Primary CNS lymphoma

May give rise to a clinical and radiologic picture mimicking TM compounded by its corticosteroid
responsiveness.
Congenital or acquired immunodeficiency is the only established risk factor.
More common in middle-­age and older men.
Insidious onset of myelopathy with back pain and constitutional symptoms.
Serum lactate dehydrogenase may be elevated.
CSF: lymphocytic pleocytosis, markedly elevated protein, and hypoglycorrhachia. OCBs and
IgG index are absent. Cytologic analysis may demonstrate malignant cells (large-­volume CSF
examination can increase the diagnostic yield).
MRI: T2 hyperintensity, gadolinium enhancement, cord swelling, conus medullaris involvement, and
concomitant brain lesions.

Intravascular lymphoma

Predominantly affects vessels in the skin and neurologic system.
May mimic TM and even LETM.
CSF: lymphocytic pleocytosis and increased protein, but no malignant cells.
MRI: affects the conus medullaris (unlike TM).

Radiation myelitis

Early radiation myelopathy: begins 10-­16 wk after starting radiotherapy with predominantly sensory
phenomena (including Lhermitte sign) and typically resolves spontaneously.
Delayed radiation myelopathy: begins months or years after radiation exposure and manifests as a
subacute or insidious myelopathy.
Concurrent use of chemotherapeutic agents may cause widespread white matter necrosis owing to
synergistic toxicity.
Preexisting myelopathy from any cause may be risk factors for radiation myelitis.
MRI: cord swelling on T1-­weighted images, intramedullary T2 hyperintensity, ringlike gadolinium
enhancement.

likely to be complete. Necrosis and irreversible injury may occur in a
small but important number of cases. Potentially associated underlying etiologies include systemic vasculitic entities (e.g., SLE), antibody-­
mediated CNS disorders (e.g., AQP4-­Ab– or MOG-­Ab–associated
NMOSD), infectious etiologies (e.g., mycoplasma, enterovirus), or
idiopathic disease. Pathology and imaging studies show acute inflammation with demyelination in some cases.

Acute Flaccid Myelitis

Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is an idiopathic neurologic disorder presenting with acute weakness and/or paralysis in previously healthy
children. It is predominantly of infectious etiology. Although many
viruses have been implicated, the recent biennial outbreaks since 2014
are likely to have been caused by enterovirus-­D68. Abnormalities are
often seen in the lower motor neurons of the anterior horn gray matter

(Fig. 640.4). Symptoms can progress rapidly; paralysis is often asymmetric and is not usually accompanied by a sensory deficit; cranial
nerve involvement may include facial weakness, dysarthria, and dysphagia (Table 640.7).
In the United States, AFP is considered a generalized “umbrella”
term for multiple clinical entities, including paralytic poliomyelitis,
transverse myelitis, AFM, Guillain-­Barré syndrome, toxic neuropathy,
and muscle disorders. Essentially, this grouping helps with case ascertainment of AFM, but the individual diagnoses still remain important
because each has its own differential diagnoses to consider.
A pragmatic case definition of AFP is “a clinical syndrome with rapid
onset of weakness that frequently involves the respiratory and bulbar
muscles.” Whenever these criteria are met and poliomyelitis is a possibility, thorough investigation and reporting of potential poliomyelitis
is required. Two diagnostic stool samples more than 24 hours apart
should be collected within 14 days of onset of paralysis and then processed in a World Health Organization–approved laboratory. If poliomyelitis is confirmed, it may be caused by wild poliovirus (serotypes
1-­3) or vaccine-­associated paralytic poliomyelitis, and it will need full
epidemiologic investigation. In the individual patient, disease progression with paralysis (with sensory preservation) is rapid, asymmetrical,
and involves proximal more than distal muscles.
Other potential viral causes of AFP include coxsackie and echoviruses, Japanese B encephalitis, Murray Valley encephalitis, St. Louis
encephalitis, and Russian spring encephalitis, tickborne viruses, and
herpes virus. These causes vary by geography with, for example, EV-­
A71 being the cause in parts of Southeast Asia and West Nile virus
being a cause in the United States. Therefore consider the following
investigations for possible viral causes of AFP, as well as other conditions in the differential diagnosis:
• Imaging with MRI of the spine (and possibly brain)
• CSF sampling for differential cell counts, glucose, and protein;

microbiology and diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing
for enteroviruses and other infectious diseases; and for autoantibodies such as anti–myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (anti-­MOG, see
later)
• Respiratory/nasopharyngeal secretion samples for viral PCR testing
(e.g., enterovirus)
• Peripheral neurophysiology with nerve conduction studies (NCS) if
differentiation from GBS is needed or botulism is suspected
• Studies for identification of possible metabolic disease (e.g., acute
hypokalemic periodic paralysis, thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, acute
intermittent porphyria) and/or toxin exposures (e.g., sporadic hypokalemic paralysis secondary to licorice, barium, or cottonseed oil
exposure)
• Investigations to exclude paralytic syndromes that mimic or are
misdiagnosed as AFP, such as vitamin B12 deficiency, which may be
exacerbated by chronic cycad poisoning from evergreens, cyanide
toxicity from cassava ingestion, and lathyrism.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF TM

TM is often preceded within the previous 1-­3 weeks by a mild nonspecific illness or minimal trauma. Discomfort or overt pain in the neck or
back is common. Depending on its severity, the condition progresses
to numbness, anesthesia, ataxia, areflexia, and motor weakness in the
truncal and appendicular musculature at or distal to the lesion. Paralysis begins as flaccidity (paraparesis, tetraparesis). Spasticity then develops over weeks, accompanied by hyperreflexia and clonus. Weakness
may rarely be unilateral, but usually such a finding suggests a hemicord
lesion, which is most often associated with MS (particularly in adolescence). Urinary retention is a common early symptom; incontinence
occurs later in the course. Early sensory findings may be isolated to
the posterior column, necessitating evaluation of vibratory sensation.
Progressive sensory loss may manifest as anesthesia, paresthesia, or

allodynia. Other potential findings include priapism, respiratory compromise, and spinal shock with subsequent autonomic dysreflexia.
Rarely an overlap syndrome of TM with features of Guillain-­Barré syndrome may occur.

DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION

TM is a diagnosis of exclusion, and a thorough evaluation should
be completed in all cases. The differential diagnoses include, among
others, Guillain-­Barré syndrome, demyelinating disorders, systemic
rheumatologic conditions, meningitis, infectious myelitis, spinal cord
infarction, arteriovenous malformations, trauma, mass lesions, bony
and intervertebral disk distortion, abscess, and tumors of the spine and
spinal cord (see Tables 640.5 and 640.6).
MRI with and without contrast enhancement is essential to rule out
a mass lesion. T1-­weighted images of the spine at the anatomic level of
involvement may be normal or show spinal cord distension. In the infantile form, T2-­weighted images show high signal intensity over multiple
spinal segments. In the adolescent form, the high signal is often centrally
located and involves both gray and white matter. It may be limited to one
or two segments but is frequently more extensive. A limited degree of
gadolinium contrast enhancement is expected (especially in the infantile form) and is indicative of an inflammatory condition. Cervical and
cervicothoracic lesions represent most acute TM lesions. Axial cuts of
the spinal cord are invaluable and can help to establish potential etiologies. Hemicord involvement may indicate MS. Holocord involvement
with typical brain and optic nerve involvement suggests NMOSD. If

gray matter involvement predominates, consider a vasculitic or infectious process (e.g., SLE or enterovirus). Nerve root enhancement is occasionally seen and should raise suspicion for a mixed picture (central and
peripheral demyelination) or anterior horn cell involvement (Fig. 640.5).
Up to 6% of cases do not show spinal cord lesions on MRI. Repeat imaging at 7 days may reveal atrophy in these cases. MRI of the brain is also
indicated. Evidence of other foci of demyelination is seen in at least 40%
of patients; lesion localization should guide further consideration for
MS, ADEM, NMOSD, SLE, and enterovirus-­associated acute flaccid
myelitis. In any child with encephalopathy, ADEM must be considered.
Lumbar puncture is indicated after exclusion of a mass on MRI and
should be analyzed for cells, protein, immunoglobulin index, OCBs,
and infectious pathogens. Mononuclear cells are usually elevated in
TM. Protein may be elevated or normal. The presence of CSF inflammatory cells is essential for the diagnosis of TM.
Because one of the most important possibilities for this condition is
NMOSD, the serum and CSF of all patients should be analyzed for both
AQP-­4 and MOG antibodies. Older children should also have serum
studies sent for other autoimmune disorders, particularly SLE.

TREATMENT

Treatment of childhood TM has not been standardized. Available
evidence suggests immune response modulation may be effective in
reducing the severity and duration of disease. High-­dose steroids (i.e.,
methylprednisolone) are used acutely in TM. In cases of poor response
to high-­dose steroids, other acute therapeutic approaches include

intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and plasma exchange (PLEX).
Rituximab may be considered if an antibody-­driven TM is suspected.
Long-­term prophylactic therapy is recommended for children with
either relapsing disease or biomarkers indicating a risk for recurrence.

PROGNOSIS

Older children with acute TM have a better outcome than adults,
with nearly 50% making a good recovery by 2 years. This may
reflect the higher likelihood of MOG-­

640.4 Multiple Sclerosis
Michael Perry and Cheryl Hemingway
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating autoimmune disorder of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. It exhibits a relapsing-­
remitting course of neurologic events without encephalopathy separated
in time (i.e., more than one episode of at least 24 hours at least 30 days
apart) and space (i.e., in more than one CNS region). When occurring
in those under 18 years, it is known as pediatric-­onset MS (POMS).
Recurrent events lead to a characteristic accumulation of physical disability, cognitive impairment, and brain atrophy.

EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS

MS is rare in childhood. In northern countries such as the United
Kingdom and Canada, the annual incidence is estimated at 2 children
per million. Interestingly, 5% of adult MS patients report in retrospect
that they first experienced symptoms before age 18. POMS affects prepubescent males and females equally, but after puberty there is a 2:1
female predominance. Childhood MS is almost invariably relapsing-­
remitting in nature; features suggestive of primary progressive MS
should prompt careful specialist evaluation for alternative conditions
(Table 640.8).
In adults, a complex interplay of environmental (e.g., low sunlight exposure, low vitamin D, obesity, toxins), infectious (e.g., EBV

exposure), and genetic/epigenetic factors (e.g., HLADRB1*15:01
homozygosity) are thought to synergistically influence MS susceptibility. Studies in pediatric MS have so far confirmed the role of some of
the earlier factors; however, the rarity of MS, the modest effects of a
multitude of candidate risk factors, and the near ubiquity of EBV in
the general population have made identification of causality and quantification of risk challenging. A landmark study of U.S. military service
members, however, has provided the best evidence yet that EBV infection, long postulated as a putative cause of MS, precedes the onset of
disease and confers a 32-­fold increase in the risk of disease development. B cells, then, a reservoir of latent EBV infection, may help to
explain the effectiveness of anti-­CD20 DMTs in MS and provide a target for future therapeutics or vaccines.

PATHOGENESIS

Dysregulation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems is at
the heart of MS pathogenesis. The precise sequence of events leading
to aberrant production of autoreactive immune cells is not well understood. Restriction of inflammation to the CNS suggests the presence of
a CNS autoantigen. How and where an immune response (i.e., B-­and
T-­cell activation) to a purported autoantigen is initiated is unclear; it
is possible that CNS antigens migrate into the peripheral lymph nodes
(via antigen-­presenting cells) where autoreactive T and B cells become
activated or that the triggering antigen is derived from the periphery
itself (e.g., systemic infection). Clonal cells targeting the brain and
spinal cord initiate a self-­perpetuating deleterious cycle of inflammation, axonal demyelination, and astrocytic gliosis, and eventual axonal
degeneration occurs in both white and gray matter. It is this axonal
degeneration that directly contributes to permanent disability. DMTs
target inflammatory infiltrates within actively demyelinating lesions
of relapsing-­remitting MS in an attempt to attenuate this cycle before
axonal loss.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Presenting symptoms are polyregional in more than half of patients.
These include focal sensory loss or other paresthesia (39–63%); cerebellar symptoms such as ataxia or dysarthria (50%); unilateral (and
sometimes bilateral) painful eye movement and reduced visual acuity
(ON) (37%); brainstem symptoms in 30%; and motor deficits in up to
50%. Such motor dysfunction can manifest as focal deficits, hemiparesis, paraparesis, and bowel/bladder dysfunction (from TM or other
spinal lesions). Except in cases of significant brainstem involvement,
encephalopathy is not a feature.

MS patients. In NMOSD, OCBs are usually either negative (type 1
pattern) or present in both CSF and serum (type 4 pattern). Evoked
potential studies can localize disruptions in visual, auditory, or somatosensory pathways.

DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

Pediatric MS can usually be diagnosed after two demyelinating episodes
without encephalopathy. Episodes must localize to one of four distinct
CNS regions, last longer than 24 hours, and be separated by more than
30 days. Importantly in pediatric MS, there must exist no other plausible explanation for the symptoms. MRI may serve as a surrogate for
recurrent demyelination, thereby enabling MS diagnosis after the first
clinical event so long as it demonstrates dissemination in space (at least
two T2 lesions involving juxtacortical, periventricular, infratentorial,
or spine regions) and time (presence of gadolinium-­enhancing lesion
and nonenhancing T2 lesion in the same scan). A 10-­year longitudinal
study demonstrated that 96% of children diagnosed with POMS met
2017 McDonald criteria at presentation. Alternatively, MS can be diagnosed with a follow-­up MRI at any time interval that exhibits accumulation of T2 or gadolinium-­enhancing lesions in the brain or spine. The
2017 McDonald diagnostic criteria allow the presence of intrathecal
OCBs to substitute for dissemination in time (see Table 640.1). Challenges may arise in distinguishing a first attack of pediatric MS from
other acquired demyelinating syndromes, particularly those associated
with antibodies (e.g., AQP4-­Ab, MOG-­Ab) or ADEM (Table 640.9
and see Table 640.4). Although irritability and lethargy may be present
(particularly with brainstem lesions), encephalopathy is a highly atypical feature of MS, and one should be extremely cautious in making this
diagnosis in a child with such symptoms. Indeed, the 2017 McDonald criteria’s positive predictive value (PPV) was shown to be reduced
because of the relative predominance of ADEM compared with MS in
the under-­12-­years cohort. The absence of encephalopathy is therefore
required to make a diagnosis of MS in this age-­group.

3733

PROGNOSIS

Reliable prognostication in POMS remains a challenge for several reasons. The first is the long time over which the disease progresses. The
second is the disconnect between inflammatory activity (e.g., lesion
accumulation, relapse rate) and neuronal/axonal degeneration, which
more directly corresponds to disability. Pediatric MS studies before
widespread DMT use suggested a higher relapse rate but slower rate
of disability accumulation compared with adults. Despite this longer
interval to irreversible disability (20-­30 years), pediatric MS patients
acquire disability at a younger age than adults owing to the earlier age
of onset of disease. Indeed, emerging evidence suggests the plasticity of
the young brain likely accounts for the relative delays in disability accumulation and cognitive impairment. Nonetheless, like adults with MS,
pediatric MS patients can acquire fixed neurologic deficits affecting the
visual and other cranial nerves, motor and sensory function, balance,
and bowel/bladder function. Children with MS have also been shown
to have an overall smaller head size and brain volume that can be
attributed to gray matter degeneration. Despite the marked reduction
in annualized relapse rate (ARR), lesion load, and overall inflammatory burden compared with interferon-­beta-­1α, children treated with
fingolimod still lost brain volume and failed to achieve age-­expected
brain volume increase. This underscores the difficulty in addressing
cognitive impairment, which is increasingly recognized and present in
up to 50% of young people with POMS, more than that seen in adult-­
onset MS.
Fatigue is also a major symptom in pediatric MS that can lead to a
poor quality of life. It is important to address this in a multidisciplinary
setting together with other factors, such as mood, sleep quality, and
sleep hygiene. Pharmacologic management of fatigue is challenging,
but psychology-­based therapy with cognitive-­behavioral therapy and
pacing has been shown to be effective.

TREATMENT

Relapses causing functional disability may be treated with intravenous
methylprednisolone 20-­30 mg/kg/day (maximum 1000 mg/day) for
3-­5 days, with or without prednisolone taper. It should be noted that
a study in adults demonstrated noninferiority of oral vs intravenous
methylprednisolone in acute relapses in MS.
DMTs reduce both relapse frequency and T2 lesion load by targeting elements of the inflammatory response that predominates during
the relapsing-­remitting phase of MS. There is an increasing number
of immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive treatment options
available. They include injectables, oral medications, and infusions.
The choice and sequencing of medications are becoming increasingly
highly specialized (Table 640.10). Nearly all DMT use in pediatrics is
currently off-­label, though several randomized controlled trials are in
progress. The only medication with FDA approval at the present time
is fingolimod. One trial comparing oral fingolimod with intramuscular
interferon-­beta-­1α demonstrated that fingolimod reduced the annualized relapse rate by 82% when compared with interferon-­beta-­1α in
children between 10 and 18 years of age. This efficacy is greater than
that seen in adults, possibly because of the greater inflammatory burden in POMS. This is but one of the reasons that prompt initiation of
treatment is recommended for all those diagnosed with POMS.
An ongoing debate about DMT use concerns escalation vs induction—that is, whether to start with safer, less efficacious first-­line agents
and only escalate if treatment fails or whether remission should first
be induced with the more aggressive and effective treatments before
then maintaining on safer medications. Adult trials to answer this
question are underway, and currently, the more efficacious treatments
are generally reserved only for those with highly active MS. However,
the increased inflammatory activity, higher relapse rate, and young age
at which disability occurs in POMS have inspired research to investigate the theorized benefits of high-­efficacy early treatment (HEET).
One effectiveness study of DMTs in pediatric MS provided evidence
in favor of HEET, having demonstrated marked superiority of high-­
efficacy medications in preventing both relapses and new brain lesions.

640.5 Myelin Oligodendrocyte
Glycoprotein–Associated Disorders
Michael Perry and Cheryl Hemingway
Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody–associated disease
(MOGAD) encompasses a group of demyelinating disorders characterized by IgG autoantibodies to the MOG glycoprotein expressed in
the outer layer of the myelin sheath. MOG antibodies are present in
about 40% of all children with acquired demyelinating syndromes at
first presentation. This increases to half of children with ADEM and
nearly all those with relapsing ADEM (MDEM).
There is considerable phenotypic overlap between MOGAD, MS, and
AQP4-­
Ab–positive NMOSD. Children with MOG-­
Ab seropositivity
have often been classified as early MS or NMOSD; emerging evidence
is drawing lines of demarcation between these entities. This paradigm
is owed primarily to improved MOG-­Ab assay techniques and specific
clinical phenotypic description; differences in symptomatology, epidemiology, disease course, treatment response, prognosis, and histopathology between MOGAD, MS, and AQP4-­Ab–positive NMOSD have been
described. MOGAD may be either monophasic or relapsing; both MS
and AQP4-­NMOSD are characterized by a relapsing course. MOGAD
has also demonstrated age-­dependent variation of phenotype not seen in
either MS or AQP4-­NMOSD. Indeed, a minority of children with MOG
antibodies may fit strict clinical and imaging criteria for a diagnosis of
NMOSD with MOG (see Chapter 640.6). Most MOG-­positive children
(∼60%) previously classified as NMOSD would no longer fit this criterion and thus represent a cohort distinct from NMOSD.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION

There are four main clinical phenotypes of MOGAD: (1) ADEM, (2) ON, (3)
TM (NMOSD: ON and TM sequentially or simultaneously), and (4) cortical
encephalitis. These may be monophasic or relapsing in nature, such as is seen
with relapsing inflammatory optic neuritis (RION) or ADEM followed by

optic neuritis (ADEM-­ON) (see Table 640.1). Tumefactive lesions, cerebellar
demyelination, cranial neuropathies, monofocal or polyfocal cerebral motor
deficits, and occasionally a widespread progressive leukodystrophy-­like pattern may also be seen. Children with cortical encephalitis may present with
seizures, headache, fever, and cortical symptoms with cortical hyperintensities on T2-­weighted MRI sequences. Symptoms may be preceded by a viral
prodrome, but no pathogens have been causally linked.
The diagnostic guideline of the International MOGAD Panel requires
fulfillment of three criteria (Table 640.11):
1.	Presence of one of six core clinical demyelinating events: optic
neuritis, myelitis, ADEM, cerebral monodical or polyfocal deficits,
brainstem or cerebellar deficits, or cerebral cortical encephalitis
2.	Serum MOG-Ab positivity
3.	Exclusion of MS and other demyelinating syndromes

globally, high positivity is reliably predictive of true MOG-­Ab positivity. Low-­positive or borderline results less reliably differentiate
MOG-­Ab disease from other entities and should prompt reconsideration of other diagnoses, particularly MS. Fixed CBAs may be
used with some caution if live CBA is not available, but enzyme-­
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) should be avoided. Although
useful for diagnostic purposes, MOG-­Ab titer levels are unhelpful
in predicting risk of relapse.
Intrathecal OCBs are not normally present. However, OCB positivity should not preclude a diagnosis of MOG in the presence of
supportive clinical features (particularly TM) and high MOG-­IgG
antibodies. Elevated CSF white blood cells with pleocytosis is often
present.

IMAGING AND LABORATORY FINDINGS

Treatment of acute attacks is similar to other demyelinating disorders:
high-­dose methylprednisolone, PLEX, and IVIG. Most children with
MOGAD will experience a monophasic course and thus should not be
offered DMT after a first event.
There is currently no clarity about DMTs that may be helpful over
the long term and in relapsing disease. A complicating factor is the
potential for long intervals between relapses. This makes it exceedingly
difficult to determine the true efficacy of DMTs and guide early decisions about initiating treatment. Some studies have even demonstrated
an exacerbation of MOG-­Ab disorders treated with traditional MS
medications, highlighting again the importance of an accurate clinical
diagnosis.
The decision to use long-­term immunosuppressive agents after
induction therapy can be difficult. Unlike MS and AQP4-­NMOSD,
MOGAD may be monophasic or relapsing. At present, reliable
predictors for risk of relapse do not exist. Therefore children with
MOGAD are assessed holistically to determine the appropriateness
of chronic therapy based on the risk:benefit ratio of each individual
patient. This may include the severity of initial presentation, response
to acute treatment, recovery from index attack, and likelihood of
relapse. In children assessed as likely to benefit from DMTs, medications such as mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine are frequently

MRI findings are atypical for MS (Fig. 640.7 and see Fig. 640.3).
Brain MRI may show widespread involvement of the supratentorial
and infratentorial white matter that can over time develop into a
leukodystrophy-­like pattern. This may extend into the pons, middle
cerebellar peduncle, medulla, or deep gray matter. Spinal imaging
suspicious for MOG-­Ab disease may show longitudinally extensive myelitis, a characteristic H-­sign of the central cord, or a lesion
of the conus medullaris. Accrual of MRI lesions in the absence of
relapse (i.e., clinically silent), a hallmark of MS, is not a typical feature of MOGAD. MRI of the optic nerves can be particularly useful
in discrimination of phenotype and may show specific findings that
together may indicate MOG-­Ab disease. These include perineural
sheath enhancement, papilledema, bilateral ON, and longitudinal
nerve involvement. Previously attributed to those with POMS, these
findings are now recognized as hallmarks of MOG-­Ab–associated
disease.
Suspected cases should have serum tested for MOG antibodies
via live CBA for the IgG Fc or IgG1 secondary antibodies; importantly, laboratories should ideally report both quantitative (i.e.,
titers) and qualitative results (i.e., low-­positive or high-­positive)
(Fig. 640.8). Despite variation in assay protocols across laboratories

offered. This can be done with or without steroids. Rituximab has
been used with some reports of benefit. However, there have also
been concerning cases of severe exacerbations despite B-­cell depletion, particularly in those with relapsing brainstem demyelination. It
is important to remember that although both AQP4 and MOG disorders are antibody-­driven, the former is an astrocytopathy, whereas
the latter is an oligodendrocytopathy. Therefore extrapolation of
treatment effects from one condition to the other is not necessarily
possible. Monthly IVIG is the only treatment to date to consistently
have shown benefit in high-­risk individuals. However, there is great
promise in new treatments such as satralizumab, an anti-­IL-­6 antibody, and anti-­neonatal Fc receptor antibodies, which aim to reduce
levels of pathogenic autoantibody by blocking IgG recycling.

PROGNOSIS

MOGAD is generally associated with a more benign course and
favorable recovery compared with AQP4-­Ab demyelination. Dramatic resolution is often seen in as little as 30 days on follow-­up
MRIs. MOGAD is particularly heterogenous, however, and certain phenotypes such as brainstem demyelination can have a very
high relapse rate. Progression of disability is directly related with
relapse rate, and therefore predictors of relapse rate is a focus of
intense research. Approximately one third of MOG-­p ositive children will relapse within 8 years of the first presentation. This
risk is slightly higher in MOG-­related ON and lower in isolated
TM. Relapses can also occur many years after the first event, with
intervals of more than 10 years having been reported. Cognitive
deficits are seen frequently in those with young onset and frequent
relapses.

640.6 Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum
Disorders
Michael Perry and Cheryl Hemingway
The neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSDs) are severe
autoimmune inflammatory diseases classically characterized by episodes
of ON and/or longitudinally extensive TM. The discovery of pathogenic
antibodies to the astrocyte water channel protein aquaporin-­4 (AQP4)
and the incorporation of these antibodies into the 2015 revised diagnostic criteria for NMOSDs have helped to distinguish AQP4-­Ab–related
disorders from other demyelinating conditions; it has also widened the
spectrum of the group of disorders to include brainstem syndromes
(e.g., area postrema syndrome) and recurrent forms of ON and TM (see
Table 640.1). MOG-­Ab has also been identified in many cases that were
initially thought to have been AQP4-­antibody–negative presentations.
Reports of both antibodies being simultaneously present in a single individual are exceedingly rare; in these circumstances, a diagnosis of AQP4­Ab–positive NMOSD should take precedence and guide management.

EPIDEMIOLOGY

AQP4-­Ab–positive NMOSD typically presents in older adults, whereas
MOG-­Ab NMOSD is much more common in children and young people. Both, however, can occur across a wide age spectrum. Population
studies vary significantly but suggest a pediatric incidence for NMOSDs
of 0.5–4.5% of all ADS presentations. AQP4-­Ab–driven NMOSD is significantly more common in females than in males. NMOSD appears to
have a higher mortality rate in Black people. Most cases of NMOSD are
idiopathic; only occasionally have familial cases have been reported.
Several genetic risk factors have been described, including the HLA-­
DRB1*0301 allele and a single-­nucleotide polymorphism in CD58.

myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein [MOG] antibody associated diseases in children and adults. Front Neurol. 2020;11:Article 960, Fig. 1.)

PATHOGENESIS

The water channels against which the AQP4-­IgG antibody is directed
are most abundant on the astrocyte foot processes within the periventricular regions, brainstem, optic nerves, and spinal cord; thus strictly
speaking, NMOSD can be characterized as an autoimmune astrocytopathy with secondary demyelination. Antibody (primarily IgG1 subtype) binding occurs at the extracellular loops of the AQP4 protein.
This activates the classical complement pathway with C5b-­C9 component, stimulating leukocyte migration and degranulation, ultimately
resulting in astrocytic death. Chemokine secretion from the dying
astrocytes and activated leukocytes further attract additional macrophages, leading to oligodendrocyte and neuronal death. Subsequent
necrosis or cavitation may occur.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

AQP4-­positive NMOSD presents most commonly with ON, TM, or
area postrema syndrome (i.e., hiccups, nausea, and/or intractable vomiting); vomiting is highly unusual in MOG-­Ab NMOSD. The symptoms and signs of TM depend on the spinal level and completeness of
the inflammatory changes. ON or TM may occur simultaneously or
may be separated in time by weeks or even years. Some patients, particularly in MOG-­Ab NMOSD, present with seizures and encephalopathy mimicking ADEM. Others exhibit endocrinopathies such as the
syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH),

diabetes insipidus (DI), hyperinsulinemia, disrupted puberty, or obesity. NMOSD may also be associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as SLE, Sjögren syndrome, diabetes mellitus (DM), and
thyroiditis.

IMAGING AND LABORATORY FINDINGS

Neuroimaging studies must include the entire spine, optic nerves if
visual symptoms are present, and brain. Although often manifesting
with large, hazy, ill-­defined white matter lesions and/or gray matter
involvement, such as thalamic lesions, brain imaging may have only
subtle white matter changes, or even be normal. Brain lesions most
frequently localize to areas of high AQP4-­Ab expression such as the
periaqueductal gray matter, dorsal brainstem, and diencephalon (Fig.
640.9). Spinal imaging may reveal short or longitudinally extensive TM;
longitudinally extensive ON involving the chiasm is more common in
MOG-­Ab disease. Imaging does not reliably differentiate AQP4-­Ab
and MOG-­Ab. Both, however, are readily distinguished from MS by
the absence of discrete, well-­defined oval lesions in the periventricular
white matter.
Although AQP4-­Ab and MOG-­Ab can be found in both the serum and
CSF, their relative increased prevalence in the serum suggests extrathecal
production of antibody. There are several different methods of varying
sensitivity for antibody testing; the gold standard is the live CBA. Repeat
testing is advised in cases of high clinical suspicion of an antibody-­driven

brain and spinal cord MRI. If MRI findings are considered to be typical or suggestive of adult MS, then the McDonald diagnostic criteria should be
applied. In children whose MRI is not typical or suggestive of MS but who have clinical and radiologic features suggestive of NMOSD, AQP4-­Ab
testing is recommended. In particular, this test is advised in children presenting with an area postrema syndrome, MRI abnormalities localized to the
brainstem and hypothalamus, and destructive lesions. If AQP4-­Ab is negative, then MOG-­Ab should be tested. In children whose MRI is not typical
of MS or NMOSD but the clinical and radiologic presentation has features of ADEM, MOG-­Ab testing is recommended. Supporting features for
MOG-­Ab–associated disease include lesions in the cerebellar peduncle and leukodystrophy-­like MRI pattern in the very young. Alternative diagnoses should be considered in the remaining Ab-­negative patients. (From Hacohen Y, Mankad K, Chong WK, et al. Diagnostic algorithm for relapsing

a longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) lesion extending over three or more vertebral segments. A, Sagittal T2-­weighted MRI of the
thoracic spinal cord demonstrates a typical LETM lesion involving most of the thoracic spinal cord (arrows). LETM lesions have a predilection for the
central cord, as shown by axial T2-­weighted (B; arrowhead) and T1-­weighted MRIs with gadolinium (C; arrowhead). Cervical LETM may extend into
the medulla, a characteristic NMOSD pattern demonstrated in D (arrows; sagittal T2-­weighted MRI) and E (arrows; sagittal T1-­weighted MRI with
gadolinium). Acute LETM lesions can be associated with intralesional hypointensity, as shown by sagittal T1-­weighted MRI (F; arrow); in this example,
a rim of gadolinium enhancement surrounds the hypointense region. Chronic sequelae of LETM may include longitudinally extensive segments of
spinal cord atrophy, as shown by T2-­weighted MRI using the sagittal plane (G; the two arrowheads indicate the atrophic segment, and the top arrow indicates the normal diameter of unaffected cervical spinal cord) and axial plane (H; arrowhead shows an atrophic spinal cord). Fast spin echo

disorder despite a negative test. CSF typically reveals elevated white blood
cells (WBCs) and, unlike in MS, is usually negative for OCBs.

DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

The International Panel for NMO Diagnosis (IPND) published new
criteria for NMOSD in 2015. Emphasis is now placed on the presence or absence of AQP4 antibody (see Table 640.1). In seropositive
patients (after exclusion of alternative diagnoses), only one core clinical
criterion is required from the following six: (1) ON, (2) TM, (3) area
postrema syndrome, (4) acute brainstem syndrome, (5) narcolepsy or
diencephalic syndrome with compatible MRI lesions, and (6) symptomatic cerebral syndrome with typical brain lesions. If AQP4-­Ab
negative, the diagnosis is more stringent and two core clinical criteria
are required, one of which must be ON, longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), or area postrema syndrome. The heterogenous
nature of this seronegative cohort suggests that further antibodies are
yet to be discovered and likely represent multiple subgroups.
The differential diagnoses include other demyelinating disorders,
such as MS or ADEM; vasculitis and rheumatologic disorders, including SLE, Behçet disease, and neurosarcoidosis (usually accompanied by
other nonneurologic manifestations); idiopathic TM, tropical spastic
paraparesis, and viral encephalomyelitis (none of which have NMO
antibodies in the serum or CSF); genetic disorders such as familial
HLH or pathogenic variants in DARS; metabolic causes such as biotinidase deficiency and riboflavin-­responsive conditions; idiopathic
causes of isolated ON; or other acute forms of monocular or binocular
visual loss (Table 640.12; see also Chapter 671). Additional considerations include lymphoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, tuberculosis,
and vitamins B12 and E deficiencies.

TREATMENT

In principle, treatment of NMOSD involves acute treatment with early
aggressive antiinflammatory therapy (e.g., steroids) and removal of the
antibody (PLEX or monoclonal) and longer-­term relapse prevention
with DMTs.
Initial episodes and relapses may be treated acutely with methylprednisolone 20-­30 mg/kg/day (maximum 1,000 mg/day) usually for
5 days; this can be extended for severe attacks. An oral taper (though
there is no consensus regarding length) is recommended, particularly if antibody results are not available at the time of discharge. In
certain circumstances, treatment escalation in the acute phase may
be indicated: for example, when minimal or no improvement is seen
with steroids, or even initially in patients deemed to be high-­risk (i.e.,
brainstem symptoms or ON in a child with preexisting deficit in the
contralateral eye). In these cases, PLEX either before or after IVIG (2
g/kg over 2-­5 days) with a repeat course of steroids may be considered.
Rituximab can be used both acutely and to prevent further relapses.
In adults, AQP4-­Ab–positive NMOSD has historically been treated
with a range of DMTs, including azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil
(MMF), and rituximab. A study of satralizumab (interleukin [IL]-­6
reuptake inhibitor of T-­and B-­cell activation, Th17 differentiation, and
plasmablast survival) in NMOSD demonstrated clear benefit in pediatric patients, particularly those who were AQP4-­Ab–positive, and it is
licensed for use in children in the United States and Canada. Preliminary evidence in adults suggests that eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the C5 complement protein, reduces recurrence and may
improve disability in patients with severe NMOSD. A pilot study of
tocilizumab, an anti–IL-­6 monoclonal antibody, demonstrated efficacy
in AQP4-­NMOSD in adults. Inebilizumab, an anti-­CD19 antibody,
has been shown to effectively ameliorate multiple NMOSD endpoints
(time to relapse, disability scores, new MRI lesions) in adults and is
now in pediatric clinical trials. Importantly, medications used for the
treatment of MS are ineffective and can even exacerbate relapses, again
highlighting the criticality of accurate diagnosis.

PROGNOSIS

The relapsing and aggressive nature of AQP4-­positive NMOSD in pediatric patients very often results in poor recovery and a progressive accrual
of disability. MOG-­Ab–positive NMOSD is more likely to be monophasic. In relapsing phenotypes (either AQP4-­Ab or MOG-­Ab), the relapse

Chapter 641

Pediatric Stroke
Nomazulu Dlamini and Gabrielle A. deVeber
Stroke is an important cause of acquired brain injury in newborns, children, and adolescents. The ischemic varieties of arterial ischemic stroke
(AIS) and cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) are, together, more
common than brain malignancy (incidence ∼5 in 100,000 children per
year). Perinatal ischemic stroke is especially common (1 in 2,500-­4,000
live births) and is the leading cause of hemiparetic cerebral palsy. Beyond
ischemic stroke, a similar number of children have hemorrhagic stroke
(HS) and other forms of cerebrovascular disease. Acute stroke is a neurologic emergency; unfortunately, delays in recognition are common, and
delayed treatment worsens outcomes. In comparison with stroke in adults,
there is a more diverse group of disorders producing stroke in neonates
and children.

641.1 Arterial Ischemic Stroke
Nomazulu Dlamini and Gabrielle A. deVeber
Arterial blood reaches the brain via the anterior (internal carotid) and
posterior (vertebrobasilar) circulations, converging at the circle of

Willis. Strokes most often involve the middle cerebral artery territory
but can occur in any cerebral artery of any size. AIS is the focal brain
infarction that results from occlusion of these arteries.
The diagnosis of stroke in children is frequently delayed. This is a
consequence of subtle and nonspecific clinical presentations, poor
awareness by primary care physicians, a complicated differential
diagnosis for hemiparesis (see Chapter 641.5), and a high frequency
(>50%) of negative initial brain CT scans in true AIS. The acute onset
of a focal neurologic deficit in a child is stroke until proven otherwise.
The most common focal presentation is hemiparesis, but acute visual,
speech, sensory, or balance deficits also occur. Importantly, new-­onset
seizures, especially focal motor seizures, frequently herald stroke,
especially in infants and younger children. Children with these presentations require urgent neuroimaging and consultation with a child neurologist because emergency interventions may be indicated. AIS is a
clinical and radiographic diagnosis. Although CT imaging can demonstrate mature AIS and exclude hemorrhage, cerebral MRI is required to
identify early and small infarcts and disorders of the cerebral arteries.
Diffusion-­weighted MRI demonstrates AIS from minutes to 7 days
after the onset; MR angiography can confirm vascular occlusion and
suggest possible arteriopathy (Fig. 641.1). Diffusion-­weighted MRI can
also demonstrate Wallerian degeneration in the descending corticospinal tract, which correlates with chronic hemiparesis.
Many possible risk factors for childhood AIS are recognized (Tables
641.1-­641.3), although their specific pathophysiologic mechanisms
remain poorly understood. Half of children with AIS are healthy
before stroke onset. Three main categories of etiology should be considered: arteriopathy, cardiac disease, and hematologic disease (see
Table 641.1). Hence, in addition to a careful history taking and physician examination, a full investigation (including vascular imaging,

regarding AIS pathogenesis at the time of presentation because it may
be indistinguishable from intracranial dissection or early moyamoya
disease. FCA can be subclassified as FCA inflammation type, FCA dissection type, and undetermined FCA.
Arterial dissection can be spontaneous or posttraumatic and
involves extracranial (carotid, vertebral) arteries more frequently than
intracranial arteries. Moyamoya demonstrates progressive occlusion
of the distal internal carotid arteries. It may be idiopathic (moyamoya
disease) or associated with other conditions (moyamoya syndrome)
such as sickle cell anemia, neurofibromatosis type 1, trisomy 21, William syndrome, Alagille syndrome, chromosomal microdeletions/
microduplications, and disorders after irradiation (Fig. 641.3). Diffuse,
bilateral, progressive vasculitis is rare and can represent progressive

childhood primary angiitis of the CNS or occur in association with
systemic vasculitides (Table 641.4; see also Chapter 642). Cranial infections (e.g., bacterial or tuberculous meningitis) also produce infectious arteritis and thrombophlebitis of surface vessels. Congenital/
genetic disorders of craniocervical arteries include PHACES (posterior fossa abnormalities, hemangioma, and arterial, cardiac, eye, and
sternal abnormalities) syndrome, fibromuscular dysplasia, or CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy, subcortical infarcts,
and leukoencephalopathy). ACTA2, COL4A1, and ADA2 gene variants
may be associated with AIS, and new genetic arteriopathic conditions
are steadily being added to this list. Hence, targeted genetic testing and
whole exome sequencing are recommended (see Table 641.2). Vasospasm, as occurs in migraine, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or reversible

cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (sometimes called Call-­Fleming
syndrome), can cause AIS. Metabolic strokes are seen in organic acidemia, methylmalonic acidemia, propionic acidemia, isovaleric acidemia, glutaric aciduria type II, mitochondrial encephalomyopathies,
MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes), MERRF (mitochondrial encephalopathy with ragged
red fibers), MERRF/MELAS overlap syndrome, and Kearns-­
Sayre
syndrome.
Cardioembolic stroke makes up approximately 25% of childhood
AIS cases, with the maximal embolic risk concurrent with interventional catheterization, surgical repair, or ventricular assist device use.
AIS complicates approximately 0.5% of pediatric cardiac surgeries,
and reoperation increases the risk. Although complex congenital
heart diseases are most frequently associated with AIS, acquired
conditions, including arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, and infective
endocarditis, should also be considered. A patent foramen ovale

provides a possible conduit for paradoxical venous thromboembolism to the brain. All children with suspected AIS require a thorough
cardiovascular examination, an electrocardiogram, and an echocardiogram. Prothrombotic coagulation disorders and infection identified at the time of the index cardiogenic stroke increase the stroke
recurrence risk.
Hematologic disorders associated with AIS include sickle cell anemia, in which the stroke risk is increased 400-­fold, although effective
screening (using transcranial Doppler) and transfusion therapy have
reduced the incidence. Iron-­deficiency anemia also increases the risk
and is easily treatable. Coagulation disorders are associated with childhood AIS. They include hereditary (e.g., factor V Leiden) and acquired
(e.g., antiphospholipid antibodies, lipoprotein-­a elevation) prothrombotic states and prothrombotic medications, including oral contraceptives and asparaginase chemotherapy. Additional AIS risk factors
include migraine, acute childhood illnesses, chronic systemic illnesses,
illicit drugs and toxins, and rare inborn errors of metabolism.
Treatment of childhood AIS is multifaceted, and multiple consensus-­
based guidelines are available. The safety and efficacy of thrombolysis and/
or thrombectomy in children with AIS has only been reported anecdotally. Nonetheless, some pediatric stroke centers offer thrombolysis with or
without thrombectomy for pediatric patients with AIS. Most candidates are
preteen or adolescent patients with AIS; younger children may also be candidates for thrombolysis but often have mimics of stroke and must be evaluated
carefully for other diagnoses. In adults, treatment with both thrombolysis
(~4.5 hours) and endovascular thrombectomy (~16-24 hours) results in
improved functional outcome. Pending additional data, for younger children (e.g., <5 years age who often have comorbidities, e,g., congential heart
disease), thrombectomy treatment should probably be avoided.
Early initiation of antithrombotic strategies is paramount to prevent
early reinfarction. Depending on the suspected cause, this includes
anticoagulation with heparin or antiplatelet strategies, usually aspirin.
Hyperacute neuroprotective strategies are essential to initiate within
minutes in suspected stroke because they prevent progressive ischemic
brain injury. These include control of blood glucose (avoid hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia) and temperature (avoid hyperthermia,
maintain normal temperature) and maintenance of adequate cerebral
perfusion (avoid hypotension and hypertension) and oxygenation.
Urgent treatment of seizures is an important neuroprotective strategy, including possible monitoring with continuous electroencephalography (EEG). Early malignant infarct edema is life-­threatening,
more common in children, and predictable, and emergency surgical
decompression can be lifesaving. Disease-­specific treatments include
transfusion therapy in sickle cell disease, immunosuppression in
vasculitis, and revascularization surgery in moyamoya. Long-­term

and intellectual impairments, behavioral and social disabilities, and
epilepsy. Long-­term attention to arterial health lifestyle factors is also
important. Outcomes after childhood AIS include recurrent stroke in
10–50%, depending on the cause and preventive treatment, death in
2–6%; neurologic deficits in 60–70% (usually mild); and seizure disorders long-­term in 30%.
Adolescents and young adults with idiopathic (cryptogenic) AIS and
a patent foramen ovale (PFO) may benefit from percutaneous PFO closure to prevent a recurrent stroke.

PERINATAL ARTERIAL ISCHEMIC STROKE

Perinatal stroke is common. It differs from childhood stroke, and it
has two distinct clinical presentations. Acute symptomatic neonatal
AIS presents with focal seizures within 24-­28 hours of birth (Fig.
641.4 and see Table 641.3). Cranial ultrasound frequently misses
the diagnosis of AIS. MRI diffusion abnormalities in an arterial territory confirm recent infarction. Alternatively, some affected neonates are asymptomatic at birth and present in later infancy with
signs of early hand preference and congenital hemiparesis. Hand
dominance within the first year of life is abnormal and may be the
result of perinatal stroke. Imaging reveals focal encephalomalacia in
an arterial territory, typically porencephaly in the middle cerebral
artery territory.
In acute neonatal AIS, seizure control is important, but antithrombotic agents are rarely required because recurrent stroke is
rare; the exceptions are neonates with congenital heart disease and
cardiac embolism, prothrombotic disorders, and, perhaps, those
with congenital arterial anomalies (stenosis, hypoplasia). The
pathophysiology is complex and poorly understood. Most are idiopathic, although established causes include congenital heart disease,
thrombotic placentopathy, and meningitis. The role of prothrombotic conditions in noncardiac neonatal AIS is controversial, but
they likely play an additive role alongside other risk factors. Many
other maternal, prenatal, perinatal, obstetric, and neonatal factors
have been investigated with several strong associations found (e.g.,
chorioamnionitis, infertility, primiparity, monozygotic twins). Outcomes include normal or mild deficit in ∼50% of children; however,
∼25% of children have significant long-­term disabilities. Perinatal
stroke accounts for most cases of hemiparetic cerebral palsy (congenital hemiplegia, see Chapter 638.1). Additional morbidity, seen
in ∼25%, includes disorders of language, learning, cognition, and
behavior and longer-­term epilepsy. Stroke recurrence rates in subsequent pregnancies are extremely low in the absence of a familial
prothrombotic disorder.

641.2 Cerebral Sinovenous Thrombosis
Nomazulu Dlamini and Gabrielle A. deVeber
Cerebral venous drainage occurs via the cerebral sinovenous system. The
superficial system (i.e., cortical veins, superior sagittal sinus) and deep system (i.e., internal cerebral veins, straight sinus) converge at the torcula to
exit the cranial vault via the paired transverse and sigmoid sinuses and jugular veins. In cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT), thrombotic occlusion of these venous structures can create regional or diffuse increased
intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, and, in 50% of cases, venous infarction or hemorrhage (venous stroke). CSVT is more common in children
than in adults, and risk is greatest in the neonatal period (Table 641.5).
Clinical presentations are typically gradual, variable, and nonspecific compared with AIS. Neonates often present with encephalopathy and seizures. Children may present with symptoms mimicking

idiopathic intracranial hypertension, including progressive headache,
papilledema, diplopia secondary to sixth cranial nerve palsy, or acute
focal deficits. Seizures, lethargy, and confusion are common. Diagnosis
requires a high clinical suspicion and specifically requested imaging of
the cerebral venous system. Nonenhanced CT is insensitive in detecting CSVT, and so either contrast CT venography or MR venography is
necessary to demonstrate filling defects in the cerebral venous system
(Fig. 641.5). MRI offers superior parenchymal imaging compared with
CT.
Table 641.5 lists the risk factors for CSVT. Prothrombotic states
associated with childhood CSVT include inherited conditions (e.g.,
prothrombin gene mutation of 20210A) and acquired conditions (e.g.,
antiphospholipid antibodies), prothrombotic medications (e.g., asparaginase, oral contraceptives), and common childhood illnesses (e.g.,
otitis media, iron-­deficiency anemia, and dehydration). Systemic diseases associated with increased risk of CSVT include leukemia, inflammatory bowel disease, and nephrotic syndrome.
Head and neck disorders can directly involve cerebral veins and
sinuses thereby causing CSVT. Common infections, including

meningitis, otitis media, and mastoiditis, can cause septic thrombophlebitis of venous channels. CSVT can complicate head trauma especially in veins/venous sinuses adjacent to skull fractures. Neurosurgical
procedures in proximity to cerebral venous structures may also lead to
injury and CSVT. Finally, obstruction of the jugular veins and proximal
stasis may result in CSVT. In neonates, because the cranial sutures are
unfused, mechanical distortion of the underlying venous sinuses may
occur and predispose to CSVT either during labor and delivery or with
supine lying because of occipital bone compression of the posterior
sagittal sinus.
Anticoagulation therapy plays an important role in childhood CSVT
treatment. Substantial indirect evidence has led to a consensus recommendation for anticoagulation with unfractionated or low molecular weight heparins in most children. The presence of hemorrhagic
venous infarcts is not an absolute contraindication. Treatment is usually planned for 6 months, although if reimaging at 3 months confirms
recanalization, treatment is usually discontinued. However, anticoagulation of neonates is more controversial, and guidelines differ. Evidence

suggests that 30% of untreated neonates and children will extend their
thrombosis in the first week after diagnosis, and additional venous
infarction can result. Therefore if anticoagulation is withheld, early
(e.g., 5-­7 days) repeat venous imaging is paramount. Protocols supporting initial anticoagulation recommend shorter treatment durations (i.e., 6 weeks to 3 months) in neonates. Children with persistent
risk factors may require prophylactic long-­term anticoagulation. At
initial diagnosis, supportive interventions include management of
infection, detection and treatment of seizures, and neuroprotective
measures (e.g., normothermia, normotension, normovolemia, normoglycemia). Compressive optic neuropathy secondary to prolonged
increased intracranial pressure after CSVT is an important complication that can lead to permanent visual loss. Regular funduscopic
examination by an ophthalmologist and treatment directed at reducing
intracranial pressure (e.g., acetazolamide, serial lumbar puncture) may
be required. Most neurologic morbidity is suffered by those incurring
venous infarction. Consistent with other forms of childhood stroke, a
comprehensive neurorehabilitation program is required.

restriction may be helpful in distinguishing ischemic thromboembolic
abnormalities from inflammatory TM.

Clinical Manifestations

Similar to inflammatory TM, patients present with acute onset of
motor weakness accompanied by sensory abnormalities. The weakness progresses over minutes to hours. Pain or discomfort localized
to the back or neck, depending on lesion localization, is frequent, with
rapid progression of motor weakness and early areflexia reflecting spinal shock. Spasticity, hyperreflexia, and clonus occur in the ensuing
weeks. A sensory level and motor weakness are present distal to the
lesion, with urinary symptoms, including urinary retention, a frequent
occurrence.

641.3 Spinal Cord Lesions Associated with
Vascular Processes
Nomazulu Dlamini and Gabrielle A. deVeber
Most cases of transverse myelitis (TM) in childhood are postinfectious or, if recurrent, are associated with underlying demyelinating
processes, such as multiple sclerosis (see Chapter 640.4) or neuromyelitis optica (see Chapter 640.2). However, in a small proportion of
children presenting with acute spinal cord symptoms, infarction and
necrosis may occur. This pathology may be associated with disease of
the vessels, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)–associated
vasculitis (see Chapter 199) or other vascular events such as embolism
(including nucleus propulsus embolism–fibrocartilaginous embolism).
Rarely, arteriovenous malformations of the spinal cord may exist and
may cause myelopathy and infarction with hemorrhage in the spinal
cord. An acute onset and a peak of symptoms over minutes to hours
suggest a vascular process.

VASCULITIC PROCESSES: SYSTEMIC LUPUS
ERYTHEMATOSUS

Most cases of SLE-­associated myelitis are longitudinally extensive,
and although reports in pediatric populations are rare, the disorder can occur. In 23–60% of cases, myelitis may be the first clinical
manifestation of lupus and in many cases occurs at times of low
systemic SLE disease activity. Poor recovery is frequent in these
cases, with only 14% of patients experiencing complete recovery. In
children, other vasculitic etiologies of cord disease, such as Bechet
disease, exist.

SPINAL CORD EMBOLISM

Other rare etiologies of an acute increased T2 signal on a spinal cord
MRI presenting clinically as TM include cord infarction caused by
thromboembolism, either the result of fibrocartilaginous embolism or
originating from a lower segment vertebral artery dissection or aortic
dissection at the artery of Adamkiewicz. Ischemic myelopathy caused
by a vertebral artery dissection occurs in the cervical spine; however,
fibrocartilaginous embolism may occur anywhere in the spinal cord. A
hyperacute onset and lesion appearance (wedge-­shaped distribution)
together with MRI diffusion-­
weighted imaging showing diffusion

Investigations

MRI of the spinal cord, including T1-­and T2-­weighted axial as well
as sagittal cuts with gadolinium, are necessary to evaluate for the presence of a focal spinal cord lesion. Given the frequency of longitudinally
extensive lesions in myelopathy in pediatric populations, both cervical
and thoracic spine imaging should be included in all patients presenting with acute TM. Inclusion of imaging sequences sensitive for hemorrhage (gradient echo sequences) may help, as will diffusion sequences.
The inclusion of brain MRI scans, including associated vascular imaging of head and neck vessels, are useful to evaluate the possibility of
large-­vessel disease. In the event of a cervical spine lesion combined
with ischemic brain lesions in the distribution of the posterior circulation, vertebral artery dissection should be investigated.
Lumbar puncture can be performed once MRI evaluation has ruled
out a severe cord expansion or mass leading to complete spinal column
block. Although inflammatory TM may be associated with elevations
in the CSF white blood cells (WBCs) and protein, ischemic myelopathy
caused by embolism does not show an acute pleocytosis. However, in a
vasculitic event such as myelopathy associated with SLE, increased CSF
protein and WBCs may be present.
Serum testing for the presence of underlying rheumatologic disorders should be performed in patients presenting with TM. A workup
for hypercoagulable states should also be performed in cases with a
high suspicion for ischemic myelopathy.

TREATMENT

In addition to supportive care, treatment is directed at the suspected
underlying disease process. Given the low likelihood of complete
recovery in ischemic lesions of the spinal cord and the significant disability associated with spinal cord injury, when underlying etiologies
such as SLE are found, prophylactic treatment is recommended. Supportive care, including pain control for neuropathic pain, spasticity
management, and management of urinary symptoms, is frequently
required in this population. When vascular abnormalities are identified or if ischemic myelitis is the suspected cause, low-­dose aspirin (2-­4
mg/kg/day) for prevention of recurrence may be indicated.

641.4 Hemorrhagic Stroke
Nomazulu Dlamini and Gabrielle A. deVeber
HS includes nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage and is classified by
the intracranial compartment containing the hemorrhage. Intraparenchymal bleeds may occur in any location within the brain’s substance.
Intraventricular hemorrhage may be isolated within ventricles or an
extension of intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Bleeding outside the brain
may occur in the subarachnoid, subdural, or epidural spaces.
Clinical presentations vary according to location, cause, and rate
of bleeding. Acute hemorrhages may feature instantaneous or thunderclap headache, loss of consciousness, and nuchal rigidity in addition to focal neurologic deficits and seizures. HS can be rapidly fatal.
In bleeds associated with vascular malformations, pulsatile tinnitus,

cranial bruit, macrocephaly, and high-­output heart failure may be
present. The diagnosis relies on imaging, and CT scanning is highly
sensitive to acute HS. However, lumbar puncture may be required to
exclude subarachnoid hemorrhage. MRI is highly sensitive to even
small amounts of both acute and chronic hemorrhage and offers
improved diagnostic accuracy (Fig. 641.6). Angiography by CT, MR,
or conventional catheterization means is often required to exclude
underlying vascular abnormalities (e.g., vascular malformations,
aneurysms).
Abusive head trauma with intracranial bleeding in children may
present as primary subdural or parenchymal hemorrhage with no
apparent history of trauma. Clinicians should search for the following:
subtle scalp, suborbital, or ear bruising; retinal hemorrhages in multiple layers; and chronic failure to thrive. In infants with subdural bleeds,
x-­rays should be performed to rule out fractures. Epidural hematoma
is nearly always caused by trauma, including middle meningeal artery
injury typically associated with skull fracture. Subdural hematoma can
occur spontaneously or with trivial trauma in children with brain atrophy because of stretching of bridging veins.
Causes of and risk factors for HS (Table 641.6) include vascular
malformations and systemic disorders. Arteriovenous malformations are the most common cause of childhood subarachnoid and
intraparenchymal HS and may occur anywhere. Neonates with vein
of Galen malformations may present with heart failure, progressive
macrocephaly, or, rarely, hemorrhage. In older children with arteriovenous malformations, the risk of bleeding is approximately 2–4%
per year throughout life. Somatic gene variants in KRAS have been
noted in some patients with arteriovenous malformations of the

brain. Other vascular malformations leading to HS include cavernous angiomas (cavernomas), dural arteriovenous fistulas, and vein of
Galen malformations (Fig. 641.7). Cerebral cavernous malformations
may be sporadic or familial (autosomal dominant) and associated
with gene variants in the CCM1, CCM2, or CCM3 genes. Cerebral
aneurysms are a less common cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage
in children and may suggest an underlying disorder (e.g., polycystic
kidney disease, infective endocarditis) (Fig. 641.8 and Table 641.7).
A common cause for HS is bleeding from a preexisting brain tumor.
Arterial diseases that usually cause ischemic stroke, including fibromuscular dysplasia, vasculitis, intracranial dissection, and moyamoya, can also predispose to HS. Additional causes of parenchymal HS
include hypertensive hemorrhage and hematologic disorders such
as thrombocytopenic purpura, hemophilia, acquired coagulopathies
(e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, liver failure), anticoagulant therapy (e.g., warfarin), or illicit drug use. Ischemic infarcts
may undergo hemorrhagic transformation, particularly in CSVT, and
may be difficult to differentiate from primary HS.
Management of acute childhood HS requires emergency neurosurgical intervention for a large or rapidly expanding hemorrhage. The
same principles of neuroprotection for vulnerable brain suggested in
the AIS sections also apply to HS. Reversal of anticoagulant therapy
(with, for example, vitamin K, fresh-­frozen plasma) may be required.
The recurrence risk for those with structural lesions is significant, and
serial imaging may be required. Definitive repair or removal of the
vascular malformation may require a combined approach with interventional endovascular methods and neurosurgery. Outcomes from
childhood HS are not well studied but likely depend on lesion size,

Neonatal HS has unique features. Cranial ultrasound can detect many
neonatal parenchymal bleeds, especially in the preterm infant, where
bleeds are located centrally within the cranium including germinal
matrix bleeding and intraventricular hemorrhage, and in the cerebellum (see Chapter 122.3). Germinal matrix injury or bleeding may also
occur in utero, resulting in periventricular venous infarction that presents in later infancy as chronic hemiparesis. Subarachnoid and subdural
blood are common postpartum in normal-­term newborns and may be
detected by imaging in up to 25%. Term newborn HS is poorly studied

641.5 Differential Diagnosis of Strokelike
Events
Nomazulu Dlamini and Gabrielle A. deVeber
The diagnosis of stroke in childhood requires a high index of suspicion
balanced with awareness of the differential diagnosis for strokelike events
(Table 641.8). An acute onset of a focal neurologic deficit should be considered a stroke until proven otherwise and assessed with urgent neuroimaging. However, pediatric stroke must also be differentiated from other
strokelike disorders that may require their own urgent specific treatment.

MIGRAINE

A careful history and examination can often suggest migraine as the
cause of acute focal deficits (see Chapter 635.1). Neurologic deficits

3753

associated with migraine typically evolve slowly compared with stroke,
with sensory disturbance or weakness marching across body areas over
minutes. Migraine auras should last between 5 and 60 minutes and
resolve completely. Although evolution into a headache is expected
in migraine, headache may also accompany true AIS. Furthermore, a
group of uncommon “acephalic” migraine subtypes can occur without
headache and can more closely mimic stroke in children. These entities
include familial hemiplegic migraine, basilar migraine, and migraine
aura without headache. Migraine can also (rarely) cause a stroke,
referred to as migrainous infarction.
Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) presents
in patients with a history of migraine, pregnancy, or exposure to drugs
(sympathomimetic agents, SSRIs, migraine abortive agents). There is
both multifocal arterial constriction and dilation producing intense
(thunderclap) headache, migraine-like symptoms, seizures, or focal

3754 Part XXV u The Nervous System
neurologic deficits (stroke). MRI is useful in differentiating RCVS
from other disorders, especially primary angiitis of the central nervous
system.

SEIZURE

Prolonged focal motor seizure activity is typified by stiffening or jerking movements, termed positive symptoms frequently followed by a
period of focal neurologic deficit (so-­called Todd paresis), which typically resolves rapidly over hours after the seizure (see Chapter 633).
Very rarely, focal seizures can manifest with only “negative” symptoms
producing only hemiparesis or other acute-­onset focal neurologic deficits. A known history of seizures and epileptiform EEG findings may
be helpful. Urgent brain imaging should be considered in new cases
of prolonged or recurrent focal seizure with persisting Todd paresis
because stroke in children is often associated with seizures at onset.

INFECTION

Life-­threatening and treatable brain infections, including abscess, bacterial meningitis, and herpes encephalitis, can be mistaken for stroke
(see Chapter 643). However, symptom onset in primary CNS infection is typically more gradual and less focal with fever as a consistent
feature. Children with bacterial meningitis are at risk for both venous
and arterial stroke.

DEMYELINATION

Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, clinically isolated syndrome,
multiple sclerosis, and other demyelinating conditions can present
with acute focal neurologic deficits (see Chapter 640). The symptom
onset and initial progression are, however, more gradual compared
with stroke onset (i.e., typically hours or days versus minutes). Multifocal deficits, or concurrent encephalopathy in the case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, decreases the probability of stroke.

HYPOGLYCEMIA

Acute lowering of blood glucose levels can produce focal deficits mimicking stroke. New-­onset hypoglycemia in otherwise healthy children
is rare, but predisposing conditions include insulin-­dependent diabetes, adrenal insufficiency, steroid withdrawal, and ketogenic diet.

GLOBAL HYPOXIC-­ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY

Generalized reduction in cerebral perfusion can produce focal areas
of watershed brain infarction, which, when asymmetric, can mimic
vasoocclusive forms of stroke. Watershed ischemic injury should be
accompanied by recognized hypotension or conditions predisposing to
low cerebral perfusion, such as sepsis, dehydration, or cardiac dysfunction. Clinical presentations tend to be generalized and include bilateral
cerebral dysfunction compared with stroke, and the anatomic location
of the infarct on MRI or CT scanning is in typical bilateral watershed
zones rather than conforming to an established arterial territory.

HYPERTENSIVE ENCEPHALOPATHY

Posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome is seen in children
with hypertension, often in the context of an acute rise in blood pressure. The posterior regions are selectively involved, possibly resulting
in symptoms of bilateral cortical visual dysfunction in addition to
encephalopathy and seizures.

INBORN ERRORS OF METABOLISM

Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-­
like episodes (MELAS; see Chapter 638.2) is the classic example of a
metabolic strokelike condition, though other mitochondrial diseases
can mimic stroke. Features favoring MELAS include a history of developmental regression, deafness, posterior (and often bilateral) lesions
not respecting vascular territories on MRI, and elevated serum or CSF
lactate on MR spectroscopy. In contrast to these types of metabolic
infarctions, children with Fabry disease (see Chapter 653.6), hyperhomocysteinemia, and homocystinuria (see Chapter 105.4) are at risk of
true ischemic stroke.

VESTIBULOPATHY AND ATAXIA

Acute-­onset vertigo and/or ataxia can be confused with brainstem or
cerebellar stroke. Simple bedside tests of vestibular function with otherwise intact brainstem functions are reassuring. This differential diagnosis includes acute vestibular neuronopathy, viral labyrinthitis, and
the benign paroxysmal vertigos, as well as acute postviral cerebellar
ataxia and episodic ataxias.

CHANNELOPATHIES

An increasing number of nervous system ion channel mutations are
described that feature sudden focal neurologic deficits, thereby mimicking stroke. These include the migraine syndromes, as well as a growing list of episodic ataxias. A strong family history raises suspicion, but
most require additional investigation.

ALTERNATING HEMIPLEGIA OF CHILDHOOD

Alternating hemiplegia of childhood typically presents in late infancy
with acute intermittent episodes of hemiplegia that alternate from one
side of the body to the other. The hemiplegia persists for minutes to
weeks and then resolves spontaneously. Choreoathetosis and dystonic
movements are commonly observed in the hemiparetic extremity. Signs
spontaneously regress with sleep but recur with awakening. Affected
children may also experience sudden attacks of redness and warmth
(i.e., flushing) or unusual paleness (i.e., pallor) of the skin occurring
during or separately from episodes of hemiplegia. Almost all affected
individuals have some level of developmental delay and intellectual
disability that typically progresses over time. Neuroimaging, including
MRA, should be completed to exclude moyamoya disease. Alternating
hemiplegia of childhood is linked to variants in the ATP1A3 gene.

Chapter 642

Central Nervous System
Vasculitis
Sona Narula
Autoimmune-­mediated inflammatory brain diseases include primary
central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis, secondary CNS vasculitis,
and autoimmune encephalitis (Fig. 642.1; see Chapter 638.4).
Primary vasculitis or angiitis of the CNS (PACNS) is recognized as
an underlying etiology of a broad spectrum of neurologic and psychiatric symptoms in children. Criteria characteristic of primary angiitis of
the CNS in childhood (cPACNS) include (1) newly acquired focal and/
or diffuse neurologic deficits and/or psychiatric symptoms in a child
18 years of age or younger, plus (2) angiographic and/or histologic evidence of vasculitis in the absence of (3) a systemic underlying condition
known to cause or mimic the findings. Two broad categories of cPACNS
are recognized based on the predominant vessel size affected: large/
medium-­
vessel cPACNS and small-­
vessel cPACNS. Large/medium-­
vessel cPACNS is diagnosed by angiography demonstrating features of
vessel wall inflammation, such as wall thickening and resulting luminal
stenosis. Based on the clinical course and the corresponding distribution
of vessel stenosis within the vascular tree of the CNS, children with large/
medium-­vessel cPACNS are classified as having a monophasic, nonprogressive subtype (NPcPACNS) or a progressive subtype (PcPACNS).
The latter is characterized by chronic, progressive vessel wall inflammation affecting both proximal and distal vessel segments in one or both
hemispheres. In contrast, NPcPACNS is a monophasic illness; vessel
inflammation occurs in a characteristic distribution and is limited to

the proximal vessel segments of the anterior and/or middle cerebral
artery and/or distal internal carotid artery of one hemisphere. Small-­
vessel cPACNS (SVcPACNS) is considered a progressive illness; the
diagnosis is confirmed by brain biopsy, as angiography is typically
normal.
Secondary childhood CNS vasculitis can affect all cerebral vessel
segments and can occur in the context of infections, or rheumatic or
other inflammatory conditions, or as a result of systemic or local vascular irritation (Table 642.1). The neuropsychiatric manifestations of
secondary CNS vasculitis are the same as those of primary CNS vasculitis. Secondary CNS vasculitis is distinguished from primary CNS
vasculitis largely by the non-­CNS manifestations of the underlying systemic vasculitic disease.

EPIDEMIOLOGY

The incidence and prevalence of primary CNS vasculitis are undetermined. Increased physician awareness, improved diagnostic markers,
sensitive neuroimaging techniques, and utilization of brain biopsies
have led to dramatically increased recognition and decreased mortality rates. The disease has many names, including isolated angiitis of
the CNS, transient cerebral angiitis, postvaricella angiopathy, and focal
cerebral arteriopathy. Furthermore, children are frequently diagnosed
with their presenting clinical phenotype, such as stroke, movement
disorder, psychosis, or cognitive decline. Within clinical phenotypes
such as arterial ischemic stroke or status epilepticus in children without preexisting epilepsy, cPACNS should be considered an important
etiology.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Recognition of childhood CNS vasculitis requires a very high level
of suspicion because any neurologic or psychiatric presentation can
be the result of an underlying CNS vasculitis. The clinical phenotype
may provide clues to the size of the primarily affected vessel segments
and resulting cPACNS subtype: the majority of children with large/
medium cPACNS present with arterial ischemic stroke. Focal neurologic deficits, such as hemiparesis, facial droop, aphasia, or any other
distinct gross or fine motor deficits, may be the result of large-­vessel
inflammation causing stenosis and a decreased blood supply to the
specific functional areas of the brain. Initially, these focal deficits
wax and wane; they may even briefly resolve without therapeutic
intervention and can therefore be easily overlooked. Headaches can
be a symptom of vascular disease and are commonly reported in
cPACNS. New-­onset headaches in children without any family history of migraine can serve as a diagnostic clue. Cognitive dysfunction
in cPACNS often includes loss of higher executive function, concentration difficulties, learning and memory problems, atypical behavior
or personality changes, and loss of social and emotional control. Seizures are a hallmark of SVcPACNS, as more than 80% of children with

SVcPACNS present with seizures. In many centers, refractory status
epilepticus is increasingly recognized as the presenting phenotype of
SVcPACNS. Optic neuritis and spinal cord disease can also occur in
the setting of SVcPACNS.
Constitutional features of fever or fatigue may point toward an
underlying systemic illness causing a secondary CNS vasculitis. All
children with suspected or confirmed CNS vasculitis require a careful
assessment for a systemic illness.

DIAGNOSIS

The first step is considering vasculitis as a possible underlying etiology of newly acquired neurologic deficits and/or psychiatric symptoms
(Table 642.2). The likelihood of CNS vasculitis in general and a specific

subtype of CNS vasculitis in particular depends on the demographic
characteristics of the patient, the CNS and non-­CNS features of the
clinical presentation, the preceding symptoms, and the mode of onset
of the disease. SVcPACNS is more commonly seen in females, whereas
large/medium cPACNS has a clear male predominance. Seizures are a
hallmark of SVcPACNS, whereas strokes often reflect large/medium-­
vessel inflammation. Laboratory markers of vasculitis typically include
C-­
reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and complete
blood counts. However, inflammatory markers lack sensitivity and specificity in cPACNS, particularly when the CNS is involved in isolation.
More than 50% of children with large/medium-­vessel cPACNS have
normal inflammatory markers at diagnosis. In contrast, the majority
of children with SVcPACNS present with mild to moderately raised
markers. Von Willebrand factor antigen, an endothelial cell–derived
protein, is a proposed biomarker of vasculitis correlating closely with
disease activity in cPACNS. It may be of particular importance for
distinguishing SVcPACNS from demyelinating disorders. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is abnormal in up to 90% of SVcPACNS
patients and less than half of large/medium-­vessel cPACNS patients.
Within the latter group, children with the progressive subtype have a
higher likelihood of presenting with abnormal CSF findings, including elevated opening pressure, raised CSF cell count (typically with
lymphocyte predominance), and raised CSF protein. Oligoclonal
bands are positive in 20% of children with SVcPACNS. They are rarely
seen in other subtypes. Autoimmune encephalitis (see Chapter 638.4)
and anti–myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)–associated

encephalitis are two of the key neuroinflammatory differential diagnoses of SVcPACNS.
Neuroimaging is a valuable diagnostic modality for cPACNS.
Parenchymal lesions may be inflammatory or ischemic in nature
and are best viewed on MRI, including T2/fluid-­attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences and diffusion-­
weighted images
(DWIs) (Fig. 642.2). CNS lesions in children with large/medium-­
vessel cPACNS are predominantly ischemic in nature and restricted
to large vascular territories. In contrast, MRI lesions in children with
SVcPACNS are not restricted to major vascular territories; lesions
are primarily inflammatory and may enhance with contrast. In this
subtype, focal or generalized meningeal enhancement is commonly
seen if children are imaged before initiation of immunosuppressive
therapy.
Evidence of vessel stenosis confirms the diagnosis in large/medium-­
vessel cPACNS subtypes; brain biopsies are not required. Important
information about the disease activity can be obtained from post–
gadolinium contrast studies of the vascular wall. The vessel wall of
an inflamed cerebral vessel in active large/medium-­vessel cPACNS
subtypes is thickened and enhances contrast. Vessel wall enhancement may also be useful for the assessment of ongoing disease activity. Conventional angiography, when compared with MR angiography,
has a higher sensitivity in detecting vessel stenosis in the distal vessel
segments, the posterior circulation, and in very young children. Vessel
wall imaging is often normal in children with SVcPACNS, often mandating a brain biopsy to definitively confirm the diagnosis. Studies of
regional blood flow or therapeutic trials of antiinflammatory or immunosuppressive agents are nonsurgical alternatives that do not afford
specific diagnostic information.
If a biopsy is pursued, a targeted lesional biopsy is preferred if
an accessible lesion is identified on imaging. Biopsies should target
low-­risk, nonfunctional areas identified on MRI. In the appropriate
clinical context, nonlesional biopsies can also be done to confirm the
diagnosis of SVcPACNS and are typically taken from the nondominant frontal lobe. Diagnostic yield is improved if the biopsy is full
thickness and includes the meninges and gray and white matter and
if it is done before initiation of immunosuppression. In adults, one
study reported the diagnostic yield of biopsies for PACNS to be 11%,
with an identified alternative diagnosis reported in about 30% of
cases. In this study, smaller biopsies and closed procedures were less
likely to be diagnostic, and biopsy-­related complications occurred in
16% of patients.
Characteristic findings on biopsy in SVcPACNS include an intramural and/or perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, evidence of endothelial activation, and reactive astrocyte activation. Gliosis and
perivascular demyelination are hallmarks of long-­standing disease.
Hemorrhagic lesions have also been reported. Findings typically seen
in adult PACNS, including granulomas or vessel wall necrosis, are
less commonly seen in children with SVcPACNS. Disorders that may
be seen in adolescents and young adults that produce the reversible
vasoconstriction syndrome must also be considered. These include
migraine, drug-­
induced vasospasm, and postpartum angiopathy.
Differentiating vasculitis from these other etiologies is important for
therapy and prognosis (Table 642.3).

TREATMENT

Corticosteroids are the mainstay of acute immunosuppressive management of cPACNS. Usually pulse therapy is initially given. Antithrombotic therapy is equally important, particularly in large/
medium-­vessel cPACNS subtypes, because children are at high
risk for recurrent ischemic events. For the distinct cPACNS subtypes, different treatment regimens should be considered. Nonprogressive cPACNS is a monophasic inflammatory illness with
the highest risk of poor neurologic outcome. Vessel wall inflammation causes severe proximal stenosis and a high risk of stroke
recurrence. High-­dose corticosteroid pulses are commonly given,

followed by a 6-­to 12-­week course of oral steroids at tapering
doses. Second-­line immunosuppressive agents are uncommonly
used. All children require antithrombotic therapy, though no unifying regimen exists. Many centers initially use low molecular
weight heparin followed by long-­term antiplatelet therapy. When
reimaged at 3 months, children should have stable or improved
vessel disease, no newly affected vessel segments, and no evidence
of vessel wall enhancement. At this point, the immunosuppressive
therapy is commonly discontinued, and children are only kept on
antiplatelet therapy.
Progressive cPACNS and SVcPACNS are considered chronic progressive vasculitis subtypes requiring a prolonged course of combination immunosuppression. High-­dose corticosteroids are initially used,
followed by long-­term oral corticosteroids with a slow taper. Many
centers use an induction-­maintenance protocol, adding cyclophosphamide to corticosteroids (for 6 months), followed by mycophenolate
mofetil or other oral second-­line agents during maintenance therapy
(usually 18 months). Symptomatic therapy is essential, including
anticonvulsants or psychotropic medication if required. Supportive

therapy includes bone protection with calcium and vitamin D, prophylaxis against Pneumocystis pneumonia, and gastric mucosal protection
as required.

PROGNOSIS

The mortality rate of cPACNS has significantly improved. In large-­
vessel cPACNS, the risk of stroke recurrence is thought to be high in
patients who are found to have progression on vascular imaging at 12
months (especially if there was simultaneous progression and improvement occurring across multiple vessels).
Some treatment protocols for SVcPACNS report a good outcome,
defined as no functional neurologic deficits, in two thirds of children.
Children presenting with status epilepticus and SVcPACNS have the
poorest cognitive outcome. Multidisciplinary care involving neurology, rheumatology, hematology, and rehabilitation is ideal and may
improve outcomes.

3758 Part XXV u The Nervous System

Chapter 643

Central Nervous System
Infections
Andrew B. Janowski and David A. Hunstad
Infection of the central nervous system (CNS) is a significant cause of
morbidity and mortality in children. Identification of CNS infections
can be problematic for clinicians because symptoms can be nonspecific
in younger infants, and delayed or missed diagnosis can amplify the
morbidity and mortality rates associated with these diseases. Implementation of multiple conjugate vaccines has greatly reduced the incidence
of bacterial infections of the CNS. Nonetheless, bacterial and viral infections remain a significant cause of CNS disease, with atypical bacterial,
fungal, and parasitic pathogens also causing a smaller number of cases.
Independent of etiology, many patients with CNS infection have
similar clinical manifestations. Common symptoms include headache, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, photophobia, restlessness, altered
state of consciousness, and irritability. Common signs of CNS infection include fever, neck pain, nuchal rigidity, focal neurologic deficits,
seizures, obtundation, and coma. The severity and constellation of
signs are determined by host-­pathogen interactions and the affected
region of the CNS. Meningitis describes primary involvement of the
meninges, and encephalitis indicates brain parenchymal involvement. However, these anatomic boundaries may be indistinct during
infection, and many patients have clinical or imaging evidence of both
meningeal and parenchymal involvement. Terms such as meningoencephalitis may better describe diffuse infections of the CNS by pathogens such as viruses. Brain abscess is the most common example of a
focal infection of the CNS (see Chapter 644).
The diagnosis of CNS infection depends on a combination of imaging of the brain, testing the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and serologic methods and, in rare
situations, biopsy of brain tissue. Pending many of these tests, standard
CSF studies provide initial data to help guide selection of empiric antimicrobials. Table 643.1 provides an overview of the typical CSF abnormalities with various CNS disorders.

643.1 Acute Bacterial Meningitis Beyond
the Neonatal Period
Andrew B. Janowski and David A. Hunstad
Bacterial meningitis is one of the most serious pediatric infections
because it is associated with a high rate of acute complications and a risk
of long-­term morbidity and mortality. However, the use of antibiotics
and vaccines against the most common causes of bacterial meningitis
has significantly altered the spectrum of disease. In the 1980s, the most
common causes of bacterial meningitis in children older than 1 month
of age in the United States were Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The incidence of meningitis caused by all three organisms has been significantly reduced in
countries that have introduced universal immunization against these
pathogens. S. pneumoniae is now the most common cause of bacterial
meningitis in the United States. Demonstrating the impact of vaccination in the United States, invasive H. influenzae disease occurred in
67-­129 cases per 100,000 children under 5 years of age in the 1980s. By
2019, H. influenzae type b–associated diseases were exceptionally rare;
there were only 18 invasive cases in the United States, with a calculated
national rate of 0.08 cases per 100,000 children under 5 in the year
2017. Nonetheless, other serotypes of H. influenzae (particularly type
a and, rarely, other serotypes have emerged as a cause of meningitis).

EPIDEMIOLOGY

A major risk factor for bacterial meningitis is the lack of preexisting
immunity to specific pathogens and serotypes, reflected in a higher
incidence of meningitis in young infants. Additional risk factors include
recent colonization with pathogenic bacteria, close contact (household,
daycare centers, college dormitories, military barracks) with individuals having invasive disease caused by N. meningitidis or H. influenzae
type b, crowding, poverty, and male sex. The mode of transmission of
these pathogens is through contact with respiratory tract secretions or
droplets. The risk of meningitis is increased among infants and young
children with occult bacteremia; the odds ratio is greater for meningococcus (85 times) and H. influenzae type b (12 times) relative to that
for pneumococcus.
Indigenous Nation and Eskimo populations exhibit a higher incidence of bacterial meningitis because these populations have altered
immunoglobulin production in response to encapsulated pathogens.
Defects of the complement system (C5-­C8) are associated with recurrent meningococcal infection, and defects of the properdin system
are associated with a significant risk of lethal meningococcal disease.
Splenic dysfunction (e.g., in sickle cell anemia) or asplenia (caused by
trauma or a congenital defect) is associated with an increased risk of
pneumococcal, H. influenzae type b, and meningococcal sepsis and
meningitis. T-­lymphocyte defects (congenital or acquired by chemotherapy, AIDS, or malignancy) are associated with an increased risk of
Listeria monocytogenes infections of the CNS.
The risk of pneumococcal meningitis is increased in children with
congenital or acquired CSF leak across a mucocutaneous barrier, such
as a lumbar dural sinus, cranial or midline facial defects (cribriform
plate), fistulas of the middle ear (stapedial foot plate) or inner ear (oval
window, internal auditory canal, cochlear aqueduct), or CSF leakage
as a result of basilar or other skull fracture. The risk of pneumococcal
bacterial meningitis was historically increased by more than 30-­fold in
children with cochlear implants, though advances in implant design
have reduced this risk. Lumbosacral dermal sinus and myelomeningocele are associated with staphylococcal, anaerobic, and gram-­negative
enteric bacterial meningitis. CSF shunt infections increase the risk of
meningitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus spp. (S.
aureus and coagulase-­negative species), Cutibacterium spp. (formerly
Propionibacterium spp.), and other lower-­virulence bacteria that typically colonize the skin.

Streptococcus pneumoniae

See also Chapter 228.
Although the incidence of pneumococcal meningitis has been
reduced, S. pneumoniae remains the most frequently identified pathogen from cases of bacterial meningitis in the United States and in other
countries that have adopted similar vaccination strategies. The seven-­
valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was included in the
routine U.S. vaccination schedule in 2000 and contained serotypes 4,
6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F, responsible for ∼85% of invasive pneumococcal infections in the country. A dramatic decrease in the rate
of pneumococcal meningitis followed, from 8.2 cases per 100,000 in
1998-­1999 to 0.59 cases per 100,000 in 2004–2005. Similar reductions
were also identified in other nations that introduced this vaccine. However, this was followed by an increased incidence of invasive disease
caused by serotypes not contained in the original vaccine, known as
serotype replacement. In response, a 13-­valent pneumococcal conjugate
vaccine (PCV13) was licensed in the United States in 2010, containing
the serotypes in PCV7 plus serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A. Postmarketing surveillance data suggest the rate of invasive pneumococcal
infections has decreased further, though there are conflicting data as
to whether the rate of pneumococcal meningitis has decreased. Based
on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Active Bacterial Surveillance system, the incidence of invasive pneumococcal infections has fallen from 142.9 per 100,000 children under
age 1 in 1977 to 13.3 per 100,000 children under age 1 in 2018. Children with anatomic or functional asplenia secondary to sickle cell disease and those infected with HIV have infection rates that are 20-­to
100-­fold higher than those of healthy children in the first 5 years of

Neisseria meningitidis

See also Chapter 240.
Before universal H. influenzae type b vaccination in the United
States, approximately 70% of cases of bacterial meningitis occurring
in the first 5 years of life were caused by this pathogen. Invasive infections occurred primarily in infants 2 months to 2 years of age, the peak
incidence was at 6-­9 months of age, and 50% of cases occurred in the
first year of life. The risk to children was markedly increased among
household or daycare contacts of patients with H. influenzae type b
disease. Global vaccination efforts have also led to remarkable declines
in the incidence of this disease. Incompletely vaccinated individuals,
those in underdeveloped countries who are not vaccinated, and those
with immune-­compromising conditions remain at risk for H. influenzae type b meningitis. Other serotypes of H. influenzae (a, f) have been
associated with meningitis.

See also Chapter 237.
Six serogroups of meningococcus (A, B, C, X, Y, and W-­135) are
responsible for invasive disease in humans. Meningococcal meningitis may be sporadic or may occur in major epidemics, particularly in
the African meningitis belt, where serogroup A accounts for 80–85%
of outbreaks. In the United States, serogroup B is the most common
cause of meningitis in infants and is also a cause of outbreaks on college
campuses. Meningococcal cases are more common in the winter and
spring, likely because of associations with viral infections, including
influenza. Nasopharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis occurs in up to
15% of adults. Most infections in children are acquired from a contact
in a daycare facility, a colonized adult family member, or an ill patient
with meningococcal disease. Colonization may last weeks to months;
recent colonization places nonimmune younger children at greatest
risk for meningitis. The incidence of disease occurring in association
with an index case in the family is 1%, a 1,000-­fold increase in risk
in comparison to the general population. The risk of secondary cases
occurring in contacts at daycare centers is approximately 1 in 1,000.
Children under 5 years of age have the highest rates of meningococcal
infection, and a second peak in incidence occurs in persons between

PATHOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

A purulent exudate of varying thickness may be distributed around the
cerebral veins, venous sinuses, convexity of the brain, and cerebellum
and in the sulci, sylvian fissures, basal cisterns, and spinal cord. Ventriculitis with bacteria and inflammatory cells in ventricular fluid may
be present (more often in neonates) in addition to subdural effusions

and empyema. Perivascular inflammatory infiltrates may also be evident, and the ependymal membrane may be disrupted. Vascular and
parenchymal cerebral changes have been described at autopsy, including polymorphonuclear infiltrates extending to the subintimal region
of small arteries and veins, vasculitis, thrombosis of small cortical
veins, occlusion of major venous sinuses, necrotizing arteritis producing subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cerebral cortical necrosis in the
absence of identifiable thrombosis. Cerebral infarction is a frequent
sequela that is caused by vascular occlusion from inflammation, vasospasm, or thrombosis. The extent of an infarct may range from microscopic to an entire hemisphere.
Inflammation of spinal nerves and roots produces meningeal signs,
and inflammation of the cranial nerves produces cranial neuropathies
of optic, oculomotor, facial, and auditory nerves. Increased intracranial
pressure (ICP) also produces oculomotor nerve palsy because of temporal lobe compression of the nerve during tentorial herniation. Abducens nerve palsy may be an early nonlocalizing sign of elevated ICP.
Increased ICP is a result of cell death (cytotoxic cerebral edema),
cytokine-­induced increased capillary vascular permeability (vasogenic
cerebral edema), and increased hydrostatic pressure (interstitial cerebral edema) after obstructed reabsorption of CSF in the arachnoid
villus or obstruction of the flow of fluid from the ventricles. ICP may
exceed 30 cm H2O and cerebral perfusion may be further compromised
if the cerebral perfusion pressure (mean arterial pressure minus mean
ICP) falls below 50 mm Hg as a result of systemic hypotension. The
syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)
may produce excessive water retention and potentially increase the risk
of elevated ICP (see Chapter 597). Hypotonicity of brain extracellular
spaces may cause cytotoxic edema with cell swelling and lysis. Tentorial, falcine, or cerebellar herniation does not usually occur, because
the increased ICP is transmitted to the entire subarachnoid space and
there is little structural displacement. Furthermore, if the fontanels are
still patent, increased ICP is not always dissipated.
Hydrocephalus can occur as an acute complication of bacterial
meningitis because it is often caused by adhesive thickening of the
arachnoid villi around the cisterns at the base of the brain. Thus this
thickening leads to interference with the normal resorption of CSF and
development of hydrocephalus. Less often, obstructive hydrocephalus develops after fibrosis and gliosis of the cerebral aqueduct or the
foramina of Magendie and Luschka.
Elevated CSF protein levels are partly a result of increased vascular
permeability of the blood-­brain barrier (BBB) and the loss of albumin-­
rich fluid from the capillaries and veins traversing the subdural space.
Continued transudation may result in subdural effusions, usually
observed in the later phase of acute bacterial meningitis. Hypoglycorrhachia (reduced CSF glucose level) is attributable to altered glucose
transport by the cerebral tissue.
Damage to the cerebral cortex may be a result of the focal or diffuse effects of vascular occlusion (infarction, necrosis, lactic acidosis),
hypoxia, bacterial invasion (cerebritis), toxic encephalopathy (bacterial toxins), elevated ICP, ventriculitis, and/or transudation (subdural
effusions). These pathologic factors result in the clinical manifestations
of impaired consciousness, seizures, cranial nerve deficits, motor and
sensory deficits, and later, psychomotor retardation.

PATHOGENESIS

Bacterial meningitis outside the neonatal period is typically the result
of bacterial colonization of the nasopharynx with subsequent invasion
into the bloodstream, causing bacteremia. Circulating bacteria then
breach the BBB to cause CNS infection and inflammation.
Meningitic pathogens frequently colonize the nasopharynx of
asymptomatic children, but rapid invasion after recent colonization
may also occur. Bacterial proteins termed adhesins act to enhance colonization by enabling N. meningitidis and H. influenzae type b to attach
to mucosal epithelial cell receptors. The microbiome of the nasopharynx is a complex community of bacteria that may enhance or inhibit
colonization by other bacteria. S. pneumoniae can synthesize hydrogen
peroxide, which can inhibit growth of H. influenzae type b; conversely,
H. influenzae type b can invoke a specific immune response that targets

3761

clearance of S. pneumoniae. Other bacteria may alter the microbiome of
the nasopharynx, and studies after implementation of PCVs have identified alterations to the composition of nasopharyngeal bacterial populations. Viruses can also enhance bacterial adherence by a combination
of expression of viral factors that interact with host adhesion proteins.
After attachment to epithelial cells, bacteria may breach the mucosa
and enter the bloodstream. Various models of invasion have been
developed; N. meningitidis can be transported across the mucosal
surface within a phagocytic vacuole after ingestion by the epithelial
cell. Expression of the polysaccharide capsule in relevant bacteria also
appears to be tightly regulated, as it can enhance or inhibit the efficiency
of bacterial translocation across the mucosal barrier. Viral infection
can disrupt the mucosal barrier, thereby facilitating bacterial invasion; specifically, there is a significant association between recent influenza infection and development of meningococcemia. Once bacteria
reach the bloodstream, the capsule is a critical component for survival
because it interferes with opsonic phagocytosis. Host-­related immune
defects in bacterial opsonic phagocytosis can also allow bacteremia. In
nonimmune hosts, the defect may be from an absence of preformed
IgM or IgG anticapsular antibodies (as in an unimmunized toddler),
whereas deficiencies in components of the complement or properdin
system may preclude effective opsonic phagocytosis. Asplenia may also
hamper opsonic phagocytosis by the reticuloendothelial system.
There is a positive correlation between the bloodstream bacterial
titer and the accompanying risk of developing meningitis, suggesting that a critical threshold may be necessary for breaching the BBB.
Bacterial factors, including the capsule, play a role in crossing the BBB
through transcellular, paracellular, or Trojan horse (within infected
phagocytes) mechanisms. Bacteria gain entry to the CSF through the
choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles and the meninges and then circulate to the extracerebral CSF and subarachnoid space. Bacteria multiply rapidly because CSF concentrations of complement and antibodies
are inadequate to contain bacterial proliferation. Chemotactic factors
then incite a local inflammatory response characterized by polymorphonuclear cell (neutrophil) infiltration. The presence of lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) from gram-­negative bacteria (H. influenzae type
b, N. meningitidis) or of pneumococcal cell wall components (teichoic
acid, peptidoglycan) stimulates a marked inflammatory response, with
local production of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-­1, prostaglandin E, and other inflammatory mediators. The subsequent inflammatory response is characterized by neutrophilic infiltration, increased
vascular permeability, further compromise of the BBB, and vascular
thrombosis. Meningitis-­associated brain injury is not simply caused by
bacterial-­derived factors but also occurs as a consequence of the host
inflammatory cascade triggered by bacterial components.
Uncommonly, meningitis may follow bacterial invasion from a contiguous focus of infection such as paranasal sinusitis, otitis media, mastoiditis, orbital cellulitis, or cranial or vertebral osteomyelitis; or it may
occur after introduction of bacteria via penetrating cranial trauma,
dermal sinus tracts, or myelomeningocele.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

The onset of acute meningitis has two predominant patterns. Most
often, meningitis is preceded by several days of fever accompanied by
upper respiratory tract or, less often, gastrointestinal symptoms, followed by nonspecific signs of CNS infection, such as lethargy and irritability. Fortunately, the more dramatic presentation is less common
and features sudden and progressive shock, purpura, disseminated
intravascular coagulation, and reduced levels of consciousness, often
resulting in progression to coma or death within 24 hours.
The signs and symptoms of meningitis reflect the nonspecific findings associated with any systemic infection and the manifestations
of meningeal irritation. Nonspecific findings include fever, anorexia
or poor feeding, headache, upper respiratory symptoms, myalgias,
arthralgias, tachycardia, hypotension, and various cutaneous signs,
such as petechiae, purpura, or an erythematous macular rash. The
rash of meningococcemia is typified by an initial petechial rash that
evolves into ecchymotic and purpuric lesions. Meningeal irritation
is manifested as nuchal rigidity, back pain, Kernig sign (flexion of

the hip 90 degrees with subsequent pain upon extension of the leg),
and Brudzinski sign (involuntary flexion of the knees and hips after
passive flexion of the neck while supine). In children, particularly in
those younger than 12-­18 months, Kernig and Brudzinski signs are
not consistently present. In adults, fever, headache, and nuchal rigidity are present in only 40% of cases of bacterial meningitis. Increased
ICP is suggested by headache, emesis, bulging fontanelle or diastasis (widening) of the sutures, oculomotor (anisocoria, ptosis) or
abducens nerve paralysis, hypertension with bradycardia, apnea, or
hyperventilation, decorticate or decerebrate posturing, stupor, coma,
or signs of herniation. Papilledema is more common in complicated
meningitis and is suggestive of a chronic process, such as the presence of an intracranial abscess, subdural empyema, or occlusion of
a dural venous sinus. Focal neurologic signs usually are a result of
vascular occlusion. Cranial neuropathies of the ocular, oculomotor,
abducens, facial, and auditory nerves may also be the result of focal
inflammation. Overall, 10–20% of children with bacterial meningitis
have focal neurologic signs.
Seizures (focal or generalized) related to cerebritis, infarction, or
electrolyte disturbances occur in 20–30% of patients with meningitis.
Seizures that occur on presentation or within the first 4 days of onset
usually are of little prognostic significance. Poorer prognosis is suggested when seizures persist after the fourth day of illness, as these can
be refractory to treatment.
Alteration in mental status is common among patients with
meningitis and may be the consequence of increased ICP, cerebritis,
or hypotension; manifestations include irritability, lethargy, stupor,
obtundation, and coma. Comatose patients have a poor prognosis.
Additional manifestations of meningitis include photophobia and
tache cérébrale, which is elicited by stroking the skin with a blunt
object and observing a raised red streak within 30-­60 seconds.

DIAGNOSIS

Lumbar puncture (LP), to obtain CSF for Gram stain and culture, is the
most important step in the diagnosis of meningitis. Testing of the CSF
for neutrophilic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and/or reduced glucose
concentrations can yield results within a few hours and can indicate
bacterial meningitis (see Table 643.1). Contraindications to immediate LP include (1) evidence of increased ICP (other than a bulging
fontanel), such as third or sixth cranial nerve palsy with a depressed
level of consciousness, or the Cushing reflex (hypertension and bradycardia associated with respiratory abnormalities; see Chapter 630);
(2) severe cardiopulmonary compromise requiring prompt resuscitative measures for shock or in patients in whom positioning for the LP
would further compromise cardiopulmonary function; or (3) infection
of the skin overlying the site of the LP. Thrombocytopenia is a relative
contraindication for LP. If LP is delayed, empiric antibiotic therapy
should be initiated.
Some clinicians obtain a head CT scan before LP to evaluate for evidence of increased ICP because an LP in the setting of elevated ICP
may promote brain herniation. However, a head CT scan may delay
diagnosis of meningitis and initiation of antimicrobials, and it does
not always rule out increased ICP. Therefore head CT scans before
LP are not routinely recommended unless the patient has clinical
signs or is at risk for elevated ICP, including papilledema, focal neurologic findings, coma, history of hydrocephalus, or prior neurosurgical procedures including shunt placement. However, if a CT scan is to
be obtained before LP, antimicrobial therapy should not be delayed.
LP can safely be performed after increased ICP (if present) has been
appropriately treated.
Blood cultures should be performed in all patients with suspected
meningitis. Blood cultures reveal the responsible bacteria in up to
80–90% of cases of meningitis. Elevations of C-­reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and procalcitonin can be seen in both bacterial and viral meningitis, but some clinical prediction tools include
these tests to determine risk for bacterial meningitis.

Lumbar Puncture
See also Chapter 630.

The CSF leukocyte count in bacterial meningitis often is elevated
to >1,000/mm3 and, typically, there is a neutrophilic predominance
(75–95%). Turbid CSF is observed when the leukocyte count exceeds
200-­400/mm3. Healthy neonates may have as many as 20 leukocytes/
mm3, but older children without viral or bacterial meningitis have <8
leukocytes/mm3 in the CSF, and these should be nearly all lymphocytes
or monocytes.
The CSF leukocyte count is <250/mm3 in as many as 20% of patients
with acute bacterial meningitis. Pleocytosis may be absent in patients
with severe overwhelming sepsis associated with meningitis; this is a
poor prognostic sign. Of note, neutrophilic pleocytosis may be present
in the early stages of acute viral meningitis. The shift to lymphocytic-­
monocytic predominance in viral meningitis invariably occurs within
8-­24 hours of an initial LP. In the absence of CNS infection or inflammatory disease, children with seizures (including febrile seizures) do
not exhibit CSF pleocytosis.
A diagnostic conundrum in the evaluation of children with suspected
bacterial meningitis is the analysis of CSF obtained from children who
have already received antibiotic therapy. This is a common clinical scenario, as 25–50% of children undergoing evaluation for bacterial meningitis have received antibiotics before a CSF sample is obtained. CSF
from children with bacterial meningitis can be negative on Gram stain
and culture as early as 2-­4 hours after administration of antibiotics,
especially in situations of N. meningitidis and sensitive S. pneumoniae
meningitis. However, pleocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils,
an elevated protein level, and a reduced concentration of CSF glucose
will usually persist for several days after initiation of appropriate parenteral antibiotics. Therefore despite negative cultures, the presumptive
diagnosis of bacterial meningitis can be made on the basis of an abnormal CSF cell count, protein, and glucose. A multiplex PCR test for common CNS bacterial and viral pathogens is available for testing on CSF
samples, with turnaround times of only a few hours. This test is often
used as an adjunct (and rapid) diagnostic test, as its current sensitivity
and specificity have not supplanted the use of routine bacterial cultures;
in particular, its highest false-­positive rate is for S. pneumoniae. PCR
of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA sequences may be useful in diagnosing the cause of culture-­negative meningitis caused by prior antibiotic
therapy or for the detection of nonculturable or fastidious pathogens.
A traumatic LP may also complicate the interpretation of CSF tests,
as CSF leukocyte count and protein concentration are significantly
affected by blood in the sample. However, the Gram stain, culture, and
glucose level are unlikely to be influenced by blood in a CSF sample.
Repeat LP at a higher interspace may produce fluid that is less hemorrhagic, but this fluid usually still contains red blood cells. Although
methods for correcting for the presence of red blood cells have been
proposed for red blood cell counts <10,000 cells/mm3, these corrections can be imprecise and unreliable, so empiric treatment with antibiotics pending any bacterial culture result might be indicated.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

Most bacterial meningitis is caused by S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis, whereas H. influenzae type b is relatively rare in nations with
high immunization rates. However, other pathogens less frequently
identified in meningitis can cause similar clinical manifestations. These
organisms include other bacteria, including non–type-­b H. influenzae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Nocardia spp., Treponema pallidum
(syphilis), and Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease); fungi, such as those
endemic to specific geographic areas (Coccidioides, Histoplasma, and
Blastomyces) and those responsible for infections in compromised
hosts (Candida, Cryptococcus, and Aspergillus); parasites, such as Toxoplasma gondii and Taenia solium; and most frequently, viruses (Tables
643.2 and 643.3 and see Chapter 643.2). Focal infections of the CNS,
including brain abscess and parameningeal abscess (subdural empyema, cranial and spinal epidural abscess), may also be confused with
meningitis. In addition, noninfectious illnesses can cause generalized
inflammation of the CNS; relative to infections, these disorders are
very uncommon and include malignancy (lymphoma), immunologic
diseases (CNS vasculitis, sarcoidosis, autoimmune encephalitis), and
exposure to toxins (see Table 643.3).

ARTHROPODS
Mosquitoes
Togaviridae

Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus

Equids and small mammals are the primary reservoir. Children are at higher risk for
development of long-­term neurological sequelae.

Western equine encephalitis (WEE)
virus

Birds are the primary reservoir. Viremia is too low in humans or horses to infect
mosquitoes, so horse exposure is not a true risk factor for disease.

Flaviviridae
Dengue virus

The primary reservoir is humans and other primates. Vertical transmission has been
reported, as well through organ transplant and blood transfusion

Japanese encephalitis virus

Primary reservoir is birds and pigs. Bats may also contribute to circulation of the virus.

Murray Valley encephalitis virus

Waterfowl are the primary reservoir

St. Louis encephalitis virus

Birds are the primary reservoir

West Nile virus

Birds are the primary reservoir. Transmission has also been reported through organ
transplantation or blood transfusions.

Zika virus

Humans and non-­human primates are the like primary reservoir. Transmission has also
been reported through sexual contact and vertical transmission.

Reoviridae
Banna virus

Unknown reservoir

Bunyavirales
Jamestown Canyon virus

The primary reservoir is deer and other ungulates (moose and bison)

La Crosse encephalitis virus

Small mammals (chipmunks and squirrels) serve as the primary reservoir. Peak
incidence in school-­age children

Rift Valley fever virus

Mosquitos are the vector and reservoir. Further viral amplification occurs in livestock
and other domestic ruminants. Small mammals and bats may also contribute to
persistence. Transmission may also occur from handling infected animal tissue or
drinking unpasteurized milk.

Anaplasma phagocytophilum

White-­footed mouse is hypothesized the primary reservoir, with other sources
including various mammals including deer. Rare reports of transmission through
blood transfusion.

Borrelia burgdorferi

White-­footed mouse and other small mammals are the primary reservoir. Deer serve to
support the tick population but not Borrelia.

Ehrlichia chaffeensis

Primary reservoir is white-­tailed deer. Transmission also reported through blood
transfusion or solid organ transplantation.

Ehrlichia ewingii

Dogs and deer are hypothesized to be the primary reservoirs.

Powassan virus

Small mammals are the primary reservoir.

Rickettsia rickettsii

Transmission may occur with very short tick attachment times. Ticks serve as both the
vector and reservoir. Rare reports of transmission through blood transfusion.

Kyasanur Forest disease virus

Transmission may also occur from contact with an infected animal. While it can infect
livestock, there are no reports of transmission through unpasteurized milk

Tickborne encephalitis virus

Reservoirs include ticks, birds, and small mammals. Transmission may also occur via
direct contact, consuming unpasteurized dairy products, blood transfusion, organ
transplantation, and breastfeeding.

Bartonella bacilliformis

Reservoir is unknown. Most infections occur at sunrise or sundown as the flies are most
active during these time periods.

Mosquitos may also play a role in transmission. No other vertebrate has been
identified as a potential reservoir. Cases described from India and West Africa.

Toscana virus

Reservoir is presumed to be sandflies; very little data exist as to whether other
mammals could serve as a source of the virus.

Trypanosoma brucei gambiense

Humans are the primary reservoir although it can also be identified in primates and
ungulates. Vertical transmission has been reported.

Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense

Livestock such as cattle and other large mammals are considered to be the primary
reservoir

WILD OR DOMESTIC ANIMALS
Bats
Australian bat lyssavirus

It is assumed that any bat in Australia could carry this virus.

Histoplasma capsulatum

Guano promotes fungal growth. Bats can develop chronic and disseminated infection
with Histoplasma, but risk of transmission is likely highest through guano exposure.

Nipah virus

Reports of transmission via direct contact with bats or coming into contact with bat
bodily fluids on food. Human to human transmission has been reported.

Rabies virus

Some bat bites are too small to be detected, often post-­exposure prophylaxis is
offered to anyone with direct contact with bats or if contact cannot be ruled out (e.g.,
an individual waking up to a bat flying in the same room). Transmission has been
reported via solid organ transplant

Cattle

Brucella abortus

Many large mammals can be infected. Nearly eradicated from cattle in the US,
Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and some Asian countries including Japan
and Israel.

Dogs

Rabies virus

Many countries have been declared rabies-­free in dogs, including Europe, Japan, the
US, Australia, and New Zealand. Other countries remain at high risk for transmission
from dogs.

Toxocara canis

Dogs (especially puppies) shed eggs in feces, and organism survives in soil for
prolonged period

Bartonella henselae

Typically follows scratch or bite from cat or kitten; highest incidence in children, in the

Modified from Kliegman RM. Encephalitis. In: Kliegman RM, Toth H, Bordini BJ, et al., eds. Nelson Pediatric Symptom-­Based Diagnosis, 2nd ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier, 2023:
Table 42.3, p. 770-­775.

Determining the specific cause of CNS infection is facilitated by
careful examination of the CSF with specific stains (e.g., Kinyoun
carbol fuchsin for mycobacteria, India ink for fungi), cytology, antigen detection (Cryptococcus), CSF serology (syphilis, West Nile virus
[WNV], arboviruses), and PCR (bacteria and viruses). Other potentially valuable diagnostic tests include blood cultures, CT or MRI of
the brain, serum serologic tests, and, rarely, meningeal or brain biopsy.
Acute viral meningoencephalitis is the most likely infection to be
confused with bacterial meningitis (see Table 643.2 and Table 643.3).
Although children with viral meningoencephalitis typically appear less
ill than those with bacterial meningitis, both types of infection have
a spectrum of severity. Some children with bacterial meningitis may
have relatively mild signs and symptoms, whereas some with viral
meningoencephalitis may be critically ill. Although classic CSF profiles
associated with bacterial versus viral infection tend to be distinct (see
Table 643.1), these cases can overlap in the number of CSF leukocytes
and glucose and protein levels. Quite often, children are empirically
treated with antibiotics for >48 hours to await CSF culture and PCR
results to distinguish these two groups of pathogens.

TREATMENT

Essential to improving clinical outcomes in patients with bacterial
meningitis is prompt recognition, diagnostic testing, and initiation of
appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Several studies have demonstrated
that delays in initiating antimicrobial therapy, even a few hours, are significantly associated with adverse clinical outcomes and death. If focal
neurologic findings, papilledema, or increased ICP is present, antibiotics
should be given before obtaining a head CT scan (and subsequent LP),
and the increased ICP should be treated simultaneously (see Chapter
82). Some patients with meningitis will develop multisystem organ failure, shock (see Chapter 85), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (see
Chapter 86), requiring further management in an intensive care unit.

Initial Antibiotic Therapy

The initial (empiric) choice of antibiotic therapy for meningitis in immunocompetent infants and children should achieve bactericidal levels in
the CSF and have excellent activity against the typical bacterial causes
of meningitis (Table 643.4). Although there is substantial geographic
variation in the frequency of resistance of S. pneumoniae to β-­lactam
antibiotics, rates are increasing throughout the world. In the United
States, 25–50% of meningitic strains of S. pneumoniae have some level
of resistance to penicillin; relative resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration = 0.1-­1.0 μg/mL) is more common than high-­level resistance

(minimal inhibitory concentration = 2.0 μg/mL). Resistance to ceftriaxone and cefepime is globally variable, but in some studies can be as high
as 25%. Resistance to cephalosporins declined in the United States after
the introduction of PCV13 because of the reduction in disease caused by
serotype 19A, which is commonly associated with resistance. However,
current surveillance suggests rising rates of cephalosporin resistance
in non-­PCV13 serotypes. In contrast, most strains of N. meningitidis
are sensitive to penicillin and cephalosporins, although rare resistant
isolates have been reported. Approximately 30–40% of isolates of H.
influenzae type b and 10% of H. influenzae type a produce β-­lactamases
and therefore are resistant to ampicillin. These β-­lactamase–producing
strains remain sensitive to third-­and fourth-­generation cephalosporins.
The recommended empiric antibiotic regimen in suspected bacterial
meningitis beyond the neonatal period is a third-­generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone) plus vancomycin. Because of the efficacy of
third-­generation cephalosporins in the therapy of meningitis caused
by sensitive S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, and H. influenzae type b,
ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg/dose given every 12 hours) should be part of initial therapy. Based on the current incidence of cephalosporin-­resistant
strains of S. pneumoniae, vancomycin is also recommended as part
of empiric therapy. Vancomycin dosing guidelines have shifted from
trough-­based dosing to area under the curve/minimum inhibitory
concentration (AUC/MIC; see Chapter 225). Although current clinical data are limited, vancomycin dosing for meningitis should attain
a target AUC/MIC of 400-­600 mg*h/L (previous vancomycin trough
goals were 15-­20 mg/L). Patients allergic to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics can be treated with meropenem (40 mg/kg/dose every 8
hours); other alternatives include fluoroquinolones or chloramphenicol, if available. Alternatively, allergic patients can be desensitized to
the preferred antibiotic (see Chapter 193).
If L. monocytogenes infection is suspected, as in young infants or
those with a T-­
lymphocyte deficiency, ampicillin (300 mg/kg/day,
divided every 6 hours) also should be given because cephalosporins
are inactive against L. monocytogenes. Intravenous trimethoprim-­
sulfamethoxazole is an alternative treatment for L. monocytogenes and
has documented clinical efficacy.
If a patient is immunocompromised and gram-­negative bacterial
meningitis is suspected, initial therapy might include cefepime or
meropenem.

Duration of Antibiotic Therapy

The duration of antibiotic therapy for meningitis had been based on
experience and expert opinion rather than randomized clinical trials.

Adapted from Tunkel AR, Hartman BJ, Kaplan SL, et al. Practice guidelines for the management of bacterial meningitis. Clin Infect Dis. 2004;39:1267–1284. Table 6; with updated data
from Kimberlin DW, Barnett ED, Lynfield R, et al. Red Book (2021): Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases, 32nd ed. Itasca, IL: American Academy of Pediatrics; 2021.

In the past, the standard of care for the treatment of meningitis included
repeating an LP before the end of antimicrobial therapy. The total length
of therapy would be determined according to whether the CSF parameters (white blood cell count, protein, and glucose) had normalized or
not. However, further studies showed that abnormal CSF parameters
did not predict which patients would develop relapsed infection after
stopping antibiotics. Therefore repeat LP before discontinuation of
antibiotics for typical bacterial meningitis is not recommended.
Currently, the recommended treatment duration for uncomplicated S. pneumoniae meningitis is 10-­14 days with a third-­generation
cephalosporin, or intravenous penicillin (300,000-­400,000 units/kg/
day, divided every 4 hours) for penicillin-­sensitive isolates, or vancomycin if the isolate is resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins.
For N. meningitidis meningitis, the recommended treatment duration is 5-­7 days with intravenous penicillin for strains with an MIC of
penicillin <0.1 μg/mL, or ceftriaxone for strains with an MIC of 0.1-­1
μg/mL. Uncomplicated H. influenzae type b meningitis should be
treated for 7-­10 days with ampicillin for β-­lactamase–negative strains
or with a third-­generation cephalosporin for β-­lactamase–positive
isolates. Patients who receive intravenous or oral antibiotics before
LP and do not have an identifiable pathogen from cultures but do
have evidence of bacterial meningitis based on their CSF profile and
PCR should receive therapy with ceftriaxone for 7-­10 days. Shorter
durations of antibiotics for meningitis might be effective; one double-­
blinded, randomized study of children with meningitis demonstrated
equivalent outcomes when treating with ceftriaxone for 5 versus 10
days. In addition, during epidemics of meningococcal meningitis in
Africa, single intramuscular dosages of ceftriaxone or chloramphenicol can be used.

Meningitis caused by Escherichia coli or P. aeruginosa may require
therapy with a third-­or fourth-­generation cephalosporin or carbapenem active against the isolate in vitro. Many isolates of E. coli are sensitive to ceftriaxone, and isolates of P. aeruginosa are often sensitive to
ceftazidime. Repeat examination of CSF should be considered in some
neonates and in patients with meningitis from gram-­negative bacilli or
β-­lactam–resistant S. pneumoniae. The CSF in most cases will be sterile within 24-­48 hours of initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy.
Gram-­negative bacillary meningitis should be treated for 3 weeks, or at
least 2 weeks after CSF sterilization, if documented.
Side effects of antibiotic therapy for meningitis include phlebitis,
drug fever, rashes, emesis, oral or vaginal candidiasis, and diarrhea.
Ceftriaxone may cause reversible gallbladder pseudolithiasis, detectable by abdominal ultrasonography. This is usually asymptomatic but
may be associated with emesis and upper right quadrant pain.

Corticosteroids

Rapid killing of bacteria in the CSF by the host’s immune response and
antibiotics leads to release of inflammatory agents (e.g., endotoxin)
that precipitate a cytokine-­mediated inflammatory cascade. The resultant edema and neutrophilic infiltration may aggravate neurologic
injury with worsening of CNS signs and symptoms. Therefore agents
that restrain production of inflammatory mediators could be of benefit
in bacterial meningitis.
In a Cochrane review of corticosteroid use in meningitis, steroids
reduced hearing loss in children with meningitis caused by H. influenzae type b but not by other pathogens. The use of adjunctive steroids in
children did not reduce mortality; however, steroids did improve survival rates in adults with pneumococcal meningitis. These data support

the use of intravenous dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg/dose given every 6
hours for 2 days in the treatment of H. influenzae type b meningitis
in children over 6 weeks of age. Corticosteroids appear to have maximum benefit if given 1-­2 hours before antibiotics are initiated, which
is difficult to operationalize; steroids may also be effective if given concurrently with or soon after the first dose of antibiotics. Pediatric data
regarding benefits, if any, of corticosteroids in the treatment of meningitis caused by other bacteria remain inconclusive.

in the outpatient setting is indicated for patients who develop a hearing
deficit.

COMPLICATIONS

See also Chapter 237.
Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all close contacts of patients
with meningococcal meningitis, regardless of age or immunization status. Close contacts >1 month of age should be treated with rifampin 15-­
20 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours (maximum dose 600 mg) for 2 days as
soon as possible after identification of a case of suspected meningococcal meningitis or sepsis. Alternative options include intramuscular ceftriaxone (125 mg once for children under age 15 years, or 250 mg once
for persons older than 15 years) or ciprofloxacin 20 mg/kg as a single
oral dose (maximum 500 mg). Close contacts include household, daycare, and nursery school contacts and healthcare workers who have
direct exposure to oral secretions (mouth-­to-­mouth resuscitation, suctioning, intubation). If there is a high suspicion of meningococcemia
in the index patient, exposed contacts should be prophylaxed immediately. In addition, all contacts should be educated about the early signs
of meningococcal disease and the need to seek prompt medical attention if these signs develop.
Many countries have included quadrivalent conjugate meningococcal vaccine (types A, C, Y, and W-­135) as part of routine immunization schedules. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP) of the U.S. CDC recommends a two-­dose vaccine series for all
children, with the first dose administered at the age of 11-­12 years and
a second dose at age 16-­18 years. Vaccination is also recommended
for persons 2 months to 18 years of age who are at increased risk for
meningococcal disease, including those with anatomic or functional
asplenia or complement deficiencies or who are receiving a terminal
complement inhibitor (e.g., eculizumab). Two meningococcal vaccines
against serogroup B have been developed. In the United Kingdom, the
vaccine is administered to all infants at 2, 4, and 12 months of age.
This differs from the United States, where currently meningococcal B
vaccine is recommended for children 10 years and older at increased
risk for invasive disease and is optional for persons 16-­23 years of age.

Treatment of meningitis can be accompanied by acute CNS complications, including seizures, increased ICP, cranial nerve palsies, stroke,
cerebral or cerebellar herniation, SIADH, and thrombosis of dural
venous sinuses.
Collections of fluid in the subdural space develop in 10–30% of
patients with meningitis and are asymptomatic in 85–90% of patients.
Subdural effusions are especially common in infants. Symptomatic
subdural effusions may result in a bulging fontanel, diastasis of sutures,
enlarging head circumference, emesis, seizures, fever, or abnormal
results of cranial transillumination. CT or MRI scanning can confirm
the presence of subdural effusion. In the presence of increased ICP
or depressed level of consciousness, symptomatic subdural effusion
should be treated by aspiration through the open fontanel (see Chapters 82 and 630). Fever alone is not an indication for aspiration.
SIADH occurs in some patients with meningitis, resulting in hyponatremia and reduced serum osmolality. This may exacerbate cerebral
edema or result in hyponatremic seizures (see Chapter 82).
Fever associated with bacterial meningitis usually resolves within
5-­7 days of the onset of therapy. Prolonged fever (>10 days) is noted
in approximately 10% of patients. Prolonged fever is usually related
to intercurrent viral infection, nosocomial or secondary bacterial
infection, thrombophlebitis, or drug reaction. In meningitis caused
by N. meningitidis, pericarditis or arthritis may occur during treatment (sometimes accompanied by recrudescent fever) and is caused
by either bacterial dissemination or immune complex deposition. In
general, infectious pericarditis or arthritis occurs earlier in the course
of treatment than immune-­mediated disease.
Thrombocytosis, eosinophilia, and anemia may develop during
therapy for meningitis. Anemia may be a result of hemolysis or bone
marrow suppression. Disseminated intravascular coagulation is most
often associated with the rapidly progressive pattern of presentation
and is observed most commonly in patients with shock and purpura.
The combination of endotoxemia and severe hypotension initiates the
coagulation cascade; coexistence of ongoing thrombosis may produce
symmetric peripheral gangrene.

PROGNOSIS

Appropriate antibiotic therapy and supportive care have reduced the
mortality rate of bacterial meningitis beyond the neonatal period to
under 10%. The highest mortality rates are observed with pneumococcal meningitis. Severe neurodevelopmental sequelae may occur in
10–20% of patients recovering from bacterial meningitis, and as many
as 50% have some neurologic sequelae. The prognosis is poorer among
infants under 6 months of age and in those with high CSF bacterial
burden. Those with seizures occurring later than 4 days into therapy
or with coma or focal neurologic signs on presentation also have
increased risk of long-­term sequelae. There does not appear to be a
correlation between the duration of symptoms before a diagnosis of
meningitis and the subsequent outcome.
The most common neurologic sequelae of meningitis include hearing loss, cognitive impairment, recurrent seizures, delay in acquisition
of language, visual impairment, and behavioral problems. Sensorineural hearing loss is most frequently detected and is often already present
at the time of initial presentation. It results from cochlear or auditory
nerve inflammation and occurs in as many as 30% of patients with
pneumococcal meningitis, 10% with meningococcal meningitis, and
5–20% of those with H. influenzae type b meningitis. All patients with
bacterial meningitis should undergo careful audiologic assessment
before or soon after discharge from the hospital. Frequent reassessment

PREVENTION

Vaccination and antibiotic prophylaxis of susceptible at-­risk contacts
represent two opportunities to reduce the transmission and development of secondary cases of bacterial meningitis.

Neisseria meningitidis

Haemophilus influenzae Type b

See also Chapter 240.
Rifampin prophylaxis should be given to all household contacts of
patients with invasive disease caused by H. influenzae type b if any close
family member younger than 48 months has not been fully immunized
or if an immunocompromised child of any age resides in the household. A household contact is one who lives in the residence of the index
case or who has spent a minimum of 4 hours with the index case for
at least 5 of the 7 days preceding the patient’s hospitalization. Family
members should receive rifampin prophylaxis immediately after the
diagnosis is suspected in the index case, because over 50% of secondary cases occur in the first week after the index patient is hospitalized.
The dose of rifampin is 20 mg/kg/day (maximum dose 600 mg) given
once daily for 4 days.
Three conjugate monovalent vaccines for H. influenzae type b are
licensed in the United States along with two other multivalent vaccines
that include H. influenzae type b components. Although each vaccine
elicits different profiles of antibody response in infants immunized at
2-­6 months of age, all result in protective levels of antibody with a 93%
efficacy rate against invasive infections after the primary series. Thus
all children should be immunized with H. influenzae type b conjugate
vaccine beginning at 2 months of age. Efficacy is not as consistent in
Indigenous Nation populations, a group recognized as having a higher
incidence of H. influenzae disease.

months of age. Children who are at high risk for invasive pneumococcal infection, including those with functional or anatomic asplenia
(including sickle cell disease), cochlear implants, CSF leaks, chronic
illnesses (chronic heart disease, chronic lung disease, or diabetes mellitus), and underlying immunodeficiency (such as infection with HIV,

643.2 Viral Meningoencephalitis
Andrew B. Janowski and David A. Hunstad
Viral meningoencephalitis is an acute inflammatory process involving
the meninges and/or brain parenchymal tissue. These infections are
caused by a number of different pathogens, and quite often, no pathogen can be identified from the CSF or brain tissue specimens after routine clinical testing. The CSF is characterized by pleocytosis and the
absence of microorganisms on Gram stain and routine bacterial culture. Outcomes are quite variable because cases of meningoencephalitis caused by some pathogens are self-­limited, whereas others cause
significant long-­term neurologic sequelae.

ETIOLOGY

Among the most common causes of viral meningoencephalitis are
viruses of the family Picornaviridae, including the enteroviruses
(poliovirus, coxsackievirus, enterovirus, and echovirus) and parechoviruses (see Chapters 296 and 297) (see Tables 643.2 and 643.3).
Meningoencephalitis caused by these viruses is often self-­limited but
can be severe in neonates or chronic in immunocompromised hosts
(particularly X-­linked agammaglobulinemia; see Chapter 166). Human
coxsackievirus A7 and enteroviruses D68 and 71 have been associated
with neurologic symptoms, including acute flaccid paralysis. Parechoviruses are an important cause of meningoencephalitis in infants and
rarely cause disease in older children. Clinical manifestations in infants
are generally similar to those of enteroviral infection, but infants with
parechovirus infection may also exhibit abdominal signs or a sepsis-­
like syndrome. In addition, parechovirus infection is associated with
more severe MRI lesions of the cerebral cortex, and CSF pleocytosis
may be minimal or absent.
The term arbovirus refers to a broad range of viruses from multiple
viral families that are transmitted by arthropod vectors, typically mosquitoes or ticks (see Chapters 314 and 315). Most of these viral infections are considered zoonotic, as their primary reservoir is in birds or
small animals. Humans often represent dead-­end hosts because sufficient viremia does not develop to enable transmission back to arthropod vectors. However, humans are the primary reservoir for viruses
such as Zika, chikungunya, and dengue. The arboviruses that most
often cause meningoencephalitis include WNV, Japanese encephalitis
virus, and La Crosse virus; other arboviruses are described in Table
643.3. WNV made its appearance in the Western Hemisphere in 1999
and is now the most common arbovirus causing meningoencephalitis
in the United States. WNV may also be transmitted by blood transfusion, organ transplantation, or vertically across the placenta. Most children with WNV are either asymptomatic or have nonspecific viral-­like
illness. Approximately 1% of infected humans develop CNS disease;
adults are more severely affected than children.
Several members of the viral family Herpesviridae can cause meningoencephalitis (see Chapters 299-­304). Herpes simplex virus (HSV)
type 1 is an important cause of severe, sporadic encephalitis in children and adults, with progression to coma and death in 70% of cases
without antiviral therapy. In neonates, severe encephalitis with diffuse

brain involvement can be caused by HSV type 2, transmitted vertically
at delivery. A mild transient (and sometimes recurrent) form of meningoencephalitis with HSV-­2 may accompany genital herpes infection in
sexually active adolescents and adults. Varicella-­zoster virus (VZV)
may cause CNS infection in a close temporal relationship with clinical manifestations of chickenpox. The most common manifestation of
CNS involvement by VZV is cerebellar ataxia, whereas the most severe
form is acute encephalitis. After primary infection, VZV establishes
latency in spinal and cranial nerve roots and ganglia, and reactivation
is evidenced by herpes zoster that can be accompanied by mild meningoencephalitis. Epstein-­Barr virus is associated with various CNS syndromes (see Chapter 301). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection of the
CNS can occur with congenital infection or disseminated disease in
immunocompromised hosts, but it is an exceptionally rare cause of
meningoencephalitis in immunocompetent infants and children (see
Chapter 302). Human herpesvirus 6 is associated with encephalitis, but
detection of the virus can also be reflective of latency in lymphocytes
with reactivation caused by inflammation (see Chapter 303).
Mumps can cause meningoencephalitis and has a higher incidence
in regions where the mumps vaccine is not implemented (see Chapter
295). Mumps meningoencephalitis is typically mild, but deafness from
damage of the eighth cranial nerve can occur. Meningoencephalitis
is also associated with acute infection with measles, rubella, respiratory viruses (adenovirus, coronaviruses, influenza virus, parainfluenza
virus, respiratory syncytial virus), rotavirus, astroviruses, lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus, or rabies. HIV is associated with acute meningoencephalitis and can cause chronic encephalopathy leading to neurocognitive decline (see Chapter 322). In exceptionally rare situations,
meningoencephalitis may follow live virus vaccination against polio,
measles, mumps, rubella, or varicella.

EPIDEMIOLOGY

Meningoencephalitis has a seasonal pattern, with a peak incidence in
the summer and late fall caused by a spike in circulation of enteroviruses and arboviruses. In 2018, the most common identifiable arbovirus responsible for meningoencephalitis in the United States was WNV,
with a total of 2,647 cases; fewer than 200 combined cases were caused
by the La Crosse, Jamestown Canyon, Powassan, St. Louis, and eastern equine encephalitis viruses (see Chapter 314). In 2019, an outbreak
of 39 cases of eastern equine encephalitis occurred across the eastern
United States, and 15 cases of St. Louis encephalitis were present in the
western and central United States. In Asia, the most common cause is
Japanese encephalitis virus, with an estimated >60,000 cases per year.
Epidemiologic considerations in aseptic meningitis caused by agents
other than enteroviruses also include the season, location of residence,
recent travel, animal exposures, mosquito or tick bites, and additional
factors related to specific pathogens.
Several studies have attempted to describe the causative pathogens
associated with meningoencephalitis, including the California Encephalitis Project. Despite extensive testing, however, no pathogen can be
identified in up to 63% of cases. Newer assays such as next-­generation
sequencing have the potential to identify novel or previously unrecognized pathogens in causing meningoencephalitis. Occult meningoencephalitis cases caused by pathogens such as Leptospira, astroviruses,
and Cutibacterium (formerly Propionibacterium) acnes have been
identified through this methodology. In addition to infectious agents,
autoimmune encephalitis is a common cause of encephalitis-­like illness (see Chapter 638.4).

PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY

Neurologic damage is caused by direct invasion and destruction of
neural cells and tissues by actively multiplying viruses and by the host
reaction to viral antigens. Tissue sections of the brain generally are
characterized by meningeal congestion and mononuclear infiltration,
perivascular cuffs of lymphocytes and plasma cells, some perivascular tissue necrosis with myelin breakdown, and neuronal disruption
in various stages, including, ultimately, neuronophagia and endothelial proliferation or necrosis. A marked degree of demyelination with
preservation of neurons and their axons is considered to represent

Chapter 643 u Central Nervous System Infections
predominantly “postinfectious” or autoimmune encephalitis. In HSV
encephalitis, the cerebral cortex (classically the temporal lobes in
HSV-­1 infection) is often severely affected. Arboviruses tend to affect
the entire brain, whereas rabies has a predilection for the basal structures. The involvement of the spinal cord, nerve roots, and peripheral
nerves can be variable with these viruses.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

The progression and severity of disease are related to the relative degree
of meningeal and parenchymal involvement, which, in part, is determined by the specific etiology. The clinical course of infection varies
from case to case, even with the same causative pathogen. Some children may have mild symptoms at onset, only to lapse into a coma and
rapidly die. In others, the illness may be ushered in by high fever, violent convulsions interspersed with bizarre movements, and hallucinations, followed by complete recovery.
The onset of meningoencephalitis is generally acute, although CNS
signs and symptoms are often preceded by a nonspecific febrile illness
of a few days’ duration. The presenting manifestations in older children
include headache and hyperesthesia and, in infants, irritability and
lethargy. Headache is most often frontal or generalized; adolescents
frequently complain of retrobulbar pain. Fever, nausea and vomiting,
photophobia, and pain in the neck, back, and legs are common. With
high fevers, patients may develop altered mental status that progresses
to encephalopathy in combination with uncontrolled body movements
and seizures. Focal neurologic signs may be persistent, fluctuating, or
migratory. WNV and nonpolio enteroviruses, including enterovirus
D68, may cause anterior horn cell injury and acute flaccid paralysis.
Encephalitis is more common than aseptic meningitis in WNV infection, whereas acute flaccid paralysis may be noted in approximately
5% of patients. Loss of bowel and bladder control and unprovoked
emotional outbursts may also occur. Nonetheless, many patients have
a nonspecific febrile illness caused by WNV infection and may never
seek medical attention. Specific conditions associated with CNS viral
infection include Guillain-­Barré syndrome, transverse myelitis, hemiplegia, and cerebellar ataxia.
Exanthems can precede or accompany CNS signs, especially with
enteroviruses, VZV, measles, rubella, and WNV.
During the pandemic caused by SARS-­CoV-­2, neurologic diseases
were uncommonly associated with this infection in children, including
encephalitis, Guillain-­Barré syndrome, and stroke. In addition, in the
multisystem inflammatory syndrome of children (MIS-­C), encephalopathy is often observed, with some case series describing neurologic
symptoms in over 50% of patients with MIS-­C. Similar neurologic conditions have been observed in adults with SARS-­CoV-­2 infection, and
persistent symptoms and impairments can be observed months after
acute infection. It is unclear if the constellation of symptoms are the
result of direct infection of the CNS by SARS-­CoV-­2 or if the inflammatory response to viral infection also contributes to the development
of acute and chronic neurologic symptoms.
A syndrome of mild encephalopathy with a reversible splenial
lesion (of the corpus callosum) has been associated with various
pathogens, including rotavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), salmonella, CMV, adenovirus, and influenza virus.

DIAGNOSIS

CSF findings in viral meningoencephalitis are characterized by a pleocytosis of leukocytes with counts typically <1,000/mm3 (see Table
643.1). In the initial hours of disease, the cells may be polymorphonuclear, whereas mononuclear cells predominate for the remainder of
the illness. CSF protein concentration tends to be elevated, especially
if brain destruction is extensive, as with HSV encephalitis. The glucose
level is typically normal, although hypoglycorrhachia can occur with
certain viruses (e.g., mumps). With parechoviruses, the CSF glucose,
protein, and cell counts may be normal.
Identification of an infectious cause relies on analysis of the CSF for
the presence of pathogens by PCR and serology and, in rare situations,
identification of pathogens in brain biopsy material. CSF metagenomic
sequencing is available in limited centers. A commercial multiplex

3773

PCR assay combines testing for common bacterial and viral pathogens
in CNS infections. However, this assay does exhibit false-­positive and
false-­negative results, so many clinicians still order individual PCR
tests for common viral pathogens. In WNV meningoencephalitis, by
the time patients present for medical care, viral nucleic acid may be
absent in the CSF. Therefore the test of choice for detection of WNV
and other arboviruses is serologic (on both blood and CSF). If initial
CSF PCRs and serology are not diagnostic, serologic testing should
be repeated 2-­3 weeks later. A fourfold increase in titers for a specific
virus or other pathogen would suggest the etiology of the patient’s
presentation.
Viruses detected in blood, nasopharyngeal, stool, and urine specimens can be used to suggest a potential viral etiology. However, caution must be practiced when viruses are detected in locations outside
the CSF, because detection of these viruses may be incidental and not
explain the patient’s CNS symptoms. Other tests of potential value
in the evaluation of patients with suspected viral meningoencephalitis include an electroencephalogram (EEG) and MRI. EEG typically
shows diffuse slow-­wave activity, although focal changes in temporal
regions can be observed in HSV meningoencephalitis. MRI of the
brain may demonstrate focal brain lesions that correlate with clinical disease, including temporal lobe involvement to suggest HSV-­1
disease. Hyperdense lesions may also be identified on T2 and FLAIR
imaging (Fig. 643.1).
A diagnostic approach is noted in Table 643.5.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

Meningoencephalitis is not exclusively caused by viruses, as other
pathogens are also associated with this condition (see Table 643.3). The
most important diagnosis to differentiate from meningoencephalitis is
bacterial meningitis, given the consequences if that disease is untreated.
Most children with acute bacterial meningitis are more critically ill than
those with CNS viral infection (with HSV as an exception). Parameningeal bacterial infections, such as brain abscess or subdural or epidural
empyema, may have features similar to viral CNS infections. Infections
caused by M. tuberculosis (see Chapter 261), T. pallidum (syphilis, see
Chapter 264), and B. burgdorferi (Lyme disease, see Chapter 268) may
exhibit more indolent clinical courses. Bartonella henselae is associated
with cat exposure, a papule at the site of inoculation, regional lymphadenopathy, and new-­onset seizures (see Chapter 255). Mycoplasma
pneumoniae has been suggested as a causative pathogen in meningoencephalitis, either as a direct pathogen or a trigger of postinfectious
symptoms (see Chapter 269). However, serologic testing for Mycoplasma can be nonspecific, and IgM titers can be elevated for several
months after infection, leading to incorrect interpretation of a positive
result.
Infections caused by fungi, rickettsiae, protozoa, and other parasites
may also need to be included in the differential diagnosis. Consideration of these agents usually arises as a result of exposure history,
accompanying symptoms, local geographic epidemiology, and host
immune factors.
Nonetheless, a significant proportion of patients will have a presentation and clinical testing that is consistent with a diagnosis of
encephalitis, but despite exhaustive testing for pathogens, including
metagenomic sequencing, no etiology will be identified. In this situation, many clinicians would agree that an infectious cause is less likely
but still cannot be fully ruled out. Various noninfectious disorders
may be associated with CNS inflammation and have manifestations
overlapping with those associated with viral meningoencephalitis.
Some of these disorders include malignancy, autoimmune diseases,
intracranial hemorrhage, and exposure to certain drugs or toxins.
Attention to the history and other organ involvement usually allows
elimination of these diagnostic possibilities. Autoimmune encephalitis
caused by anti–N-­methyl-­d-­aspartate (anti-­NMDA) receptor antibodies is an important cause of noninfectious encephalitis in adolescents
and young adults (see Chapter 638.4). Detection of these antibodies
in the serum and CSF confirms this diagnosis. Anti-­NMDA receptor
encephalitis has also been associated with recent HSV encephalitis, but
a mechanism explaining this posited association is unknown. Acute

disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) may also initially be confused with encephalitis (see Chapter 640).

pathogens are identified and a postinfectious or autoimmune etiology
is suspected, patients are in some cases treated with a combination of
steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasmapheresis (see Chapters 638 and 640).

TREATMENT

For most causes of viral meningoencephalitis, no effective antiviral
agents exist; therefore treatment is primarily supportive care. Intravenous fluids are typically administered because of poor oral intake.
NSAIDs are often used for symptomatic relief of headache. It is important to monitor patients with severe encephalitis closely for seizures,
cerebral edema, disturbed fluid and electrolyte balance, aspiration,
respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
Members of the herpesvirus family can be treated with antivirals,
with acyclovir, ganciclovir, cidofovir, and foscarnet having variable
activities against these viruses (see Chapters 299-­304). Parenteral acyclovir has been specifically shown to dramatically reduce morbidity
and mortality rates in HSV-­associated meningoencephalitis. When no

PROGNOSIS

Supportive and rehabilitative efforts are very important after patients
recover from the acute phase of illness. Motor incoordination, seizures,
total or partial deafness, and behavioral disturbances may follow viral
meningoencephalitis. Visual disturbances from chorioretinopathy and
perceptual amblyopia may also occur. Some sequelae of infection may
be subtle; therefore neurologic, developmental, and audiologic evaluations should be part of the routine follow-­up of children who have
recovered from viral meningoencephalitis.
Recovery from viral infections of the CNS depends on the severity of the clinical illness, the specific causative agent, and the age of

the child. If the clinical illness is severe and substantial parenchymal
involvement is evident, the prognosis is poor, with potential deficits
being intellectual, motor, psychiatric, epileptic, visual, or auditory in
nature. Severe sequelae should also be anticipated in those with infection caused by HSV if it was not diagnosed and treated early in the disease. Overall, several studies have found that most children will have
persistent symptoms years after the diagnosis of meningoencephalitis.
These poor outcomes are likely reflective of a combination of suboptimal diagnostics for identifying pathogens that cause meningoencephalitis and a lack of specific therapies for most viral pathogens.

PREVENTION

For some viruses that cause meningoencephalitis, vaccines are available for prevention. Widespread use of effective viral vaccines for polio,
measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella has almost eliminated CNS
complications from these diseases in the United States. Vaccination
against Japanese encephalitis virus is also available, but because of high
costs, this vaccine has not been widely distributed in Asia. The availability of domestic animal vaccine programs against rabies has reduced
the frequency of rabies encephalitis.
Control of encephalitis caused by arboviruses has been less successful
because specific vaccines are only in various stages of development for
clinical trials. The primary method for reducing arbovirus infections
is vector control, through methods that include insecticides and eradicating insect breeding sites. Furthermore, minimizing mosquito and
tick bites through the application of N,N-­diethyl-­3-­methylbenzamide
(DEET)–containing insect repellents on exposed skin and wearing
long-­sleeved shirts, long pants, and socks when outdoors, especially at
dawn and dusk, reduces risk for arboviral infection.

643.3 Eosinophilic Meningitis
Andrew B. Janowski and David A. Hunstad
Eosinophilic meningitis is defined as >10 eosinophils/mm3 of CSF or a
finding that at least 10% of leukocytes in the CSF are eosinophils. The
most common cause worldwide of eosinophilic CSF pleocytosis is CNS

infection with helminthic parasites. Nonetheless, the differential diagnosis
of CSF eosinophilic pleocytosis is broad, especially in countries where helminthic infestation is uncommon, such as the United States (Table 643.6).

ETIOLOGY

Although any tissue-­migrating helminth may cause eosinophilic meningitis, the most common worldwide cause is human infection with the
rat lungworm, Angiostrongylus cantonensis (see Chapter 343). Other
parasites that can cause eosinophilic meningitis include Gnathostoma
spinigerum (dog and cat roundworm; see Chapter 343), Baylisascaris
procyonis (raccoon roundworm), Ascaris lumbricoides (human roundworm, see Chapter 337), Toxocara canis (see Chapter 344), Trichinella
spiralis (see Chapter 345), Toxoplasma gondii (see Chapter 336), Paragonimus westermani, Paragonimus kellicotti, Echinococcus granulosus
(see Chapter 350), Schistosoma japonicum (see Chapter 346), Onchocerca volvulus, and Taenia solium (see Chapter 349). Eosinophilic meningitis may also occur as an unusual manifestation of more common
viral, bacterial, or fungal infections of the CNS; for example, coccidioidomycosis has been particularly associated with eosinophilic meningitis. Noninfectious causes of eosinophilic meningitis include multiple
sclerosis, malignancy, hypereosinophilic syndrome, or a reaction to
medications or ventriculoperitoneal shunt materials.

EPIDEMIOLOGY

A. cantonensis is found in Southeast Asia, the South Pacific, Japan, Taiwan,
Egypt, the Ivory Coast, and Cuba. Infection is acquired by eating raw or
undercooked freshwater snails, slugs, prawns, or crabs containing infectious third-­stage larvae. Gnathostoma infections are found in Japan, China,
India, Bangladesh, and Southeast Asia. Gnathostomiasis is acquired by
eating undercooked or raw fish, frog, bird, or snake meat. B. procyonis is
endemic in the United States and is acquired by children playing outdoors
where raccoons may deposit the organisms (raccoon latrines).

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Patients with eosinophilic meningitis from helminthic infestation typically become ill 1-­3 weeks after exposure, as this reflects the transit
time for parasites to migrate from the gastrointestinal tract to the CNS.
Concomitant findings include fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, creeping skin eruptions, pleurisy, or peripheral eosinophilia. Neurologic
symptoms may include headache, meningismus, ataxia, cranial nerve

palsies, and paresthesias. Paraparesis or incontinence can result from
radiculitis or myelitis.

DIAGNOSIS

The presumptive diagnosis of helminth-­induced eosinophilic meningitis is most often based on travel and exposure history in the presence of typical clinical and laboratory findings. Direct visualization of
helminths in CSF is difficult because there typically is a low burden of
organisms. Serologic assays for helminthic infections are also of limited
utility because they are not readily available commercially and there is
substantial cross-reactivity among different helminth species.

TREATMENT

Treatment is supportive, but anthelmintic drugs with or without
steroids may be indicated (see Table 643.6). Anthelmintic drugs may
provoke an inflammatory response because dying organisms can exacerbate symptoms. However, treatment of B. procyonis should be initiated with albendazole and corticosteroids. Steroids may decrease
the duration of headaches in adults with eosinophilic meningitis.
Analgesics should be given for headache and radiculitis, and CSF
removal or shunting should be performed to relieve hydrocephalus,
if present.

PROGNOSIS

Overall, up to 70% of patients improve significantly within 4 weeks
after the onset of symptoms. The mortality rate associated with eosinophilic meningitis is <5%; untreated Baylisascaris infection may be fatal
or associated with severe sequelae.

Brain Abscess
Andrew B. Janowski and David A. Hunstad
Annually, approximately 0.3-­1.3 cases of brain abscess per 100,000
people are diagnosed. Development of brain abscess is most often
associated with an underlying etiology, including contiguous spread
from an associated infection (meningitis, otitis media, mastoiditis,
sinusitis, soft tissue infection of the face or scalp, orbital cellulitis,
or dental infections); direct compromise of the blood-­brain barrier
due to penetrating head injuries or surgical procedures; embolic
phenomena (endocarditis); right-­to-­left shunts (congenital heart
disease or pulmonary arteriovenous malformation); immunodeficiency; or infection of foreign material inserted into the central nervous system (CNS), including ventriculoperitoneal shunts
(Table 644.1).

PATHOLOGY

Cerebral abscesses occur in both hemispheres in children, but in
adults, left-­sided abscesses are more common, likely because of penetrating injuries from right-­handed assailants. Nearly 80% of abscesses
occur in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, whereas abscesses in
the occipital lobe, cerebellum, and brainstem account for the remainder of cases. In 18% of cases, multiple brain abscesses are present,
and in nearly 20% of cases, no predisposing risk factor can be identified. Abscesses in the frontal lobe are often caused by extension from
sinusitis or orbital cellulitis, whereas abscesses located in the temporal lobe or cerebellum are frequently associated with otitis media and
mastoiditis.

Blaser MJ, eds. Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett’s Principles and Practice of Infectious
Diseases, 9th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier; 2020: Table 90.1, p. 1249.

ETIOLOGY

The predominant organisms that cause brain abscesses are streptococci, which account for one third of all cases in children, with
members of the Streptococcus anginosus group (S. anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus intermedius) being the
most common streptococci. Other important streptococci include
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus spp., and other viridans
streptococci. Staphylococcus aureus is the second most common
organism in pediatric brain abscesses, accounting for 11% of cases,
and is most often associated with penetrating injuries. Other bacteria isolated from brain abscesses include gram-­negative bacilli
(Haemophilus spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus
spp., and other Enterobacterales) and anaerobic bacteria (gram-­
positive organisms, Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium spp., Prevotella
spp., and Actinomyces spp.). In neonates with meningitis, abscess

3780 Part XXV u The Nervous System
formation is a complication in 13% of cases, with Citrobacter koseri,
Cronobacter sakazakii, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis
being special considerations in this age group. In up to 27% of all
cases, more than one organism is isolated on routine bacterial cultures. Metagenomics sequencing has revealed that this percentage
is likely a significant underestimate, as DNA from additional uncultured species has been detected from purulent abscess fluid, including rare case reports of detection of archaea. Abscesses associated
with mucosal infections (sinusitis or dental infections) are more
frequently polymicrobial and include anaerobic pathogens. Atypical bacteria, including Nocardia, Mycobacterium, and Listeria spp.,
and fungi (Aspergillus, Candida, Cryptococcus) are more common
in children with impaired host defenses.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Often the early stages of cerebritis and abscess formation are asymptomatic or are associated with nonspecific symptoms, including low-­
grade fever, headache, and lethargy. As the inflammatory process
proceeds, vomiting, severe headache, seizures, papilledema, focal
neurologic signs (hemiparesis), and coma may develop. The classic triad of headache, fever, and a focal deficit is noted in <50% of
patients. A cerebellar abscess is characterized by nystagmus, ipsilateral ataxia and dysmetria, vomiting, and headache. If an abscess
ruptures into the ventricular cavity, overwhelming shock and death
may occur.

and brain abscess caused by MRSA. A, T1 fl2D postcontrast axial image
demonstrating enhancement of the rim of the abscess. B, T2 TSE axial
image showing a large fluid-­filled lesion with surrounding edema.

DIAGNOSIS

The key to diagnosis of brain abscesses is prompt imaging of the
CNS. Brain MRI with contrast is the diagnostic test of choice
because it can aid in differentiating abscesses from cysts and
necrotic tumors (Fig. 644.1). As an alternative, cranial CT can
provide more rapid imaging results but cannot provide the fine
parenchymal detail offered by MRI (Fig. 644.2). Both MRI and
CT scans with contrast can demonstrate a ring-­enhancing abscess
cavity. CT findings of cerebritis are characterized by a parenchymal low-­density lesion, whereas T2-­weighted MRI images feature
increased signal intensity. Other abnormalities in common laboratory tests can be observed in children with brain abscesses. The
peripheral white blood cell count is elevated in 60% of cases, and
blood cultures are positive in 28% of cases. Lumbar puncture is
not routinely recommended in cases of brain abscess, because the
procedure could cause brain herniation from elevated intracranial
pressure. When tested, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is normal in
16% of cases, 71% of cases exhibit CSF pleocytosis, and 58% will
have an elevated CSF protein level. CSF cultures are positive in only
24% of cases; therefore a culture obtained from the abscess fluid is
essential for identifying bacterial pathogens. In some cases, culture
of the abscess fluid can be sterile, and alternative testing, including
16S ribosomal RNA sequencing, may be used to identify organisms.
An electroencephalogram (EEG) may identify corresponding focal
slowing.

TREATMENT

The initial management of brain abscess includes prompt diagnosis
and initiation of an antibiotic regimen that is based on the most
likely pathogens (Table 644.2). Empiric therapy consists of a combination of a third-­generation cephalosporin and metronidazole;
often, vancomycin is added to provide coverage of methicillin-­
resistant S. aureus and resistant S. pneumoniae. Pharmacokinetics
and penetration of the blood-­brain barrier are essential considerations when using alternative agents. If resistant gram-­negative
organisms are suspected, as in cases of infected ventriculoperitoneal shunts, cefepime or meropenem may be used as the β-­lactam
in the initial regimen. Listeria monocytogenes may cause brain
abscess in the neonate, and if this etiology is suspected, penicillin
G or ampicillin with gentamicin is recommended. In immunocompromised patients, broad-­spectrum antibiotic coverage is used, and

wall-­enhancing abscess in the left frontal lobe causing a rightward parenchymal shift. The patient had no neurologic signs until just before
the CT scan, likely because the frontal lobe is a relatively “silent” area
of the brain.
amphotericin B or azole therapy should be considered for coverage
of potential fungi.
Neurosurgical procedures for brain abscess have been greatly
enhanced by stereotactic MRI or CT systems, allowing for optimized
approaches to minimize morbidity. Aspiration of the abscess is recommended for diagnostic cultures and decompression unless contraindicated based on its location or the patient’s condition. There are limited
data regarding injection of antibiotics into the abscess cavity, and this
technique is not routinely recommended. Small abscesses (under 2.5
cm in diameter) or multiple abscesses may be treated initially with
antibiotics and without surgical drainage, with follow-­up neuroimaging studies to ensure a decrease in abscess size. Surgical excision
of an abscess is rarely required, because such a procedure may be

associated with greater morbidity compared with aspiration of a
cavity. Administration of glucocorticoids can reduce edema, though
evidence for improved outcomes with steroids is lacking.
The antibiotic regimen may be narrowed or made more specific once
abscess culture data are available; importantly, most abscesses are polymicrobial, and not all organisms present may be isolated in culture.
The duration of parenteral antibiotic therapy depends on the causative
organism(s) and response to treatment (clinically and by imaging) but
is typically 6 weeks. There has been interest in shorter regimens or use
of oral antibiotics as an alternative to parenteral antibiotics, but clinical
data are currently insufficient to support these alternative approaches.

PROGNOSIS

Mortality rates with contemporary use of CT and MRI, improved
microbiologic techniques, and prompt antibiotic and surgical management are <10%. Factors associated with high mortality rate at the
time of admission include delayed administration of antimicrobials,
age <1 year, multiple abscesses, and coma. Long-­term sequelae occur
in about one third of patients and include hemiparesis, seizures,
hydrocephalus, cranial nerve abnormalities, and behavioral and
learning difficulties.

Idiopathic Intracranial
Hypertension
(Pseudotumor Cerebri)
Alasdair P.J. Parker and Pooja D. Harijan
Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), or pseudotumor cerebri,
is frequently considered a potential cause of headache with papilledema in children with normal findings on standard brain MRI. A
false-­positive diagnosis is common, and strategies are needed to avoid
this. The pathophysiology remains poorly understood, particularly in
children.
IIH is rare, affecting 1 in 100,000-­150,000 children, but accurate
diagnosis is essential because of the risk of loss of vision. Previously,
normal levels of intracranial pressure (ICP) were unclear, leading to
overdiagnosis of IIH. Studies in children with ICP monitoring show
an upper limit of normal as 10 mm Hg (13.5 cm H2O) between the
ages of 2 and 5 years, with the adult level of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
pressure being reached by 8 years of age. Currently, the 90th percentile
of CSF pressure on lumbar puncture (LP) has been reported to be 28
cm CSF (22 mm Hg) in children age 5 to 18 years, without a significant
age effect. Other normal parameters include CSF cell count, protein
content, and ventricular size (although this could be slightly decreased
on brain MRI). Papilledema may be overdiagnosed. With the advent
of orbital coherence tomography (OCT), B-­ultrasound, and MRI/
venography, identification has improved (Figs. 645.1-­645.3). Great care
should be taken before the diagnosis of IIH, as there is a high rate of
misdiagnosis (Fig. 645.4) and management is challenging.

IIH is rare under the age of 10 years. In postpubertal children, there
is a female sex preponderance, and for reasons that are poorly understood, patients are much more likely to be obese. However, most obese

impairment. OCT (see Fig. 645.3), B-­ultrasound, and autofluorescence
studies are strongly advised in all cases, as these will identify drusen
and image the swelling. Inferior nasal or peripheral visual field defects
may be detected. The presence of other focal neurologic signs prompts
investigations to uncover a process other than IIH. All children should
undergo cranial MRI, which may show any of the following: empty
sella (in postpubertal children), posterior pituitary stalk displacement,
meningoceles, posterior globe flattening, optic nerve head protrusion,
optic nerve enhancement, optic nerve sheath distension, optic nerve
tortuosity, slitlike ventricles, tight subarachnoid spaces, and inferior
position of cerebellar tonsils (Fig. 645.5 and see Fig. 645.2). Absence of
these findings does not rule out the diagnosis.
MR venography is essential, both to exclude venous thromboses/stenoses and to identify the tapering of the transverse sinuses that is commonly
seen in intracranial hypertension (see Fig. 645.5). All children require
measurement of their CSF pressure. Standard opening pressures in cm
H2O using a manometer can be falsely raised when the child is distressed
or overflexed. More accurate recording will be achieved using an electronic transducer (similar equipment routinely attaches onto an arterial
line), which will give a computer-­aided recording with waveform analysis, both on opening and in steady state for 20 minutes (when the child
is relaxed, happy, in the lateral decubitus position, and not held tightly
or in an overflexed position). Cooperation of the child is required and
is helped by the presence of a play specialist or use of nitrous oxide during needle insertion, thereby minimizing factors that may artificially alter
ICP such as pain, crying, Valsalva maneuver, or abnormal respiration.
When LP opening pressure is measured under general anesthesia,
it is important to record a normal end-­tidal partial pressure of carbon
dioxide (ET-­PCo2). Because secondary IH is more common, renal,
liver, thyroid, hematologic, inflammatory, and autoimmune profiles
should be obtained on venous blood testing. CSF infusion studies can
also be helpful, particularly in borderline cases. Sterile fluid is infused
via the spinal needle, and the resultant pressure-­volume data can be
analyzed to give the CSF dynamics and variables such as the pulse
amplitude of ICP, the compensatory reserve, and the magnitude of slow
waves of CSF pressure. Typically in IIH, the CSF pressure is elevated,
the resistance to CSF outflow is low, and there is a depleted compensatory reserve. A summary of diagnostic criteria is noted in Table 645.2.

TREATMENT

Any causes of secondary IH should be treated (e.g., withdrawal of a
drug). There are no randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to guide the
treatment of IIH. The initial diagnostic LP may be therapeutic. The spinal needle produces a small hole in the dura that allows CSF to escape
the subarachnoid space, thus reducing ICP. An additional LP and the
removal of sufficient CSF to reduce the opening pressure by 50% occasionally lead to resolution of the process. Obese children with IIH need
a weight-­loss regimen, but the success rate is low. Medical management may include acetazolamide and topiramate. Acetazolamide (10-­
30 mg/kg/24 hours) has been found effective in adult RCT studies:

some authors have recommended using topiramate, which has the
added benefits of possible migraine prophylaxis and, in obese children,
of being an appetite suppressant. Corticosteroids are not routinely
administered because there is no benefit. When the symptoms such as
headache and, in particular, visual deterioration, do not improve with
an LP and acetazolamide or topiramate, then consideration of surgical
management is necessary. In children first-­line surgical management
is currently CSF diversion (e.g., ventriculoperitoneal [VP] shunt, LP
shunt); risks include obstruction and infection. There is a potential role
for endovascular management of dural sinus stenosis (the technique of
inserting a catheter to direct a self-­expanding stent over a guide wire
across a venous sinus stenosis)—this is increasingly first-­line surgical
treatment in adults; pediatric experience is limited. Repeated LP is
likely to be traumatic for the child and unlikely to produce a longer-­
term solution. The value of optic nerve sheath fenestration (a decompressive procedure) is debated and is rarely performed; risks include
ischemia and hemorrhage.

Chapter 646 u Spinal Cord Disorders
Any child whose ICP proves to be refractory to treatment warrants
repeat full investigation. Serial monitoring of visual function (i.e.,
visual acuity, color vision, and visual fields) is required in children old
enough to participate but remains a challenge in younger children.
Serial optic nerve examination is also essential. OCT is useful to serially follow changes in papilledema. Serial visual-­evoked potentials are
useful if the visual acuity cannot be reliably documented.
Multidisciplinary management, including a pediatrician, pediatric
neurologist, ophthalmologist, orthoptist, radiologist, specialist nurses,
and, as needed, dietician, psychologist, interventional radiologist, and
neurosurgeon, is helpful both in diagnosis and ongoing management.
The majority of adults with IIH continue to have headache after normalization of ICP and hence require continued headache management.
Permanent visual function loss in IIH is rare; data from small studies
suggest reduced visual acuity in up to 10% and permanent visual field
defects in less than 17% of children.

that disrupt the pial surface of the spinal cord.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Patients at risk for the subsequent development of tethered cord syndrome can often be identified at birth by the presence of an open
myelomeningocele or by cutaneous manifestations of dysraphism (see
Chapter 631). It is important to examine the back of the newborn for
cutaneous midline lesions (lipoma, dermal sinus, tail, or hairy patch)
that may signal an underlying form of occult dysraphism. Dermal
sinuses are almost always located above the gluteal fold, and dimples
in the gluteal cleft directly overlying the coccyx are generally benign
fibrous tracts called coccygeal pits that are not associated with spinal
tethering. However, cutaneous abnormalities may be absent in patients

Spinal Cord Disorders
Katie P. Fehnel and Mark R. Proctor
646.1 Tethered Cord
Katie P. Fehnel and Mark R. Proctor
Normally, as the spine flexes and extends, the spinal cord is free to
move up and down within the spinal canal. If the spinal cord is fixed
at any point, its movement is restricted, and the spinal cord and nerve
roots can become stretched. This fixing of the spinal cord, regardless of
the underlying cause, is called a tethered cord. When pain, neurologic
deterioration, or bladder and bowel dysfunction occurs in response to
the fixation, it is called tethered cord syndrome.
By full gestational age, the spinal cord ends, on average, at the lumbar L1-­2 disk space, although there is a normal bell-­shaped distribution from thoracic T12-­L3. Spinal cord tethering cannot be determined
by position of the conus medullaris alone, but a position below L3 is
concerning for tethering, especially when associated with an abnormality that connects the cord to the bones or soft tissues around the
spine. Similarly, the spinal cord can be tethered even if it terminates in
a normal position if a tethering lesion is present. This can occur from
a variety of causes.
In its simplest form, tethered cord syndrome results from a thickened filum terminale, which normally extends as a thin, very mobile
structure from the tip of the conus to the sacrococcygeal region, where
it attaches. When this structure is thickened and/or shortened, the cord
can become tethered. This stretching between two points can cause
symptoms later in life. Fatty infiltration is often seen in the thickened
filum (Fig. 646.1).
Other conditions that are well-­established as causes of symptomatic
tethering include various forms of occult dysraphism, such as lipomyelomeningocele, myelocystocele, and diastematomyelia. These conditions can be associated with cutaneous manifestations such as midline
lipomas, asymmetry of the gluteal fold (Fig. 646.2), dimples, and hairy
patches called hypertrichosis (Fig. 646.3). Probably the most commonly
known type of symptomatic tethered cord involves patients who had
previously undergone closure of an open myelomeningocele and later
become symptomatic with pain or neurologic deterioration. Tethered
cord syndrome can also be iatrogenic and associated with scarring of

with tethered spinal cord, and these patients present later in life with
clinical manifestations.
Patients who become symptomatic later in life generally present with
one of four clinical manifestations, including neurologic, orthopedic,
bowel/bladder, and/or pain symptoms. One orthopedic presentation
is asymmetry of the feet, with a smaller, high-­arched foot with clawing of the toes (Fig. 646.4), sometimes referred to as neuroorthopedic
syndrome. Characteristically, there is no ankle jerk on the involved
side and the calf is atrophied. Scoliosis can also be a presenting sign.
Another clinical presentation is increasing urinary urgency, which may
progress to incontinence. Constipation progressing to incontinence
can affect the gastrointestinal system as well. Finally, severe generalized back pain, often radiating into the lower extremities, can occur,
particularly in older adolescents and adults.

potential need for reoperation and sometimes even multiple reoperations is high. Given the technical challenges and increased neurologic
risk in a patient multiply reoperated on for tethered cord, in adolescent
patients for whom axial growth has completed, spinal column shortening procedures have been proposed as an alternative treatment modality. As opposed to surgery at the site of tethering, the tension is released
by actual shortening of the vertebral column.

646.2 Diastematomyelia (Split-­Cord
Malformation)
Katie P. Fehnel and Mark R. Proctor

When patients present with symptoms related to tethered cord syndrome, a thorough motor and sensory examination of the patient must
be documented. Assessment of bladder function with an ultrasound
of the bladder and urodynamic studies is useful in analyzing bladder innervation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the diagnostic
study of choice for the anatomy of the tethering lesion and to provide
information about the risks of surgical intervention.

Diastematomyelia is a relatively rare form of occult dysraphism in
which the spinal cord is divided into two halves and can present as
tethered spinal cord. In type 1 split-­cord malformation, there are two
spinal cords, each in its own dural tube and separated by a spicule of
bone and cartilage (Fig. 646.5). In a type 2 split-­cord malformation,
the two spinal cords are enclosed in a single dural sac with a fibrous
septum between the two spinal segments (Fig. 646.6). In both cases, the
anatomy of the outer half of the spinal cord is essentially normal but
the medial half is extremely underdeveloped. Undeveloped nerve roots
and dentate ligaments terminate medially into the medial dural tube in
type 1 cases and terminate in the membranous septum in type 2 cases.
Both types have an associated defect in the bony spinal segment. In the
case of type 2 lesions, this defect can be quite subtle.

TREATMENT

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION

There are no nonsurgical options for the management of tethered cord
syndrome. Because the presence of asymptomatic tethering is most
likely to be at least suspected in the newborn, prophylactic surgery to
prevent late deterioration has been advocated by some neurosurgeons.
This strategy remains controversial and depends to some extent on a
careful assessment of the risks compared with the benefits. If surgical intervention is chosen, microsurgical dissection with release of the
spinal cord attachment to the overlying dura and soft tissues is the goal
of treatment.

OUTCOME

The outcome of surgery depends on the complexity of the underlying
lesion and the presenting condition of the child because existing deficits are generally not reversed. Releasing a thickened filum terminale or
detethering of patients with diastematomyelia generally yields a good
outcome, and the chance of recurrent symptoms is quite low. Patients
with symptomatic tethered cord who undergo repair of a myelomeningocele or a lipomyelomeningocele have a significant possibility
of recurrent tethering and recurrent symptoms. In this cohort, the

Patients with both type 1 and type 2 split-­cord malformations will have
presentations similar to other types of spinal tethering lesions. This may
include subtle signs of neurologic involvement, such as unilateral calf
atrophy and a high arch in one or both feet early in life, but they are
more likely to be neurologically normal. These patients are tethered by
the adherence of the spinal cord, so they may develop progressive loss
of bowel and bladder function and sensory and motor difficulties in
the lower extremities. Back pain is a common symptom in adolescents
and adults with split-­cord malformation but is uncommon in small
children.
Cutaneous manifestations of dysraphism are present in 90% of
patients with split-­cord malformations. Large, hairy, midline patches
called hypertrichosis, the most common cutaneous manifestations, are
present in approximately 60% of the cases.

DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION

MRI, the study of choice, shows the two spinal cords. The frequent
association of bony abnormalities in this condition may require further
evaluation with computed tomography (CT).

TREATMENT

The treatment of split-­cord malformation is surgical. This abnormality is
a form of tethered cord syndrome, and its treatment is to release the spinal cord to move freely with movement of the spine. In type 1 split-­cord
malformations, the two half-­cords are in separate dural sacs with medial
attachment to the dura and bony septum. In this case, the dura needs to
be opened, the bony septum removed, the medial attachments to the dura
lysed, and a single dural tube created. For type 2 lesions, the membranous
septum should be lysed. An attachment of this membrane to the anterior
dura should be explored and lysed as well. Retethering of this type is rare,
as there is no reason to disrupt the pial layer of the spinal cord.

Syringomyelia is a cystic distention of the spinal cord caused by
obstruction of the flow of spinal fluid from within the spinal cord to
its point of absorption. There are three recognized forms of syringomyelia, depending on the underlying cause. Communicating syringomyelia implies that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from within the ventricles
communicates with the fluid within the spinal cord and is assumed to
be the source of the CSF that distends the spinal cord. Noncommunicating syringomyelia implies that ventricular CSF does not communicate with the fluid within the spinal cord. It primarily occurs in the
context of intramedullary tumors and obstructive lesions. In the final
form of syringomyelia, that is, posttraumatic syringomyelia, spinal
cord injury results in damage and subsequent softening of the spinal
cord. This softening, combined with the scarring of the surrounding
spinal cord tissue, results in progressive distention of the cyst. Syringomyelia is highly associated with Chiari malformation and can also be
seen after infection or trauma, but many cases seen on imaging are normal anatomic variants unassociated with syndromes or any symptoms.
It is also associated with connective tissue disorders (Ehlers-­Danlos
syndrome).

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Signs and symptoms of syringomyelia develop insidiously over years or
decades. The classic presentation is central cord syndrome. Syringomyelia affects the spinal cord beginning from the central region, where
the cervical and thoracic nerve fibers are located, so it less commonly
affects the lumbar and sacral fibers, which are more laterally located in
the spinal cord. Therefore in syringomyelia the patient develops numbness beginning in the shoulder in a capelike distribution followed by
the development of atrophy and weakness in the upper extremities.
Trophic ulcers of the hands are characteristic of advanced cases.
Other forms of presentation include scoliosis that may be rapidly
progressive and often can be presumed from the absence of superficial
abdominal reflexes. Urgency and bladder dysfunction as well as lower
extremity spasticity also may be part of the presentation.
In patients with syringomyelia related to significant prior spinal cord
injury, the presentation is usually severe pain in the area of the spinal
cord distention above the level of the initial injury. There is also an
ascending level of motor and sensory dysfunction.

3788 Part XXV u The Nervous System
DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION

MRI is the radiologic study of choice (Figs. 646.7 and 646.8). The study
should include the entire spine, and gadolinium-­enhanced sequences
should be a part of it if there is a suspicion for tumor. Specific attention
should be paid to the craniovertebral junction because of the frequent
association of syringomyelia with Chiari malformations. Obstruction
to the flow of CSF from the fourth ventricle can cause syringomyelia;
therefore most patients also should undergo imaging of the brain if a
Chiari malformation is seen on the cervical imaging.

TREATMENT

The treatment of syringomyelia should be tailored to the underlying
cause, and rarely is the syringomyelia addressed directly. If that cause
can be removed or ameliorated, the syrinx should improve. Direct surgery on the syrinx is associated with a much higher surgical risk profile.
Communicating syringomyelia is most frequently seen in the context of abnormalities at the craniovertebral junction, often associated
with Chiari malformations (see Fig. 646.7). In such cases, decompression of the craniovertebral junction is usually effective in the management of the syringomyelia. In the context of Chiari II malformation
associated with spina bifida, syringomyelia usually results from an
insidious failure of the shunt used to treat the hydrocephalus. This distention of the spinal cord results in a rapid development of scoliosis
and occasionally spasticity in the lower extremities. Repair of the shunt
is often effective treatment, and only rarely is surgical decompression at
the craniovertebral junction necessary. Other conditions that can cause
obstruction at the craniocervical junction include inflammatory conditions such as chronic meningitis, as seen in tuberculosis or meningeal
carcinomatosis.
Noncommunicating syringomyelia results from blocking the flow
of spinal cord extracellular fluid or CSF within the central canal by
an intramedullary spinal cord tumor or severe external compression
of the spinal cord. In such cases, management should be directed to
tumor resection or to decompression of constricting elements.
Traumatic syrinxes result from hematomyelia in the substance of
the spinal cord coupled with severe arachnoidal scarring around the
circumference of the spinal cord. When progressive, this form of syringomyelia is treated by exploration and lysis of the adhesions that fix
the spinal cord to the overlying dura. Microscopic lysis of the scar surrounding the spinal cord at the point of injury allows the spinal cord to
collapse and prevents it from being distorted by a hydrostatic column
of spinal fluid pulsations.
In rare cases, direct drainage procedures must be employed and
can result in symptomatic and radiographic improvement. Syrinx-­to-­
subarachnoid or pleural shunting with a small piece of silicone tubing
is the treatment option. These procedures often have short-­lived success because the tubing tends to become obstructed, so they should be
reserved for cases with obstructive symptoms.
In the current era, where many children are undergoing spinal
MRI, some children who demonstrate no neurologic deficits are being
referred to pediatric neurosurgeons with the diagnosis of syringomyelia. Many of these children were scanned because of back pain or
as part of a screening for scoliosis. They are found on MRI to have a
persistent central canal, and the diagnosis of syringomyelia is made.
These syrinxes are 1-­3 mm in diameter and may extend over several
segments (see Fig. 646.8). There is no distortion of the spinal cord in
the region and no change in signal of the surrounding spinal cord.
These syrinxes have been called “idiopathic” syrinxes. Follow-­up of
significant numbers of such children has shown them to be benign in
nature and probably represent a normal variant. There does not seem
to be a need for routine follow-­up imaging without new symptoms.
They need no treatment and do not require limitations of activity.

646.4 Spinal Cord Tumors
Katie P. Fehnel and Mark R. Proctor
Tumors of the spine and spinal cord are rare in children. Different types
of tumors have different relationships with the spinal cord, meninges,
and bony elements of the spine (Fig. 646.9). Intramedullary spinal cord
tumors arise within the substance of the spinal cord itself (Fig. 646.10).
They represent between 5% and 15% of primary central nervous system tumors. This percentage may well reflect the relative volume of
spinal cord compared with brain. Approximately 10% of intramedullary spinal cord tumors are malignant astrocytic tumors, but most are
World Health Organization grade I or II tumors of glial or ependymal
origin. In children, low-­grade astrocytomas and gangliogliomas represent the most common tumor types, with ependymomas being less
common than in adults.
Except in the context of neurofibromatosis (NF-­1 and NF-­2; see
Chapter 636.1), intradural extramedullary tumors are extremely rare in
children. Most are nerve sheath tumors, either schwannomas or neurofibromas. Intraspinal meningiomas in children are essentially found
only in patients with NF-­2 or those who have undergone prior irradiation for some reason. The intradural extramedullary compartment is
also a site for metastatic tumors from primary cancers such as leukemia
or primitive neuroectodermal tumors. Myxopapillary ependymoma, a
benign subtype found in the filum terminale, is another extramedullary tumor seen in children.
Extradural spinal tumors characteristically begin in the bones of the
spine. Primary tumors in this location include aneurysmal bone cysts,
Langerhans cell histiocytosis (formerly called eosinophilic granuloma),
osteoid osteoma, and giant cell tumors. In infants, the extradural space
is often the site of neuroblastomas or ganglioneuroblastomas, which
tend to extend from a paraspinal location into the epidural space
through the intervertebral foramen. In older patients, the bones of the
spine may be the site of multiple myeloma and metastases from common malignant tumors, such as chordoma and sarcomas.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

With the exception of the uncommon malignant glial tumors of the
spinal cord, which tend to present precipitously, intramedullary spinal
cord tumors present in a very insidious manner. Back pain related to
the level of the tumor is a common presenting complaint. It is likely that
this pain will awaken the child from sleep and improve as the day progresses. Before the use of MRI became routine, the time from the first
onset of symptoms to diagnosis of the tumor could be very prolonged,
extending years. Weakness, gait disturbance, and sensory deficits are
usually subtle but detectable on formal neurologic examination. Scoliosis, limb asymmetry, and bowel or bladder disturbance may be the presenting complaints associated with intramedullary spinal cord tumors.
Nerve sheath tumors primarily arise from the sensory rootlet of the
exiting spinal nerve. They are very slow-­growing tumors and present
with symptoms and signs relative to the nerve root involved. Pain in
a bandlike distribution around the chest or into an extremity is the
most common presenting complaint. Tumor growth eventually leads to
spinal cord compression and involvement of adjacent nerve roots, but
pain is the more likely presenting symptom.
Extramedullary extradural tumors have a tendency to present more
acutely owing to rapid growth within a confined space. Such children
may present with acute paresis and urinary retention. They can also
present abruptly with severe pain and neurologic deficit at the time of
pathologic fracture of the vertebral body. Benign tumors such as giant
cell tumors and aneurysmal bone cysts present more insidiously as the
tumor slowly grows and begins to compress neural structures. Osteoid
osteomas present with severe pain relieved by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.

DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION

MRI with and without gadolinium enhancement of the spinal cord is
the diagnostic study of choice and is essential in the diagnosis of spinal cord tumors, especially intramedullary spinal cord tumors. Most

astrocytic tumors of the spinal cord and most ependymomas show
diffuse enhancement and will distend the spinal cord focally. These
tumors may involve the entire length of the spinal cord (holocord
astrocytomas), although much of the change might be due to the associated syrinx. Nerve sheath tumors characteristically enhance and are
focal. They may exit through the neural foramen and distend the canal,
as can be seen on MRI. They also may be visualized on plain radiographs of the affected area of the spine because of their chronic effect
on the bones.
Plain radiographs of the spine are helpful in defining the relationship
of extradural tumors to the bony spine and in documenting evidence
of instability in the case of pathologic compression fractures. When a
pathologic fracture occurs, CT is essential to determine the effect of the
tumor on the bone. Because many of these tumors occur as metastatic
lesions, a general staging of the extent of disease is essential. In the

case of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, a thorough bone survey should
be conducted to look for other lesions. Radionucleotide bone scanning, rapid STIR MRI, or PET MRI scans are useful in determining the
extent of the disease.

TREATMENT

The primary treatment of both intramedullary and extramedullary
intradural tumors is surgical removal. For both low-­grade astrocytomas and ependymomas, microsurgical removal with the intent of
total removal is the treatment of choice. This goal should be attainable in most patients with ependymomas and gangliogliomas and in
many patients with low-­grade astrocytomas. Though the majority of
intramedullary spinal cord tumors are benign, the extent of resection
may be limited in tumors that are diffusely infiltrating midline gliomas
because of tumor invasion and infiltration of gray and white matter
tracts. The invasive nature of these tumors is a leading cause of the poor
prognosis for many of these patients, resulting in symptom progression
and ultimately loss of neurologic function with profound implications
on both quality and extent of life and is one of the most significant
problems in spinal neurooncology. With the advent of routine molecular genetic testing, targetable pathogenic variants have been identified
in some intramedullary spinal cord tumors, which will potentially
expand nonsurgical and chemotherapeutic treatment options in as of
now unresectable spinal cord tumors. Adjunctive treatment is often
unnecessary in patients treated with adequate surgical resection. Likewise, schwannomas should be resectable. Occasionally, however, the
nerve root must be resected. Doing so may be of no consequence in
the thoracic spinal cord, but an attempt to remove the tumor while
salvaging the motor root in the cervical and lumbosacral region is
critical to preserve movement. Malignant astrocytic tumors cannot be
resected without major morbidity and, in any case, carry an extremely
poor prognosis. In the case of grades III and IV astrocytomas of the
spinal cord, decompression and biopsy followed by radiation therapy
and possibly chemotherapy are used.
The diagnosis and treatment of extramedullary spinal cord tumors
must be individualized. Patients with bony involvement may be at risk
of instability, and treatment will therefore involve both tumor resection
and stabilization of the spine. For extramedullary tumors with soft tissue components such as neuroblastomas, treatment is determined by
the nature of the tumor and degree of spinal cord compression and may
require needle biopsy of the lesion to direct treatment. In the absence
of significant neurologic compression, surgical intervention may not
be indicated if adjuvant therapies might be effective.

OUTCOME

The prognosis for patients with benign intramedullary spinal cord
tumors depends, to some extent, on the patient’s condition at the time
of surgical intervention. It is very unlikely that nonambulatory patients
will improve after surgery, and most patients will have at least transient worsening with surgery. If, however, patients are ambulatory at
the time of surgery, they are likely to recover at least to their preoperative level of function. The majority of intramedullary tumors in
children are benign and behave like tumors with the same histologic
findings in the brain. The evidence would point to the fact that intramedullary ependymomas act in a more benign fashion than they do in
the fourth ventricle. Gross total removal without adjuvant treatment is
the preferred method of treatment and carries not only a much longer
progression-­free survival time but an improved quality of life as well.
Malignant spinal cord tumors are usually lethal, with death resulting
from diffuse metastases via the CSF pathways. Successful resection of
nerve sheath tumors should be curative. In the context of neurofibromatosis, however, many more tumors can be found at other levels or
can be expected to develop later in life. Surgical intervention in the
context of neurofibromatoses should be performed only for clearly
symptomatic lesions.
The outcome of treatment of extramedullary tumors depends on the
cell type and, in most cases, on the efficacy of nonsurgical, adjunctive

646.5 Spinal Arteriovenous Malformations
Katie P. Fehnel and Mark R. Proctor
Arteriovenous malformations of the spinal cord are rare lesions in children. Only about 60 patients younger than age 18 years are treated in the
United States each year. These lesions are complex, and despite their rarity
there are multiple subtypes, which require different treatment strategies.
Patients commonly present with back or neck pain, depending on the
segments of the spinal cord involved, and they may experience the insidious onset of motor and sensory disturbances. Sudden onset of paraplegia
secondary to hemorrhage has been reported. Occasionally, patients present with subarachnoid hemorrhage without overt neurologic deficits,
similar to the presentation associated with cerebral aneurysms. In some
cases, bruits are audible upon auscultation over the bony spine.

DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION

When a spinal arteriovenous malformation is suspected, MRI of the
spinal cord is first needed to make the diagnosis and to obtain a general idea of the location of the lesion (Fig. 646.11). MR angiography
or CT angiography may provide further information, but formal catheter angiography of the spinal cord is needed to obtain an adequate
understanding of the complex anatomy of the lesion and to plan the
intervention.

TREATMENT

Open microsurgery had been the mainstay of treatment for spinal cord
arteriovenous fistulas and arteriovenous malformations. With the rapid
development of interventional techniques, the percentage of patients
undergoing microsurgery has decreased from 70% to approximately
30%. Stereotactic radiosurgery may be used adjunctively. Treatment of
these complex lesions requires the commitment of an organized neurovascular treatment program.

Chapter 647

Evaluation and
Investigation of
Neuromuscular Disorders
Adnan Y. Manzur*
The term neuromuscular disease defines disorders of the motor unit
and excludes influences on muscular function from the brain, such as
spasticity. The motor unit has four components: a motor neuron in the
brainstem or ventral horn of the spinal cord; its axon, which together
with other axons forms the peripheral nerve; the neuromuscular junction; and all muscle fibers innervated by a single motor neuron. The
size of the motor unit varies among different muscles and with the precision of muscular function required. In large muscles, such as the glutei and quadriceps femoris, hundreds of muscle fibers are innervated
by a single motor neuron; in small, finely tuned muscles, such as the
stapedius or the extraocular muscles, a 1:1 ratio can prevail. The motor
unit is influenced by suprasegmental or upper motor neuron control
that alters properties of muscle tone, precision of movement, reciprocal
inhibition of antagonistic muscles during movement, and sequencing
of muscle contractions to achieve smooth, coordinated movements.
Suprasegmental impulses also augment or inhibit the monosynaptic
stretch reflex; the corticospinal tract is inhibitory upon this reflex.
Diseases of the motor unit are common in children. These neuromuscular diseases may be genetically determined, congenital or
acquired, acute or chronic, and progressive or static. Because specific
therapy is available for many diseases and because of genetic and prognostic implications, a precise diagnosis is important; laboratory confirmation is required for most diseases because of overlapping clinical
manifestations. Precise genetic diagnosis, to the point of characterization of the specific pathogenic gene variant, is crucial for the genetically based neuromuscular disorders because of increasing availability
of specific genetic-­based treatments; examples include nonsense variants and exon-­specific treatments in Duchenne muscular dystrophy,
and gene therapy chromosome 5q linked spinal muscular atrophy.

GENETIC TESTING

Many chromosomal loci are identified with specific neuromuscular
diseases as a result of genetic linkage studies and the isolation and cloning of specific genes. In some cases, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the genetic variant is a deletion, duplication, or point variant of
nucleotide sequences and is associated with a defective protein product, dystrophin. In other cases, such as myotonic muscular dystrophy,
the genetic variant is an expansion or repetition, rather than a deletion,
in a codon (a set of three consecutive nucleotide repeats that encodes
for a single amino acid), with many copies of a particular codon (in
this example they are also associated with abnormal messenger RNA).
Some diseases manifest as autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive traits in different pedigrees; these distinct mendelian genotypes
can result from different genetic variants on different chromosomes

(nemaline myopathy) or from small differences in the same gene at
the same chromosomal locus (myotonia congenita), despite many
common phenotypic features and shared histopathologic findings in
a muscle biopsy specimen. Among the several clinically defined mitochondrial myopathies, specific mitochondrial DNA deletions and
transfer RNA point variants are recognized. The inheritance patterns
and chromosomal and mitochondrial loci of common neuromuscular
diseases affecting infants and children are summarized in Table 648.2
in Chapter 648.
Genotype:phenotype correlations are not always as precise as one
would like for diagnosis; many genetic variants, even on different chromosomes, cause the same phenotype, and the converse is also true in
that the same pathogenic genetic variant may yield many clinical phenotypes in different patients. Even a disease as stereotyped and predictable as Duchenne muscular dystrophy is known to be associated with
dozens of different genotype variations, in and out-­of-­frame deletions
and point variants of the large dystrophin gene. This explains why specific therapies might be beneficial for some patients and not alter the
natural course of the disease in others.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Examination of the neuromuscular system includes an assessment of
muscle bulk, tone, and strength. Tone and strength should not be confused: passive tone is range of motion around a joint, and active tone is
physiologic resistance to movement. Head lag when an infant is pulled
to a sitting position from supine is a sign of weakness, not of low tone.
Hypotonia may be associated with normal strength or with weakness;
enlarged muscles may be weak or strong; and thin, wasted muscles may
be weak or have unexpectedly normal strength. The distribution of
these components is of diagnostic importance. In general, myopathies
follow a proximal distribution of weakness and muscle wasting (with
the notable exception of myotonic muscular dystrophy). Neuropathies are generally distal in distribution, with the notable exception of
chromosome 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA 0,1,2,3; Table 647.1).
Involvement of the face, tongue, palate, and extraocular muscles provides an important distinction in the differential diagnosis. Tendon
stretch reflexes are generally lost in neuropathies and in motor neuron
diseases and are diminished but preserved in myopathies (see Table
647.1). A few specific clinical features are important in the diagnosis
of some neuromuscular diseases. Fasciculations of muscle, which are
often best seen in the tongue, are a sign of denervation. Sensory abnormalities indicate neuropathy. Fatigable weakness is characteristic of
neuromuscular junctional disorders. Myotonia is specific for myotonic
dystrophy and non-­dystrophic myotonias also described as skeletal
muscle channelopathies.
Some features do not distinguish myopathy from neuropathy.
Muscle pain or myalgias are associated with acute disease of either
myopathic or neurogenic origin. Acute dermatomyositis and acute
polyneuropathy (Guillain-­Barré syndrome) are characterized by myalgias. Muscle pain is unusual in most muscular dystrophies and spinal
muscular atrophies at presentation, but myalgia and cramps on exercise are a characteristic feature of Becker muscular dystrophy. Myalgias also occur in several metabolic diseases of muscle and in ischemic
myopathy, including vascular diseases such as dermatomyositis. Myalgias denote the acuity, rather than the nature, of the process, so that
progressive but chronic diseases, such as muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy, are not painful, but acute stages of inflammatory myopathies and acute denervation of muscle often do present with
muscular pain and tenderness to palpation. Contractures of muscles,
whether present at birth or developing later in the course of an illness,
occur in both myopathic and neurogenic diseases.

Infant males who are weak in late fetal life and in the neonatal period
often have undescended testes. The testes are actively pulled into the
scrotum from the anterior abdominal wall by a pair of cords that consist of smooth and striated muscle called the gubernacula. The gubernacula are weakened in many congenital neuromuscular diseases,
including spinal muscular atrophy, myotonic muscular dystrophy, and
many congenital myopathies.
The thorax of infants with congenital neuromuscular disease often
has a funnel shape, and the ribs are thin and radiolucent as a result of
intercostal muscle weakness during intrauterine growth. This phenomenon is characteristically found in infantile spinal muscular atrophy
but also occurs in myotubular myopathy, neonatal myotonic dystrophy,

and other disorders (Fig. 647.1). Because of the small muscle mass, the
birthweight may be low for gestational age.
Generalized hypotonia and motor developmental delay are the
most common presenting manifestations of neuromuscular disease in
infants and young children (Table 647.2 and Figs. 647.2-­647.4). These
features can also be expressions of neurologic disease, endocrine and
systemic metabolic diseases, and Down syndrome, or they may be
nonspecific neuromuscular expressions of malnutrition or chronic systemic illness (Table 647.3). A prenatal history of decreased fetal movements and intrauterine growth retardation is often found in patients
who are symptomatic at birth. Developmental disorders tend to be of
slow onset and are progressive. Acute flaccid paralysis in older infants

Chapter 647 u Evaluation and Investigation of Neuromuscular Disorders
and children has a different differential diagnosis (Tables 647.4 and
647.5; see Fig. 647.3).

LABORATORY FINDINGS
Serum Enzymes

Several lysosomal enzymes are released by damaged or degenerating muscle fibers and may be measured in serum. The most useful of
these enzymes is creatine kinase (CK), which is mainly found in three
organs and may be separated into corresponding isozymes: MM for
skeletal muscle, MB for cardiac muscle, and BB for brain. Serum CK
determination is not a universal screening test for neuromuscular disease because many diseases of the motor unit are not associated with
elevated enzymes. The CK level is characteristically elevated in certain

3793

diseases, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and the magnitude of
increase is characteristic for particular diseases. CK may also be elevated in certain nonneuromuscular disorders (Table 647.6).
Rhabdomyolysis is often a dramatic event associated with high
plasma CK levels, myoglobinuria, and muscle pain or tenderness. It
may be acquired (Table 647.7; see Fig. 647.4), due to metabolic diseases
(Table 647.8), or occur spontaneously or secondary to various triggers
(Fig. 647.5).

Molecular Genetic Markers

Many DNA markers of hereditary neuromuscular diseases, including
the common muscular dystrophies, and neuropathies are available
from specific gene panels or whole exome or genome sequencing.
If the clinical manifestations for a positive family history suggest a
particular disease, these genetic tests can provide a definitive diagnosis and not subject the child to more invasive procedures, such as
muscle biopsy. Other molecular markers are available only in muscle
biopsy tissue.

Nerve Conduction Velocity

Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity may be measured electrophysiologically by using surface electrodes. Neuropathies of various
types are detected by decreased conduction. The site of a traumatic
nerve injury may also be localized. The nerve conduction value at birth
is about half of the mature value achieved by the age of 2 years. Tables
are available for normal values at various ages in infancy, including for
preterm infants. Because the nerve conduction velocity study measures
only the fastest conducting fibers in a nerve, 80% of the total nerve
fibers must be involved before slowing in conduction is detected.

external rotation (B) at the shoulders. Note also intercostal recession,
especially evident in B, and normal facial expressions. (From Volpe J.
Neurology of the Newborn, 4th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders; 2001: p
645.)

Electromyography (EMG) requires insertion of a needle into the belly
of a muscle and recording of the electrical potentials in various states
of contraction. It is less useful in pediatrics than in adult medicine, in
part because of technical difficulties in recording these potentials in
young children and in part because the best results require the patient’s
cooperation for full relaxation and maximal voluntary contraction of a
muscle. Many children are too frightened to provide such cooperation.
Characteristic EMG patterns distinguish denervation from myopathic
involvement. The specific type of myopathy is not usually definitively
diagnosed, but certain specialized myopathic conditions, such as myotonia, may be demonstrated. An EMG can transiently raise the serum
CK level.
EMG combined with repetitive electrical stimulation of a motor
nerve supplying a muscle to produce tetany is useful in demonstrating myasthenic decremental responses. Small muscles, such as the

abductor digiti quinti of the hypothenar eminence, are used for such
studies. Additional specialized tests, such as single myofiber EMG, may
provide supplementary evidence in selected cases, but are performed
only in large neuromuscular centers.

IMAGING OF MUSCLES AND THE CENTRAL
NERVOUS SYSTEM

Ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) scans, and, more often
and most helpful, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to
image muscle in many neuromuscular diseases. Although these methods are not always definitively diagnostic, in experienced hands, they
provide a supplementary means of following the progression of disease
over time. MRI is quite useful in identifying inflammatory myopathies
of immune (dermatomyositis) or infectious (viral, bacterial, parasitic)
origin. MRI is the study of choice to image the spinal cord, if a tumor

or other structural lesion of the spinal cord is suspected as the cause of
muscular dysfunction, and the nerve roots and plexus (e.g., brachial
plexus). Brain MRI is indicated in some myopathies, such as the congenital muscular dystrophies, in which cerebral malformations often
accompany the myopathy because the mutated gene responsible is
expressed in both muscle and the developing brain.

MUSCLE BIOPSY

The muscle biopsy is traditionally the most important and specific
diagnostic study of most neuromuscular disorders. Molecular genetic
diagnosis supersedes the muscle biopsy or renders it as secondary in
diagnostic importance, to be used if a definitive diagnosis of a hereditary disease is not provided by molecular genetic testing in blood. Thus
the muscle biopsy is no longer essential for spinal muscular atrophy,
most muscular dystrophies, and most congenital myopathies. Muscle

biopsy remains useful in select cases, however, to provide morphologic
details and metabolic profiles not revealed by genetic testing alone or
as a primary diagnostic procedure if the genetics are equivocal or negative. Not only are neurogenic and myopathic processes distinguished
by muscle biopsy, but the type of myopathy and specific enzymatic
deficiencies also may be determined. In addition, there are conditions
that may have associated identifiable disease-­causing genes in most but
not all patients.
The vastus lateralis (quadriceps femoris) is most frequently sampled.
The deltoid should be avoided in most cases because it normally exhibits a 60–80% predominance of type I fibers, so that the distribution

patterns of fiber types are difficult to recognize. Muscle biopsy is a simple outpatient procedure that may be performed under local anesthesia
with or without femoral nerve block. Needle biopsies are preferred in
some centers but are not percutaneous and require an incision in the
skin similar to open biopsy; numerous samples must be taken to conduct an adequate examination of the tissue, and they provide inferior
specimens. The volume of tissue from a needle biopsy is usually not
adequate for all required studies, including supplementary biochemical studies, such as mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes; a small,
clean, open biopsy is therefore advantageous.
Histochemical studies of frozen sections of the muscle are obligatory
in all pediatric muscle biopsies because many congenital and metabolic
myopathies cannot be diagnosed from paraffin sections using conventional histologic stains. Immunohistochemistry is a useful supplement
in some cases, such as for demonstrating dystrophin in suspected
Duchenne muscular dystrophy or merosin in congenital muscular dystrophy. A portion of the biopsy specimen should be fixed for potential
electron microscopy, but the ultrastructure has additional diagnostic
value only in selected cases. Interpretation of muscle biopsy samples
is complex and should be performed by an experienced pathologist.
A portion of frozen muscle tissue should also be routinely saved for
possible biochemical analysis (mitochondrial cytopathies, carnitine
palmitoyltransferase, acid maltase).
Immunocytochemical reactivities can be applied to formalin-­fixed,
paraffin-­embedded sections and do not require frozen sections. Some
reactivities, such as slow and fast myosin, can distinguish fiber types
and hence substitute for myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase histochemical stains in frozen sections. An increasing number of sarcolemmal regional proteins can be demonstrated that are specific for each of
the various muscular dystrophies and include the dystrophins, merosin, sarcoglycans, and dystroglycans. Ryanodine receptors, important
in myasthenia gravis and in malignant hyperthermia, also can be
demonstrated. In addition, immunocytochemical reactivities can distinguish the various types of inflammatory cells in autoimmune myopathies, including T and B lymphocytes and macrophages.

NERVE BIOPSY

Nerve biopsy is applied less frequently because of the precision
diagnosis of many hereditary peripheral neuropathies by less invasive and more specific genetic diagnosis. In some cases not definitively diagnosed by genetic testing, the nerve biopsy still provides
valuable diagnostic information. The most commonly sampled
nerve is the sural nerve, a pure sensory nerve that supplies a small
area of skin on the lateral surface of the foot. Whole or fascicular
biopsy specimens of this nerve may be taken. When the sural nerve

is severed behind the lateral malleolus of the ankle, regeneration
of the nerve occurs in more than 90% of cases, so that permanent
sensory loss is not experienced. The sural nerve is often involved
in many neuropathies in which the clinical manifestations are predominantly motor.
Electron microscopy is performed on most nerve biopsy specimens because many morphologic alterations cannot be appreciated
at the resolution of a light microscope. Teased fiber preparations are
sometimes useful in demonstrating segmental demyelination, axonal
swellings, and other specific abnormalities, but these time-­consuming
procedures are not done routinely. Special stains may be applied to
ordinary frozen or paraffin sections of nerve biopsy material to demonstrate myelin, axoplasm, and metabolic products.

CARDIAC ASSESSMENT

Cardiac evaluation is important if myopathy is suspected because of involvement of the heart in muscular dystrophies and in inflammatory and metabolic myopathies (Table 647.9). Electrocardiography often detects early
cardiomyopathy or conduction defects that are clinically asymptomatic. At
times, a more complete cardiac workup, including echocardiography and
consultation with a pediatric cardiologist, is indicated. Serial pulmonary
function tests also should be performed in muscular dystrophies and in
other chronic or progressive diseases of the motor unit.

Chapter 648 u Developmental Disorders of Muscle

Chapter 648

Developmental Disorders
of Muscle
Adnan Y. Manzur*
A heterogeneous group of congenital neuromuscular disorders is
known as congenital myopathies (see Tables 649.1-­649.7 in Chapter
649; Tables 648.1 and 648.2). Most of these disorders have subcellular abnormalities that can be demonstrated only by muscle biopsy,
by means of histochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and electron
microscopy. In others, the muscle biopsy abnormality is not a subcellular anatomic defect but an aberration in the ratio and sizes of specific myofiber types. A genetic etiology is demonstrated in most of
the congenital myopathies, and molecular genetic testing from blood
samples may confirm the diagnosis without muscle biopsy in several of
the congenital myopathies, muscular dystrophies, and spinal muscular
atrophy (SMA).
Most congenital myopathies are nonprogressive conditions, but some
patients show slow clinical deterioration accompanied by additional
changes in their muscle histology. In some congenital myopathies, such
as severe neonatal nemaline myopathy, the clinical expression can be
life-­threatening because of dysphagia and respiratory and/or cardiac
insufficiency. Cardiomyopathy develops in some patients with congenital myopathies (Table 648.3). Most of the diseases in the category
of congenital myopathies are hereditary, some as classical mendelian
traits and others as sporadic or novel point variants. Though clinical
features (Table 648.4), including phenotype, can raise a strong suspicion of a congenital myopathy, the definitive diagnosis is determined
by the histopathologic findings in the muscle biopsy specimen or by
genetic testing in lymphocytes, most commonly by testing for panels
of genes with next-­generation sequencing (NGS). The morphologic
and histochemical abnormalities differ considerably from those of
the muscular dystrophies, spinal muscular atrophies, and neuropathies, but there may be coexpression, exemplified by congenital muscle
fiber–type disproportion (CMFTD) in infantile myotonic dystrophy.
Many are reminiscent of the embryologic development of muscle,
thus suggesting possible defects in the genetic regulation of muscle
development.
Congenital myopathies often show closer genetic relationships than
previously appreciated between entities that have quite distinct pathologic phenotypes in the muscle biopsy and distinctiveness in clinical
expression with a degree of overlap. Pathogenic variants of the TPM3
gene are one of the well-­documented etiologies of nemaline myopathy,
but identical genetic variants of this gene are also shown to be capable
of causing isolated congenital fiber–type disproportion without nemaline rods, cap myopathy, centronuclear (“myotubular”) myopathy, and
central core/minicore disease.

MYOGENIC REGULATORY GENES AND GENETIC
LOCI OF INHERITED DISEASES OF MUSCLE

A family of four myogenic regulatory genes shares encoding transcription factors of basic helix-­loop-­helix proteins associated with common
DNA nucleotide sequences. These genes direct the differentiation of
striated muscle from any undifferentiated mesodermal cell. The earliest
basic helix-­loop-­helix gene to program the differentiation of myoblasts
is myogenic factor 5 (MYF5). The second gene, myogenin, promotes
fusion of myoblasts to form myotubes. Herculin (also known as MYF6)
and MYOD1 are the other two myogenic genes. Myf5 cannot support
myogenic differentiation without myogenin, MyoD, and MYF6. Each of

these four genes can activate the expression of at least one other and,
under certain circumstances, can autoactivate as well. Another gene
known as myomaker also facilitates myoblast fusion. The expression of
MYF5 and of herculin is transient in early ontogenesis but returns later
in fetal life and persists into adult life.
The human locus of the MYOD1 gene is on chromosome 11, very
near to the domain associated with embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.
The genes Myf5 and herculin are on chromosome 12, and myogenin is
on chromosome 1.
The myogenic genes are activated during muscle regeneration, recapitulating the developmental process; MyoD in particular is required
for myogenic stem cell (progenitor satellite cell) activation in adult
muscle. The PAX3, PAX7, and WNT3a genes also play important roles
in myogenesis and interact with each of the four basic genes mentioned
earlier. Another gene, myostatin, is a negative regulator of muscle
development by preventing myocytes from differentiating.
The myogenic genes are important not only for fetal myogenesis but
also for regeneration of muscle at any age, particularly in degenerative diseases such as muscular dystrophies and autoimmune inflammatory myopathies and in injuries of muscle secondary to trauma or to
toxins. Satellite cells in mature muscle that mediate regeneration have
the same somitic origin as embryonic muscle progenitor cells, but the
genes that regulate them differ. Pax3 and Pax7 mediate the migration
of primitive myoblast progenitors from the myotomes of the somites to
their peripheral muscle sites in the embryo, but only one of two Pax7
genes continues to act postnatally for satellite cell survival. Then it, too,
no longer is required after the juvenile period for muscle satellite (i.e.,
stem) cells to become activated for muscle regeneration.

Treatment remains largely supportive care for respiratory insufficiency and feeding and swallowing difficulties in particular, but genetic
approaches specific for identified mutations are being investigated and
may eventually reverse some of the most disabling clinical deficits.
Administration of steroids, as well as other antiinflammatory agents,
which is useful in many patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy,
is not effective for the congenital myopathies. There is optimism for
efficacy of adenoviral vector-­based gene therapy for some of the congenital myopathies, and X-­linked MTM1 gene–related myotubular
myopathy is a good example where efficacy and safety is being evaluated in human clinical trials. Long-­term outcomes for some congenital
myopathies are noted in Figures 648.1 and 648.2.

Adnan Y. Manzur
The term myotubular myopathy is a misnomer because it implies maturational arrest of fetal muscle during the myotubular stage of development at 8-­15 weeks of gestation. It was based on the morphologic
appearance of myofibers as a row of central nuclei and mitochondria
within a core of cytoplasm, with contractile myofibrils forming a cylinder around this core. These morphologically abnormal myofibers are
not true fetal myotubes; hence, the more neutral and descriptive term
centronuclear myopathy (CNM) is preferred.

PATHOGENESIS

The common pathogenesis involves loss of myotubularin protein,
leading to structural and functional abnormalities in the organization of T-­tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum and defective excitation-­
contraction coupling. In true fetal myotubes, the peripheral migration
of central nuclei and the core of internuclear mitochondria is initiated

by the regression of fetal vimentin intermediate filaments at 15-­20
weeks of gestation that hold these structures in the center of the myotube, but this is not the mechanism of centronuclear myopathies,
except perhaps in neonatal myotonic dystrophy, which does involve
maturational arrest of some myofibers.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Fetal movements can decrease in late gestation. Polyhydramnios is a
common complication because of pharyngeal weakness of the fetus
and inability to swallow amniotic fluid.
At birth, affected infants have a thin muscle mass involving axial,
limb girdle, and distal muscles; severe generalized hypotonia; and
diffuse weakness. Respiratory efforts may be ineffective, requiring
ventilatory support. Gavage feeding may be required because of weakness of the muscles of sucking and deglutition. The testes are often

feature. Ophthalmoplegia is observed in a few cases. The palate may be
high. The tongue is thin, but fasciculations are not seen. Tendon stretch
reflexes are weak or absent.
Myotubular myopathy is not associated with cardiomyopathy
(mature cardiac muscle fibers normally have central nuclei), but one
report describes complete atrioventricular block without cardiomyopathy in a patient with confirmed X-­linked myotubular myopathy.
Congenital anomalies of the central nervous system (CNS) or of other
systems are not associated. A single patient with progressive dementia
was reported that had a variant removing the start signal of exon 2.
Patients with much milder symptoms or a much later age of onset with
variants in the same gene are also known. Some of these are manifesting carriers.

Serum levels of creatine kinase (CK) are normal. Electromyography
does not show evidence of denervation; results are usually normal or
show minimal nonspecific myopathic features in early infancy. Nerve
conduction velocity may be slow but is usually normal. The electrocardiogram appears normal. Chest radiographs show no cardiomegaly;
the ribs may be thin.

DIAGNOSIS

If the diagnosis is strongly suspected from the clinical presentation,
especially if this diagnosis was confirmed in a sibling, genetic tests
can be performed in the neonatal period. In most cases the diagnosis is not so evident, but the muscle biopsy findings are diagnostic at
birth, even in premature infants. More than 90% of muscle fibers are
small and have centrally placed, large vesicular nuclei in a single row.
Spaces between nuclei are filled with sarcoplasm containing mitochondria. Histochemical stains for oxidative enzymatic activity and glycogen reveal a central distribution as in fetal myotubes. The cylinder of
myofibrils shows mature histochemical differentiation with adenosine
triphosphatase stains. The connective tissue of muscle spindles, blood
vessels, intramuscular nerves, and motor end plates is mature. Ultrastructural features other than those that define the disease are also
mature. Electron microscopy shows disorganized triads and focal loss
of myofilaments. Vimentin and desmin show strong immunoreactivity in muscle fibers in congenital CNM and no demonstrable activity
in normal-­term neonatal muscle. Several myotubularins are present in
circulating platelets and may prove to be a simple noninvasive screening test in patients suspected of having this disease. The molecular
genetic marker in blood is available also for early prenatal diagnosis
if suspicion is strong because of a family history. Prenatal diagnosis by
amniocentesis is feasible in strongly suspected involved fetuses. Table
648.5 distinguishes CNM from other congenital myopathies.

GENETICS

At least five genes are involved in this disorder and account for
approximately 80% of patients. These include variants in myotubularin (MTM1 gene) with X-­linked severe manifestations; dynamin 2

(DNM2) with autosomal dominant or sporadic occurrence; amphiphysin 2 (BIN1) and titin (TTN) variants with autosomal recessive inheritance and ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1), with autosomal recessive or
sporadic occurrence.
X-­linked recessive inheritance is the most common trait in this disease affecting males. The mothers of affected infants are clinically
asymptomatic, but their muscle biopsy specimens show minor alterations. Genetic linkage on the X chromosome has been localized to
the Xq28 site, a locus different from the Xp21 gene of Duchenne and
Becker muscular dystrophies. A deletion in the responsible MTM1
gene has been identified. It encodes a protein called myotubularin. This
gene belongs to a family of similar genes encoding enzymatically active
and inactive forms of phosphatidylinositol-­3-­phosphatases that form
dimers. MTM1, dynamin-­2, and amphiphysin all are localized to the
T-­tubule wall in triads. This crucial region is where the action potential releases a signal to the ryanodine receptor to release calcium. The
pathogenesis is in the regulation of enzymatic activity and binding to
other proteins induced by dimer interactions. Although only a single
MTM1 gene is involved, five distinct point variants and many different alleles, as well as large duplications, can produce the same clinical disease. Variants in the dynamin-­2 protein result in an autosomal
dominant form of CNM and may account for up to half of all patients
with CNM, but these cases usually are mild and might not manifest
clinically until adult life as diffuse, slowly progressive weakness and
generalized muscular pseudohypertrophy.
Other rarer centronuclear myopathies are also known; some are
autosomal recessive and affect both sexes and others are sporadic and
of unknown genetic origin. The recessive forms are sometimes divided
into an early-­onset form with or without ophthalmoplegia and a late-­
onset form without ophthalmoplegia.

TREATMENT

Only supportive and palliative treatment is presently available. Progressive scoliosis may be treated by long posterior fusion. Genetic
and neuropathologic studies of X-­linked centronuclear (myotubular)
myopathy have led to effective gene therapy in mice and in dogs, so
that the animals are more ambulatory and have improved weakness;
the therapy results in long-­term expression of the myotubularin transgene with normal muscular performance and neurologic function in
the absence of muscle pathology. Human trials of gene therapy for
X-­linked CNM are in progress.

PROGNOSIS

Approximately 75% of severely affected neonates with the X-­linked disease die within the first few weeks or months of life. Survivors experience a slowly progressive course and have major physical handicaps,
rarely walk, remain severely hypotonic and weak, and mostly ventilator
dependent. Late-­onset and especially autosomal dominant forms have
a much better prognosis, often with mild static weakness. Treatment by
gene therapy may dramatically change this prognosis.

648.2 Congenital Muscle Fiber–Type
Disproportion
Adnan Y. Manzur
Congenital muscle fiber–type disproportion (CMFTD) occurs as an
isolated congenital myopathy but also develops in association with
various unrelated disorders, which include nemaline rod disease and
Krabbe disease (globoid cell leukodystrophy), early in the course
before the expression of the neuropathy; congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) with merosin deficiency (occasionally); cerebellar hypoplasia and certain other brain malformations; fetal alcohol syndrome;
some glycogenoses; multiple sulfatase deficiency; Lowe syndrome;
rigid spine myopathy; and some infantile cases of myotonic muscular
dystrophy. CMFTD is, therefore, a syndrome. Several specific genetic

variants are confirmed causing the CMFTD histologic appearance and
these include TPM2, TPM3, MYH7, RYR1, skeletal muscle α-­actin
gene (ACTA1), and LMNA.

PATHOGENESIS

The association of CMFTD with cerebellar hypoplasia suggests that the
pathogenesis may be an abnormal suprasegmental influence on the
developing motor unit during the stage of histochemical differentiation
of muscle between 20 and 28 weeks of gestation. Muscle fiber types and
growth are determined by innervation and are mutable even in adults.
Although CMFTD does not actually correspond with any normal stage
of development, it appears to be an embryologic disturbance of fiber-­
type differentiation and growth.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

As an isolated condition not associated with other diseases, CMFTD is
usually a nonprogressive disorder present at birth. Patients have generalized hypotonia and weakness, but the weakness is usually not severe.
Contractures are present at birth in 25% of patients. Poor head control
and developmental delay for gross motor skills are common in infancy.
Walking is usually delayed until 18-­
24 months but is eventually
achieved. Because of the hypotonia, subluxation of the hips can occur.
Muscle bulk is reduced. The muscle wasting and hypotonia are proportionately greater than the weakness, and the child may be stronger
than expected during examination. Cardiomyopathy is a rare complication. Respiratory weakness usually is mild but can be demonstrated
in 30% of neonates and young infants. Dysphagia is infrequent except
if CMFTD is secondary to myotonic dystrophy, nemaline myopathy, or
a systemic metabolic disease with additional encephalopathy.
The facies of children with CMFTD often raise suspicion, especially
if the child is referred for assessment of developmental delay and hypotonia. The head is dolichocephalic, and facial weakness is present. The
palate is usually high arched. Thin muscles of the trunk and extremities give a thin, wasted appearance. The phenotype is very similar to
that of nemaline myopathy, which also includes CMFTD as part of the
pathologic phenotype. Patients do not complain of myalgias. The clinical course generally is nonprogressive or only slowly progressive unless
it is associated with other congenital myopathies.

LABORATORY FINDINGS

The serum CK, electrocardiogram, electromyography studies, and
nerve conduction velocity results are normal in isolated CMFTD. If
other diseases are associated, laboratory investigation of those conditions discloses the specific features. Specific genetic studies are indicated if there is a family history.

DIAGNOSIS

CMFTD is diagnosed by muscle biopsy that shows a disproportion in
the size and relative ratios of the histochemical fiber types: type I fibers
are uniformly small, and type II fibers are hypertrophic; type I fibers
are more numerous than type II fibers. Degeneration of myofibers and
other primary myopathic features are absent. The biopsy is diagnostic
at birth. Table 648.5 lists the features that distinguish CMFTD from
other congenital myopathies. Selective atrophy or even hypoplasia of
type II myofibers is not CMFTD, though it has sometimes been labeled
as reverse CMFTD.

GENETICS

Many cases of simple CMFTD are sporadic, although an autosomal
recessive inheritance is well documented in some families and an
autosomal dominant trait is suspected in others. The genetic basis is
heterogeneous in hereditary forms; a pathogenic variant in the insulin
receptor gene at 19p13.2 is reported. Translocation t(10;17) was seen in
one family. X-­linked transmission with linkage to Xp23.12-­p11.4 and
Xq13.1-­q22.1 is also described. LMNA gene variants produce familial
CMFTD, clearly a germline genetic variant with mendelian autosomal
transmission. In three unrelated families with CMFTD, a heterozygous missense variant of the skeletal muscle α-­actin gene (ACTA1) was
demonstrated, but this genetic defect represents a minority; variants in

Chapter 648 u Developmental Disorders of Muscle
TPM3 or TPM2 are the more common genetic findings. Large duplications in the TPM3 gene can cause CMFTD. MYH7 de novo gene
variants lead to exon skipping. CMFTD may occur in RYR1 disease
without obvious cores on muscle biopsy. In CMFTD associated with
cerebellar hypoplasia, the epigenetic effect is on cerebellar development and the muscular expression is secondary.

TREATMENT

No drug therapy is available. Physiotherapy may be helpful for some
patients in strengthening muscles that do not receive sufficient exercise
in daily activities. Mild congenital contractures often respond well to
gentle range-­of-­motion exercises and rarely require plaster casting or
surgery. The relative rarity of early-­onset congenital myopathies such
as CMFTD and the diversity of the genotype make focused gene therapies difficult, but the identification of specific molecular mechanisms
and novel gene editing strategies are a basis for future therapy.

648.3 Nemaline Rod Myopathy
Adnan Y. Manzur
Nemaline rods are rod-­
shaped, inclusion-­
like abnormal structures
within muscle fibers. They are difficult to demonstrate histologically
with conventional hematoxylin and eosin stain but are easily seen with
special stains. They are not foreign inclusion bodies but rather consist
of excessive Z-­band material with a similar ultrastructure (Fig. 648.3).
Chemically, the rods are composed of actin, α-­actinin, tropomyosin-­3,
and the protein nebulin. Nemaline rod formation may be an unusual
reaction of muscle fibers to injury because these rod structures have
rarely been found in other diseases. They are most abundant in the congenital myopathy known as nemaline rod disease. Most rods are within
the myofibrils, but intranuclear rods are occasionally demonstrated by
electron microscopy. Intranuclear rods occur mainly in neonates with
severe weakness. Fourteen causative genes have been identified, and
ACTA1 pathologic variants account for more than half of the severe
cases. Nemaline myopathy caused by an ACTA1 gene variant is one of
a spectrum of actinopathies.
Pathologic variants in TPM2 can cause a congenital myopathy
related to nemaline rod myopathy, designated cap myopathy, in which
accumulations of distorted myofilaments are focally present on the
periphery of fibers. They may coexist with myofibrillar nemaline rods.
Somatic mosaicism is demonstrated in TPM2-­related nemaline myopathy with cap structures.

3811

Gene variants in muscle-­
specific Kelch BTB genes (KBTBD13,
KLHL40, KLHL41) cause nemaline myopathy with potential pathologic
signatures on muscle biopsy. Autosomal dominant KBTBD13 gene
variants are identified in families with nemaline myopathy and cores.
Autosomal recessive KLHL40 and KLHL41 variants are described in
severe early onset nemaline myopathy with fetal akinesia phenotypes
and congenital fractures (see Chapter 648.10).

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Prenatal, neonatal, infantile, juvenile, and adult-­onset forms of the disease are known. There is a highly variable degree of muscle weakness,
ranging from presentations within the fetal akinesia spectrum to only
mildly affected adults. All defining features of congenital myopathies
can occur in different contexts; although there is not a clear genotype-­
phenotype correlation, there may be clinical clues for specific gene
variants. Prenatal and neonatal forms are severe and usually fatal
because of respiratory failure since birth. In the infantile form, generalized hypotonia and weakness, which can include bulbar-­innervated
and respiratory muscles, and a very thin muscle mass are characteristic
(Fig. 648.4). The head is dolichocephalic, and the palate high arched or
even cleft. Muscles of the jaw may be too weak to hold it closed (Fig.
648.5). Decreased fetal movements are reported by the mother, and
neonates suffer from hypoxia and dysphagia; arthrogryposis may be
present (see Chapter 648.10). Infants with severe neonatal and infantile nemaline myopathy have facies and a phenotype that are nearly
indistinguishable from those of neonatal myotonic dystrophy, but their
mothers have normal facies.
In NEB-­related nemaline myopathy, which is the most common
form, patients usually present in infancy or childhood, and there is
a disproportional axial and bulbar involvement compared with limb
weakness. In spite of preserved ambulation, scoliosis and respiratory
involvement are universal. Distal muscle involvement may be a presenting feature in some patients. ACTA1-­related nemaline myopathy
is typically severe, and additional phenotypes include (1) progressive
scapuloperoneal and distal weakness in a large single family with autosomal dominant inheritance, demonstrating muscle atrophy without
nemaline rods; (2) a severe congenital presentation with myofibrillar features on muscle biopsy; (3) limb-­girdle muscular dystrophy
(LGMD) phenotype; (4) autosomal recessive CMD with a rigid spine;

constituting the thin filaments of myofibrils or regulate thin-­filament
organization and stability. Overall, recessive gene variants in NEB and
de novo dominant gene variants in ACTA1 are most common, and
represent approximately 50% and 25% of cases, respectively. TNNT1
nemaline myopathy known to be specific for Old Order Amish populations is also identified in other populations. Gene variants in muscle
specific Kelch proteins are increasingly recognized. KBTBD13 nemaline myopathy is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance and
phenotypic variability. KLHL40 and KLHL41 nemaline myopathies
represent the severest end of the spectrum, with in utero presentations, fetal akinesia, arthrogryposis, congenital fractures, and specific
signatures on muscle biopsy samples (see Chapter 648.10). Kelch-­BTB
proteins act as E3-­ubiquitin ligases and mediate protein turnover. In
animal and cell culture studies, KLHL40 was shown to stabilize leiomodin-­3 (Lmod3) and the absence of KLHL40 was shown to reduce
Lmod3 and Neb, which was further confirmed in muscle biopsy samples of some patients with KLHL40. This led to identification of pathologic variants in the gene encoding leiomodin-­3, a protein especially
present at the pointed end of muscle thin filaments. LMOD3 nemaline
myopathy is characterized by a severe phenotype with, again, potential
hallmarks on muscle biopsy.

TREATMENT AND PROGNOSIS

and (5) zebra body myopathy. Cardiomyopathy is not a feature of NEB-­
related nemaline myopathy; however, it has been rarely reported in
patients with ACTA1 gene variants.
The juvenile form is the mildest and is not associated with respiratory failure, but the phenotype, including facial involvement, is similar.
Adult-­onset presentations are in the form of slowly progressive proximal weakness with axial involvement, and although not symptomatic
in childhood and adolescence, these patients retrospectively report difficulties with sportive activities in childhood.

LABORATORY FINDINGS

The serum CK level is normal or mildly elevated. The muscle biopsy
is diagnostic. In addition to the characteristic nemaline rods, it also
shows CMFTD or, at least, fiber-­type I predominance. In some patients,
uniform type I fibers are seen with few or no type II fibers. Focal myofibrillar degeneration and an increase in lysosomal enzymes have been
found in a few severe cases associated with progressive symptoms.
Intranuclear nemaline rods, demonstrated by electron microscopy,
are correlated with the most severe neonatal manifestations. Potential
pathologic hallmarks of KLHL40 gene variants are miliary bodies and
LMOD3 gene variants; the latter are a fringe of thin filaments radiating
from the nemaline bodies and paired nemaline bodies interconnected
by thin filaments. Because nemaline bodies can occur in other myopathies, their presence in the muscle biopsy is not pathognomonic in the
absence of the supportive clinical manifestations. Sporadic late-­onset
nemaline myopathy (SLONM) may be associated with monoclonal
gammopathy, HIV infection, and various autoimmune disorders, and
should be differentiated from genetic causes because it is a potentially
treatable condition.

GENETICS

Autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-­linked dominant
forms in females can occur. Nemaline myopathy can be caused by
gene variants in at least 10 genes, including ACTA1 (skeletal muscle
α-­actin), NEB (nebulin), TPM3 (slow muscle αα-­tropomyosin), TPM2
(ββ-­tropomyosin), CFL2 (skeletal muscle cofilin), TNNT1 (slow muscle troponin-­T), LMOD3 (leiomodin 3), KBTBD13 (Kelch-­repeat and
BTB domain containing 13), KLHL40, and KLHL41 (Kelch-­like 40 and
41). All of the genes implicated in nemaline myopathy encode proteins

There is no cure, and management is mainly supportive and symptomatic. Survivors are usually wheelchair dependent and unable to
overcome gravity. Both proximal and distal muscles are involved.
Congenital arthrogryposis and fractures can occur and predict a poor
prognosis. Gastrostomy may be needed for chronic dysphagia. Special
attention to respiratory function in patients presenting with scoliosis
and axial involvement is important to recognize early signs and symptoms of nocturnal hypoventilation syndrome. In the juvenile form,
patients are ambulatory and are able to perform most tasks of daily living. Weakness is not usually progressive, but some patients have more
difficulty over time or enter a phase of progressive weakness. Cardiomyopathy is an uncommon complication. Death usually results from
respiratory insufficiency, with or without superimposed pneumonia.
Based on preclinical data in experimental models of ACTA1-­related
nemaline myopathy, a variety of pharmacologic compounds and
supplements, including L-­tyrosine, have been tested in five patients
with nemaline myopathy; a beneficial effect has been suggested, with
reduced fatigue and improvement of drooling. Treatments targeting the neuromuscular junction are another option; a single patient
with KLHL40-­
related nemaline myopathy had a sustained beneficial response to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine, a
result that corresponds to experiences in other congenital myopathies,
mainly centronuclear myopathies. Drugs targeting thin filaments and
their interactions, myostatin inhibitors to promote muscle growth, and
cardiac α-­actin upregulation in ACTA1-­related nemaline myopathy are
being investigated in animal models.
Despite advances in our understanding of pathophysiologic concepts and efforts for therapy, genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis
should be considered in families with an index patient and a precise
genetic diagnosis.

648.4 Core Myopathies
Adnan Y. Manzur
The core myopathies are the most common form of congenital myopathy, consisting of central core diseases (CCDs), multiminicore disease
(MmD), and atypical cores. Cores are regions within muscle fibers in
which only amorphous, granular cytoplasm is found, with an absence
of myofibrils and organelles. Cores are devoid of mitochondria that
contain disordered sarcomeric proteins. Histochemical stains show a
lack of enzymatic activities of all types within these cores, as well as an
absence of contractile proteins (actin and myosin) that form the thin

Chapter 648 u Developmental Disorders of Muscle
and thick myofilaments. Longitudinally extensive areas in the central
area of myofiber devoid of oxidative enzyme activity represent central
cores, and multiple smaller areas of reduced activity affecting shorter
segments of the myofiber are characteristic of multicores and minicores. On electron microscopy, cores are characterized by an abnormal
sarcomeric structure, including Z-­band streaming, complete myofibrillary disorganization, and accumulation of Z-­band material. Although
variants of central cores, called minicores and multicores, are described
in some families, they are believed to represent the same basic disease
process. Pathologic features may evolve, with changes and abnormalities becoming more evident over time.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

The phenotypical spectrum of core myopathies ranges from mild to
severe. Hypotonia, joint laxity, motor developmental delay, hip girdle
or axial muscle weakness, orthopedic complications such as recurrent
shoulder or patellar dislocations, congenital hip dislocation or dysplasia, or foot deformities may be presenting features. In older children,
CCD is an important differential diagnosis of progressive thoracolumbar scoliosis. There is also an intrafamilial variability, with some
individuals presenting only with muscle stiffness, exertional myalgia,
or rhabdomyolysis.
Genetic resolution of core myopathies has led to gene variant-­
specific clinical presentations and phenotype-­genotype correlations.

Central Core Disease

Central core disease (CCD) is most commonly associated with RYR1
gene variants, which are described as the predominant genetic causes
of nondystrophic neuromuscular disorders. These disorders range
from dominantly inherited CCD, subgroups of recessively inherited MmD, and CNM (see Chapter 648.1), and CFTD (see Chapter
648.2) to malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) trait. MHS
is a dominantly inherited allelic trait, described as a pharmacogenetic
predisposition to a severe and potentially life-­threatening reaction in
response to halogenated anesthetic agents and depolarizing muscle
relaxants. MHS is suspected in an individual with congenital myopathy
when (1) there is a positive family history of MHS, (2) there have been
previous difficulties with anesthesia, and (3) the patient has a documented RYR1 gene variant.
Dominantly inherited RYR1-­related CCD is characterized by mild
to moderate muscle weakness presenting from infancy to childhood
(Fig. 648.6). The clinical spectrum ranges from fetal akinesia deformation sequence to milder adult forms. The distribution of weakness is
typically proximal, with prominent hip girdle and axial muscle involvement. Congenital hip dislocation, scoliosis, and generalized joint laxity

are common. In contrast to the recessive forms with a more severe
clinical phenotype, there is no extraocular muscle involvement. Bulbar, respiratory, and cardiac involvement is uncommon. Myalgia may
be prominent. Except for patients with a severe neonatal onset, most
patients with CCD achieve independent ambulation. CCD tends to
be stable over long periods, with a possible slowly progressive course
in adulthood. RYR1-­related MHS is allelic to CCD, and some patients
with CCD may also be malignant hyperthermia susceptible. Figure
648.7 shows a family with a recessive RYR1 gene variant in the index
patient and his asymptomatic father who is carrying a dominant RYR1-­
MHS gene. Characteristics and phenotypes due to RYR1 gene variants
are summarized in Table 648.6.
MHS-­related RYR1 gene variants have also been described as a common cause of induced and episodic phenotypes such as exertional
rhabdomyolysis, which account for up to 30% of presentations in otherwise healthy individuals throughout life (see Chapter 647). Late-­onset
presentations in adulthood highlight the relevance of the congenital
myopathies for adult neuromuscular practice. A predisposing genetic
background should be considered if episodes are familial, recurrent,
out of context to the exercise performed, or preceded by other symptoms, such as cramps, myalgia, and weakness. RYR1-­related rhabdomyolysis may occur up to 72 hours after exercise and may mimic viral
myositis; in contrast to other metabolic myopathies, fasting does not
appear to be a triggering factor.
Due to expression of ryanodine receptors other than striated skeletal
muscle, nonskeletal muscle presentations of RYR1-­related myopathies are
recognized. Mild bleeding abnormalities are described in patients with
malignant hyperthermia carrying gain-­of-­function RYR1 gene variants
by altering vascular smooth muscle cell function. A bleeding defect in
the animal model and one patient was reversed by treatment with the
RyR1 antagonist dantrolene, suggesting a therapeutic role for RYR1-­
related bleeding disorders and, potentially, other bleeding disorders,
as well. Another observed phenotype is severe CNS involvement in an
adolescent suffering a malignant hyperthermia episode. Striking similarities in terms of cerebellar involvement seen in this patient and heat
stroke victims indicated a potential link between RYR1-­related exertional rhabdomyolysis and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Some of
the psychopharmacologic drugs, such as olanzapine, should be considered as triggering agents in patients with RYR1 gene variants and exertional rhabdomyolysis. An emerging question is cardiac involvement in
RYR1-­related myopathies. Sudden unexplained death, dilated cardiomyopathy presumed to be due to a viral infection, bicuspid aortic valve,
and sinus bradycardia are described; cardiologic assessment should be
considered to define a cardiac phenotype associated with RYR1-­related
myopathies.

MmD is typically recessively inherited, and the clinical phenotype
depends on the underlying genetic background. Presentations may
vary and overlap between the most common and recognizable classic
form, a severe neonatal form, a form with external ophthalmoplegia,
and a moderate form with hand involvement. The classic phenotype due
to recessive SEPN1 gene variants can be summarized as axial weakness, early spinal rigidity, scoliosis, and respiratory impairment (Fig.
648.8). The onset is early, with predominant involvement of the neck
muscles. Infants unable to hold up their heads, despite being able to
walk independently, can present as having an isolated neck myopathy
or dropped-­head syndrome. A myopathic face, high-­arched or cleft palate, high-­pitched voice, feeding difficulties, and failure to thrive can be
accompanying features. These patients may look very similar to each
other, with an asthenic and atrophic muscle phenotype and growth
retardation, and are mainly investigated and referred with a preliminary diagnosis of celiac disease. The proximal shoulder girdle muscles
and inner thigh are affected more. Axial weakness is replaced with contractures of the spinal extensor muscles in time, leading to a rigid spine
deformity. Usually by the second decade, there is a progressive scoliosis, lateral deviation of the trunk, and respiratory impairment that is
overall in disproportion to the skeletal muscle weakness. MmD should
be considered in the differential diagnosis of diseases presenting with

Disease
EARLY-­ONSET RYR1-­RELATED PHENOTYPES

LATE-­ONSET RYR1-­RELATED PHENOTYPES

Dominant gene variants typically present with congenital hypotonia, weakness, and hip
dislocation at birth.
Motor milestones are delayed; independent ambulation is eventually achieved.
Weakness tends to involve hip girdle and quadriceps with sparing of facial and
extraocular muscles.

Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS)

Recessive gene variants have a tendency of earlier and more severe presentation
compared with most patients with dominant gene variants; however, they are also
associated with a wide range of clinical phenotypes and pathologic features.

Recessive phenotypes can be further grouped as clinical groups with and without
ophthalmoparesis.

Exertional rhabdomyolysis

Dominant and recessive gene variants with a severe neonatal presentation leading to
death are described.

RYR1-­related centronuclear myopathy (CNM) presents with a variable degree of external
ophthalmoparesis, frequently associated with facial weakness.

early neuromuscular chronic respiratory failure (i.e., chronic-­
onset
respiratory muscle weakness while the patient is still ambulant). Respiratory involvement may lead to secondary cardiac failure. Ophthalmoplegia is not a feature of this classic form, but it has exceptionally been
recognized in the last stages of disease in patients with a severe course.
MmD phenotypes due to recessive RYR1 pathologic variants are characterized by a milder respiratory but prominent bulbar impairment
compared with those with the classic form. External ophthalmoplegia,
recurrent episodes of periodic paralysis, distal weakness and wasting
mainly affecting the hands, arthrogryposis, cryptorchidism, and dysmorphic features have also been described in the RYR1-­related MmD
spectrum. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with short-­chain

acyl-­coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency, and primary cardiomyopathies due to gene variants in myosin heavy chain 7 (MYH7) or titin
(TTN) genes, have been described in MmD. Although not reported in
SEPN1-­related MmD, there is a potential risk for MHS in RYR1-­related
MmD.

LABORATORY FINDINGS

The diagnosis of core myopathies may be challenging and requires a
combination of a detailed clinical (phenotype recognition) and laboratory (histopathologic, muscle imaging, genetic) evaluation and
interpretation. The serum CK value is normal, except during crises
of malignant hyperthermia, which can result in rhabdomyolysis or

extensive acute myofiber necrosis (see Chapter 651.2). Muscle imaging (ultrasonography and MRI) may serve as a noninvasive tool to
describe characteristic selective muscle involvement. Recognition of
these patterns may help to distinguish typical dominantly inherited
CCD forms and SEPN1-­related MmD from a variety of neuromuscular
diseases. The diagnosis of a core myopathy based on pathologic findings may be straightforward; however, the typical picture may evolve
over time, with early muscle biopsies showing almost no or minimal
changes. Core formation is a nonspecific finding and may be observed
in the denervation process, tenotomy, metabolic conditions, or even
healthy probands after eccentric exercise. Moth-­eaten fibers described
in muscular dystrophies may resemble minicores in MmD. The presence of cores without associated weakness, as reported in some MHS
individuals, is not sufficient to give a diagnosis of core myopathy. Cores
and other structural abnormalities specific for other structural myopathies, such as nemaline rods or centralized nuclei, can coexist. Muscular dystrophies due to lamin A/C (LMNA) gene variants, collagen
VI–related myopathies, metabolic myopathies (Pompe disease), myofibrillary myopathies in patients with cardiomyopathy, and congenital
myasthenic syndromes may mimic core myopathies based on clinical
and/or pathologic features and should be considered in the differential
diagnosis.
Due to the extreme clinical and pathologic overlaps among the early-­
onset muscle diseases, there has been a shift in the traditional diagnostic
pathways. Taking all of these issues into account, the diagnosis of core
myopathies, like other congenital myopathies, requires a combined effort
on the part of the clinician, pathologist, and molecular geneticist.

GENETICS

Central core myopathies are transmitted as either an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive trait, or de novo dominant gene variants.
They are caused by the same abnormal gene at the 19q13.1 locus. This
gene programs the ryanodine receptor (RYR1), a tetrameric receptor
that contains a non–voltage-­gated calcium channel; it is prevalent in the
sarcoplasmic reticulum and especially at the junction of the T-­tubule
with the cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It contains the channel by which calcium is released among the myofilaments. Gene variants in the RYR1 gene are also the cause of malignant hyperthermia

(MH). In CNMs, autosomal recessive gene variants of RYR1 are known
to be a frequent cause, and a patient with a dominant de novo gene
variant of RYR1 was also described (see Chapter 651.2). Patients presenting with congenital myopathy, ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia,
and prominent internal nuclei in addition to other structural findings
are highly likely candidates for RYR1 gene variants. Recessive core
disease may be associated with tissue-­specific silencing of the normal
allele, an epigenetic phenomenon. Certain missense gene variants can
be associated with autosomal dominant MH, and management of the
asymptomatic carrier of the MHS allele should be treated accordingly.
Gene variants in the slow β-­myosin gene (MYH7), autosomal recessive titin (TTN) gene variants, and recessive gene variants of the satellite cell gene (MEGF10) are other identified causes of core myopathy.
The latter is characterized by early-­onset myopathy, areflexia, respiratory distress, and dysphagia (EMARRD). A single patient has been
described who presented with severe congenital myopathy and ophthalmoplegia and recessive variants in the gene encoding the alpha-­1
subunit of the dihydropyridine receptor (CACNA1S), a gene in which
dominant gene variants are known to be associated with hypokalemic
periodic paralysis and MH. Functional studies are required to link
CACNA1S gene variants to congenital myopathies.
MmD is caused mainly by recessive gene variants in SEPN1 and RYR1.
Selenoprotein N is an integral membrane protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is expressed in several tissues, including the
skeletal muscle, heart, lung, and placenta. It is also highly expressed in
the diaphragm; this could explain the finding of early restrictive respiratory insufficiency in patients. SEPN1 gene variants also cause CFTD (see
Chapter 648.2) and rigid spine muscular dystrophy (see Chapter 649).

TREATMENT AND PROGNOSIS

The treatment for core myopathies is symptomatic and should be, in
general, parallel to consensus standard care guidelines in congenital
myopathies. Orthopedic complications, rehabilitation, and feeding
problems should be managed accordingly. Scoliosis and other skeletal
deformities require special attention because they may develop quickly
and progress in severity disproportionately to the limb weakness. Compared with other congenital myopathies, there are a higher number of
treatment failures in congenital hip dislocation and dysplasia in CCD.

3816 Part XXVI u Neuromuscular Disorders
CCD is consistently associated with MH, which can precede the
diagnosis of CCD. All patients and asymptomatic carriers should be
counseled in terms of a potentially fatal adverse reaction to volatile
anesthetics and muscle relaxants. Preoperative anesthetic consultation in patients known to be subject to general anesthesia should be
considered. Wearing a medical alert bracelet should be advised in
terms of any emergency. Treatment of MH requires dantrolene and
additional supportive care measures. Prophylactic dantrolene is not
recommended before anesthesia even in cases where MHS has been
established.
There may be an insidious onset of respiratory muscle involvement,
particularly in patients with MmD and SEPN1 gene variants. Patients
may be symptomatic after an intercurrent illness or anesthesia or
even sedation at the time of a muscle biopsy procedure. Multidisciplinary care requires input from pulmonologists. Signs and symptoms
of sleep-­disordered breathing, such as nocturnal hypoventilation
syndrome, should be questioned. Respiratory function tests in sitting
and supine positions and polysomnography are necessary to introduce
noninvasive positive-­pressure ventilation in a timely manner. Patients
with severe early-­onset disease may require invasive mechanical ventilation. Cardiac complications are uncommon in CCD, but baseline
electrocardiography and echocardiography studies are appropriate in
most cases. Secondary right ventricular dysfunction and cardiac failure
may complicate the situation in patients with respiratory impairment.
A subjective improvement in muscle strength and functional test
results has been reported in patients with CCD who are taking β2-­
agonists (salbutamol, albuterol). Current and future therapeutic
approaches include (1) modification of RYR1 function, (2) correction
of associated oxidative abnormalities, (3) use of pharmacologic compounds enhancing muscle contractility and/or neuromuscular transmission, and (4) correction of a specific gene defect. N-­acetylcysteine
(NAC), as an antioxidant, may serve as a potential treatment option
for RYR1-­ and SEPN1-­related myopathies, and the first clinical trials in
humans are currently under way.

648.5 Myofibrillar Myopathies
Adnan Y. Manzur
Myofibrillar myopathies (MFMs) are rare, inherited or sporadic,
progressive neuromuscular disorders, diagnosed based on distinct
morphologic features. There is a wide range of clinical and genetic
heterogeneity within MFMs, which are also subgrouped as protein
aggregate myopathies. A variety of phenotypic presentations are
described due to cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle involvement.
Core histopathologic findings can be defined as focal disintegration of
myofibrils predominantly at the Z-­disc level, accumulation of myofibrillar degradation products, and ectopic expression of a large number
of proteins. Myofibril dissolution begins at the Z-­disc, and some sarcomeres of myofibers have disorganization or dissolution of myofibrils
adjacent to other areas of normal sarcomeres within the same fiber.
Abnormal protein aggregations, intense congophilia of many hyaline
structures, internalized nuclei, fiber splitting, vacuoles, corelike lesions,
a mild to severe increase in endomysial collagen, and increased fiber
size variability ranging from very hypotrophic to hypertrophic fibers
are among the common features. These zones are associated with
streaming of the Z-­discs, and there is an expression of a large number
of proteins in the aggregates, including dystrophin, sarcoglycans, ubiquitin, desmin intermediate filaments, αB-­crystallin, and several Z-­disc
proteins such as myotilin and filamin-­C. Mitochondrial dysfunction in
the form of abnormal mitochondrial distribution is a frequent finding.
Although a detailed immunocytochemical and ultrastructural study of
the muscle biopsy tissue is required for the diagnosis and can provide
clues about the underlying causative gene, the final diagnosis of the
MFM subtype depends on molecular genetic testing. Overexpression
or upregulation of normal proteins, such as desmin or αB-­crystallin

in myofibers, may be an additional feature in many other neuromuscular conditions, so MFM should be used when these accumulations
are due to a gene variant in the respective protein. The MFM subtypes
are classified according to the affected protein, such as desminopathy,
αB-­crystallinopathy, or Bag3opathy.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND MFM SUBTYPES
ACCORDING TO GENETIC BACKGROUND

Most MFMs are not symptomatic in childhood, but occasionally older
children and adolescents show early symptoms of nonspecific proximal
and distal weakness. MFMs usually present in mid-­adulthood, with a
slowly progressive weakness involving proximal and distal muscles.
The distal presentation is usually more pronounced than the proximal
weakness. Sensory symptoms, muscle stiffness, aching, and cramps
may be additional symptoms. Affected individuals may show signs of
peripheral neuropathy and overt cardiomyopathy. Autosomal recessive
forms present with an early and more severe course compared with
autosomal dominant forms. There is also a large interfamilial and intrafamilial variability in the clinical expression of the disease. The degree
of involvement and pattern of progression vary between affected
individuals.
MFM subtypes with main clinical features are summarized in Table
648.7. Cardiac involvement can sometimes be the initial and only
symptom, especially in desminopathies. Syncopal episodes, conduction defects (complete atrioventricular block, right bundle branch
block, left anterior hemiblock), rhythm problems (ventricular arrhythmia), cardiomyopathy (dilated, restrictive, hypertrophic), persistent
ductus arteriosus, and congestive heart failure are among the cardiac
presentations. Facial, axial, and neck muscle involvement, bulbar signs,
swallowing and feeding difficulties, rigid spine deformity, early respiratory insufficiency, and early-­onset cataracts can be additional clues for
the diagnosis. Smooth muscle involvement can present in the form of
intestinal malabsorption and pseudoobstruction.
Some MFM subtypes may be associated with early-­infantile onset.
An example is a unique autosomal recessive myopathy in Cree native
infants characterized by severe generalized muscular hypertonia that
is not relieved by neuromuscular blockade; hence, it is myopathic in
origin. Most die in infancy of respiratory insufficiency because of diaphragmatic involvement. The muscle biopsy shows similar findings to
many other MFMs (Fig. 648.9); a novel αB-­crystallin gene variant is
the cause. An early disease onset may also be seen in desminopathy,
Bag3opathy, autosomal recessive epidermolysis bullosa simplex with
muscular dystrophy (EBS-­MD) within the group of plectinopathies,
hereditary myopathy with early respiratory failure (HMERF) within the
group of titinopathies, actin-­related MFM, and PYROXD1-­myopathy.
MFM disease genes encode proteins that are structural and functional components of the sarcomere, extrasarcomeric cytoskeleton,
or protein quality control systems. PYROXD1 is classified as a class
I pyridine nucleotide-­disulfide oxidoreductase, which belongs to an
ancient family of enzymes that regulate the redox state of other proteins. An early-­onset PYROXD1-­myopathy is described, characterized
histologically by multiple internalized nuclei, large zones of sarcomeric
disorganization, accumulation of thin filaments, thickened Z bands,
and desmin-­positive inclusions. There is a distinctive histopathology
that combines features of central and minicore disease and the centronuclear, myofibrillar, and nemaline myopathies in patients described
so far, which clearly indicates the overlap between congenital myopathies and MFMs.
In about half of the affected individuals with MFMs, the genetic defect
remains unknown.

LABORATORY FINDINGS

The diagnosis of MFMs rests on common morphologic features
observed in muscle histologic studies. Immunocytochemical studies
and electron microscopy of muscle can provide clues about the causative gene. Peripheral nerve and myocardial pathologic findings have
been described briefly in a small number of patients with MFMs; testing is not routinely performed on clinical grounds. The serum CK level
can be normal or mildly elevated. Electromyography reveals myopathic

sharp waves, complex repetitive discharges, and myotonic discharges).
Muscle MRI can demonstrate different patterns of involvement according to MFM subtypes. The final diagnosis is based on the combination
of clinical features, muscle biopsy features, and molecular genetic test
results.
Proteomic analysis of protein aggregates yields to identification
of diagnostic biomarkers in different MFM subtypes. The ratio of
filamin C to myotilin in aggregates is described as a highly sensitive
and specific diagnostic marker for myotilinopathy. The combination

of immunofluorescence studies with proteomic findings will further
facilitate identification of several proteins involved in protein quality
control and degradation, which may also act as therapeutic targets.
The differential diagnosis includes congenital myopathies, myotonic
dystrophy, mitochondrial diseases, and peripheral neuropathies in
childhood.

TREATMENT

There is no curative treatment available for MFMs. Treatment is supportive and symptomatic. Cardiac screening (electrocardiography,

648.6 Brain Malformations and Muscle
Development
Adnan Y. Manzur
Infants with cerebellar hypoplasia are hypotonic and developmentally
delayed, especially in gross motor skills. Muscle biopsy is sometimes
performed to exclude a congenital myopathy. A biopsy specimen
can show delayed maturation of muscle, fiber-­type predominance, or
CMFTD. Other malformations of the brain may also be associated with
abnormal histochemical patterns, but supratentorial lesions are less
likely than brainstem or cerebellar lesions to alter muscle development.
Abnormal descending impulses along bulbospinal pathways probably
alter discharge patterns of lower motor neurons that determine the histochemical differentiation of muscle at 20-­28 weeks of gestation. The
corticospinal tract does not participate because it is not yet functional
during this period of fetal life.
There are a variety of muscular dystrophies associated with cerebral and ocular phenotypes, suggesting common mechanisms affecting
development of the muscle, the brain, and the eye. It is clear that in at
least some of these cases, the abnormal protein implicated in pathogenesis is expressed in the muscle, brain, and eye, and is important for
the stabilization of muscle, migration of central neurons, and normal
tissue development in the eye.
Alpha dystroglycan–related dystrophies (αDG-­RD) are a group
of muscle diseases with a broad phenotypic and genetic spectrum,

Cytoskeleton
F-actin

Fig. 648.10 Schematic drawing of dystrophin-­glycoprotein complex

(DGC) and glycosylated α-­dystroglycan (DG). α-­DG links extracellular
components such as laminin, and links β-­DG, a transmembrane glycoprotein. Via dystrophin it binds to actin cytoskeleton. α-­DG is heavily
glycosylated, and its glycans play a role in binding to laminin. (From
Taniguchi-­Ikeda M, Morioka I, Iijima K, et al. Mechanistic aspects of the
formation of α-­dystroglycan and therapeutic research for the treatment
of α-­dystroglycanopathy: A review. Mol Aspects Med. 2016;51:115–124.)

including several congenital muscular dystrophies (see Chapter 649.6),
with severe brain involvement in the form of cobblestone lissencephaly
(Walker-­Warburg syndrome, Fukuyama disease, and muscle-­eye-­brain
disease of Santavuori) to the LGMD spectrum (see Chapter 649.4).
The dystrophin-­glycoprotein complex forms a critical link between
the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton, and in the muscle tissue, stabilizes the muscle membrane. Dystroglycans simply interact with proteins in the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton via dystrophin (Fig.
648.10). αDG is a transmembrane glycoprotein, and extensive posttranslational glycosylation (O-­linked mannosylation) is required for its
proper function, to mediate binding to basement membrane proteins
(laminin alpha-­2 chain, perlecan, agrin), neurexin in the brain, pikachurin in the eye, and Slit (by interaction with laminin globular [G]
domains).
Defects of O-­glycosylation of αDG are considered to be central to
the pathogenesis of αDG-­RD. Deletion of dystroglycan or its glycosyltransferases results in migration defects in the form of type II cobblestone lissencephaly and a variety of eye malformations affecting both
the retina and anterior chamber, such as glaucoma and cataracts.
Dystroglycan is required not only for the integrity of basement
membranes along which developing axonal pathways extend, but also
because it directly binds to the laminin G domain of Slit, organizing
Slit distribution in vivo. It maintains a growth environment and functions as an extracellular scaffold that controls axon guidance events by
organizing the availability of axonal growth and guidance cues at critical intermediate targets. Misregulation of Slit-­Robo signaling involved
in axonal guidance and neuronal connectivity is reflected to patients
with αDG-­RD.
Clinical classification is difficult because there are patients with
milder abnormalities, such as microcephaly, cerebellar hypoplasia with
or without cysts, learning disabilities with normal neuroimaging features and CMD or LGMD phenotype, and with normal cognitive function. Neuroimaging signatures on brain MRI can be summarized as
cobblestone complex (type II cobblestone lissencephaly to focal pachygyria or polymicrogyria), midbrain hypoplasia, relatively thick tectum,
fused colliculi, ventral pontine cleft, pontomesencephalic kink, abnormalities of cerebellar foliation, cerebellar cysts, hydrocephalus, occipital
encephalocele, and patchy and confluent involvement of white matter

with a high signal intensity on T2 weighted and fluid-­attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images (Fig. 648.11). A high serum CK level
in the presence of the previously mentioned imaging features simply
differentiates a muscle disorder from other genetic causes of cortical
malformations of development. A reduction or absence of immunolabeling with antibodies, which recognize glycosylated epitopes of αDG
in muscle biopsy, is a pathologic signature for αDG-­RD.
There is an ever-­expanding list of genes involved in αDG-­RD. Gene
variants in up to 19 glycosyltransferases and accessory proteins have
been found to be involved in the glycosylation of αDG (DAG1, POMT1,
POMT2, POMGnT1, POMGnT2, LARGE, FKRP, FKTN, ISPD, GTDC2,
B3GNT1, B3GALNT2, GMPPB, TMEM5, SGK196, DPM1, DPM2,
DPM3, DOLK); the availability of targeted gene panels and NGS techniques increases the diagnostic yield in this spectrum.
Congenital disorders of glycosylation, involving both N-­ and O-­
glycosylation (gene variants in DPM1, DPM2, and DPM3), overlap
with αDG-­RD, and may present with high serum CK levels, cognitive
impairment, microcephaly, feeding difficulties, myoclonic epilepsy,
and cerebellar hypoplasia.
Another example is a CMD form overlapping with Marinesco-­
Sjögren syndrome (MSS) and dystroglycanopathy due to INPP5K
gene variants, in patients with short stature, intellectual disability, and
cataracts, described as a continuum of αDG-­RD. INPP5K encodes
inositol polyphosphate-­5-­phosphatase K, which has been shown to
regulate myoblast differentiation and protein processing through its
interaction with the endoplasmic reticulum chaperones.
Genes identified so far, functioning in the endoplasmic reticulum
and/or Golgi apparatus, point to a common mechanism involving an
interaction between the cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix
in terms of brain malformations and muscle development.

648.7 Amyoplasia
Adnan Y. Manzur
Congenital absence of individual muscles is common and is often
asymmetric. A common aplasia is the palmaris longus muscle of the

ventral forearm, which is absent in 30% of normal subjects and is
fully compensated for by other flexors of the wrist. Unilateral absence
of a sternocleidomastoid muscle is one cause of congenital torticollis.
Absence of one pectoralis major muscle is part of the Poland anomalad.
When innervation does not develop, as in the lower limbs in severe
cases of myelomeningocele, muscles can fail to develop. In sacral agenesis, the abnormal somites that fail to form bony vertebrae can also fail
to form muscles from the same defective mesodermal plate, a disorder
of induction resulting in segmental amyoplasia. Skeletal muscles of the
extremities fail to differentiate from embryonic myomeres if the long
bones do not form. The absence of one long bone, such as the radius,
is associated with variable aplasia or hypoplasia of associated muscles,
such as the flexor carpi radialis. End-­stage neurogenic atrophy of muscle
is sometimes called amyoplasia, but this use is semantically incorrect.
Generalized amyoplasia usually results in fetal death, and live-­born
neonates rarely survive. A pathogenic variant in one of the myogenic
genes is the suspected etiology because of genetic knockout studies in
mice, but it has not been proven in humans. An estimated 400 discrete
diagnoses can lead to congenital arthrogryposis. The two largest categories are amyoplasia and distal arthrogryposis, which combined make
up 50–65% of all diagnoses within the arthrogryposis subset. Amyoplasia, the most common, is not clearly an inherited genetic syndrome
of characteristic upper and lower limb contractures. Distal arthrogryposes, by contrast, have an underlying genetic abnormality, which in
many cases seems to target the fast-­twitch muscles of the developing
fetus.

Syndrome Myopathy)
Adnan Y. Manzur
Proteus syndrome is a disturbance of cellular growth involving ectodermal and mesodermal tissues, representing a cellular mosaicism. The
genetic defect is a variant in the AKT1 gene, of the same genetic family
as AKT3, which causes hemimegalencephaly; indeed, many children
with Proteus syndrome also have hemimegalencephaly as another tissue overgrowth, not a separate association. These genes participate in

the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Proteus syndrome also manifests as asymmetric overgrowth of the extremities,
verrucous cutaneous lesions, angiomas of various types, thickening
of bones, and excessive growth of muscles without weakness. Severe
seizures, beginning in neonates, are uncommon. Histologically, the
muscle demonstrates a unique muscular dysgenesis. Abnormal zones
are adjacent to zones of normal muscle formation and do not follow
anatomic boundaries.
Proteus syndrome is recognized as a phenotypical variety of the
epidermal nevus syndrome, together with linear sebaceous nevus of
Jadassohn, CLOVES syndrome, and others, as a postzygotic somatic
mosaicism.

648.9 Benign Congenital Hypotonia
Adnan Y. Manzur
Benign congenital hypotonia is not a disease, but it is a descriptive term for infants or children with nonprogressive hypotonia of
unknown origin. The hypotonia is not usually associated with weakness or developmental delay, although some children acquire gross
motor skills more slowly than normal. Tendon stretch reflexes are
normal or hypoactive. There are no cranial nerve abnormalities, and
intelligence is normal.
The diagnosis is one of exclusion (see Table 647.2 in Chapter 647)
after results of laboratory studies, including muscle biopsy and imaging of the brain with special attention to the cerebellum, are normal.
Muscle biopsy is deferred in some mild cases to follow the clinical
evolution over time, but the diagnosis in these infants is more provisional. No known molecular genetic basis for this syndrome has been
identified in the majority, but a rare form with an RYR1 variant and
MH is recognized. Table 647.3 in Chapter 647 lists the differential
diagnoses.
The prognosis is generally good; no specific therapy is required.
Contractures do not develop. Physical therapy might help achieve
motor milestones (walking) sooner than expected. Hypotonia persists
into adult life. The disorder is not always as benign as its name implies
because a common complication is recurrent dislocation of joints,
especially the shoulders. Excessive motility of the spine can result in
stretch injury, compression, or vascular compromise of nerve roots or
of the spinal cord. These are particular hazards for patients who perform gymnastics or who become circus performers because of agility
of joints without weakness or pain.

648.10 Arthrogryposis
Adnan Y. Manzur
See also Chapter 723.
Arthrogryposis (arthro, joint; gryp, curved), arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (multiplex, multiple; congenita, present at birth), and
multiple congenital contractures are descriptive terms, used interchangeably to define contractures in two or more different body parts
(Table 648.8). Arthrogryposis is a sign rather than a diagnosis; anything that interferes or limits normal fetal movement can lead to congenital contractures. The contractures usually (1) involve the limbs, but
also may include the jaw, neck, and spine; (2) are nonprogressive in
nature; and (3) improve over time with early physiotherapy and orthopedic interventions.
Although each specific type is rare, the incidence of arthrogryposis
is described as 1 in 3,000-­5,000 live births, according to population-­
based studies.

FETAL MOVEMENT AND THE LINK TO
ARTHROGRYPOSIS

The main background factor in all forms of arthrogryposis is decreased
or lack of fetal movement (fetal akinesia/hypokinesia), and the clinical
severity is directly correlated with the onset. An early onset and long
duration of decreased movements lead to a more severe phenotype at
birth. The first trimester is a critical period in terms of progressive motor
development. There is an evolution of the movement pattern; early fetal
activity is believed to be generated by central pattern networks in the spinal cord and mediated by feedback from the immature muscle fibers of
myotomes, shifting to a more specific pattern due to the development of
the supraspinal parts of the brain. The development of joints, joint spaces,
and movements start at 5½, 7, and 8 embryonic weeks, respectively.
Therefore decreased fetal movement beyond 10 weeks is a sign of maldevelopment and/or dysfunction of the early fetal central or peripheral
nervous system. General movements with relatively simple and stereotypical sideways bending of the head and trunk can be noticed as early as
7 weeks of gestation (embryonal, 5 weeks). They develop in a craniocaudal and proximal-­to-­distal direction, with a propagation from the shoulders and hips first, to the upper and, then, lower limbs (7-­9 weeks). At
this time point, jaw opening also begins. Isolated arm and leg movements
can be visible from 8-­9 weeks to 10 weeks, respectively. By 11 weeks of
gestation, a full range of limb movements (extension, flexion, rotation,
abduction, and adduction of each limb) develops. Developmentally,
fetal sucking and swallowing are described in the early second trimester.
Fetal breathing movements begin around 12-­14 weeks, and by 20 weeks
they become more regular. Facial movements are recognized in the late
second trimester, and between 24 and 35 weeks show a developmental
progression from unrelated facial movements toward fetal facial gestalts.

TERM

DESCRIPTION/DEFINITION

Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC)

AMC is a term used to describe a group of congenital conditions characterized by joint contractures
in two or more body areas.

Amyoplasia (classical arthrogryposis)

Amyoplasia is characterized by multiple congenital contractures presenting in a very specific
pattern. It is typically symmetric, involving all four limbs, with internally rotated shoulders, fully
extended and fixed elbows, the wrists fixed in flexion, partially flexed fingers, hips fixed in flexion
or extension, adducted or abducted, and sometimes dislocated. The knees may be fixed in
extension or flexion, and the feet are usually in severe equinovarus position. The jaw and trunk are
relatively spared. Normal limb muscle tissue is replaced by fatty, fibrous tissue.

Distal arthrogryposis (DA)

DA is a group of rare arthrogryposis syndromes characterized by congenital contractures of two
or more areas of the body, primarily involving the hands and feet, while the proximal joints
are largely spared, in the absence of primary neurologic and/or muscle disease affecting limb
function. Diagnostic features include camptodactyly or pseudocamptodactyly, hypoplastic
or absent flexion creases, overriding fingers, ulnar deviation at the wrist, talipes equinovarus,
calcaneovalgus deformities, vertical talus, and/or metatarsus varus.

Chapter 648 u Developmental Disorders of Muscle
Contracting musculature is the main role player in maintaining joint
progenitor cells committed to their fate, and for correct joint cavitation and formation. A key modulator of joint formation, beta-­catenin,
is activated in a contraction-­dependent manner. Further, a reduced
muscle phenotype also has a differential effect on ossification centers,
with significant decreases in bone formation. Muscle development,
early spontaneous contraction, innervation, and joint and bone formation seem to be complex interdependent developmental processes that
finally allow normal limb movement and maintenance. Although not
investigated in detail, normal fetal breathing and/or swallowing and
lung and gastrointestinal maturation may be affected through the same
developmental processes.
Decreased movement is associated with a compensatory connective
tissue response, collagenosis (an increase of connective tissue around
the joints), which limits the joint movements and increases contractures. Any effort to mobilize the joints may lead to minor fractures of
abnormal joint surfaces. Diaphragmatic and intercostal muscle dysfunction further results in loss of rhythmic thoracic movements and
leads to a small thoracic cage and failure of maturation of the alveoli
and surfactant, leading to pulmonary hypoplasia. By 15 weeks of gestation, development of the lung is arrested at the canalicular phase,
which is also a critical point for joint development. Lack of muscle pull
at sites of normal attachment may lead to craniofacial abnormalities,
with facial weakness leading to a tented upper lip appearance.
Pathologic changes with an onset during intrauterine development
are confined to primary alterations in anterior horn cells, roots, peripheral nerves, motor end plates, or muscles. Spinal cord involvement,
with abnormal histology and unequal distribution of alpha motor neurons in anterior horn cells, is described in infants with the neurogenic
forms of arthrogryposis.

BASIC CATEGORIES, ETIOLOGIES, AND
CLASSIFICATIONS

Decreased or lack of in utero movements are all reflected in the clinical features of the lethal forms of lower motor neuron diseases and
the fetal akinesia/hypokinesia deformation sequence (FADS), Pena-­
Shokeir phenotype, which represents the severe end of the arthrogryposis spectrum. This phenotype can be described as intrauterine
growth restriction, multiple joint contractures, shortened limbs, craniofacial changes (micrognathia, cleft palate, high nasal root, ocular
hypertelorism), pulmonary hypoplasia, polyhydramnios, decreased
gut motility, a shortened gut, a short umbilical cord, skin changes, and
short limbs. Iatrogenic fractures due to osteoporosis of long bones in
the prenatal period can be an additional feature. They may be isolated
or associated with additional organ system abnormalities.
Lower motor neuron diseases, characterized by degeneration of
anterior horn cells of the spinal cord and descending tracts, may overlap with arthrogryposis and FADS. The prototype in childhood is SMA
(see Chapters 652.2 and 652.3).
Lethal congenital contracture syndrome (LCCS) and lethal
arthrogryposis with anterior horn cell disease (LAAHD) are two
independent neurogenic arthrogryposis subtypes, with a remarkable
phenotypic overlap and ever-­expanding heterogeneity at the phenotypic and molecular genetic levels.
Amyoplasia and distal arthrogryposis (DA) are the two most
common categories of conditions, accounting for up to 50–65% of the
patients presenting with arthrogryposis.
The most common type is Amyoplasia (A, no; myo, muscle; and
plasia, growth); it is also called classic arthrogryposis. Amyoplasia is a
sporadic condition in which limb muscle tissue is replaced by fatty tissue. Despite extensive genetic studies, no chromosomal or single gene
etiology has been identified to date. Amyoplasia (with a capital A), is a
diagnosis of exclusion, so it should be distinguished from other genetic
forms of arthrogryposis presenting with decreased or absent muscle
mass. The natural course, management, and genetic counseling depend
on a correct diagnosis. The incidence of Amyoplasia is 1/10,000 live
births. Discordant monozygotic twinning is described, that is, at least
6.6% of the affected individuals are described to have an unaffected
monozygotic twin.

Fig. 648.12 Typical appearance of a patient with amyoplasia with

internal rotation of the shoulders, fixed extension of the elbows,
clenched wrist (A), hip dysplasia, and equinovarus deformity (B).

The diagnosis should be considered in the presence of symmetric
congenital, rigid contractures with a characteristic position of limbs in
the newborn period (internal rotation of the shoulders, fixed extension
of the elbows, pronation of the forearm, flexion of the wrist, camptodactyly, and severe equinovarus deformity of the feet; Fig. 648.12),
accompanied by shortness of the affected limbs; a marked decrease in
limb muscle mass; lack of flexion creases on limbs, fingers, and hands;
mild intrauterine growth retardation; dimples overlying affected joints;
spared trunk; nevus flammeus over the craniofacial midline; bone fractures; osteoporosis of the long bones; normal CNS function; and a negative family history. There may be spinal involvement. Muscle defects
in the abdominal wall, inguinal hernias, bowel atresia, absence of trunk
muscles, digit compromise, or constriction bands of the limbs or digits can accompany the clinical picture due to vascular compromise.
There is a range of severity, from very mild to severe involvement, with
almost 15% of patients presenting with a pure, isolated upper extremity
or lower extremity involvement. The diagnosis of these forms requires
experience and evaluation of a differential diagnostic list. Contractures
usually improve over time with early physiotherapy and orthopedic
care (see Chapter 723), with almost 85% of affected individuals being
ambulatory by age 5 years and two thirds being able to live independent lives.
Distal arthrogryposis (DA) is a heterogeneous group with a wide
phenotypic variability, primarily involving the hands and feet, with
sparing of the proximal joints. The prevalence is not known. It is often
associated with abnormal facies and autosomal dominant inheritance,
but autosomal recessive and sporadic patients are also described.
Patients usually present in an orthopedic environment. There is an
expanded classification with 11 different syndromes (see Chapter 723,
Table 723.2). Abnormalities of fast-­twitch muscles are identified in a
majority of patients with DA. Gene variants in sarcomeric muscle proteins (troponin, tropomyosin, and myosin) can cause DA or congenital
myopathies. Other than this clinical overlap due to a particular gene
variant, a particular phenotype may be associated with variants in different genes. Some of the DA forms prove that embryonic expression
of some of the genes during fetal life, such as MYH3, affects sarcomeric
proteins and the force generation in muscle cells. Dominant and recessive gene variants related to mechanotransduction are identified in the
DA group.
Among over 400 conditions described within this complex category
(including syndromes, gene variants, chromosomal abnormalities,
deletions, and duplications), over 320 genes have been implicated, and
a responsible gene has been identified in more than 150 of the conditions (Fig. 648.13). Considering this extreme clinical and genetic
heterogeneity, it is suggested that classifications can be done at different levels, depending on the area of involvement, overall cause of fetal

Fig. 648.13 Clinical classification of AMC. Clinical classification routinely used at the University Hospital Grenoble Alpes. It aims at distinguishing

straight away the two main causes of AMC: Amyoplasia (Group 1) and DA (Group 2). Details on clinical criteria used to classify these patients into

akinesia/hypokinesia, and etiologic process underlying the developmental dysfunction, or taking into consideration the cardinal features, as in
the case of amyoplasia and DA (Table 648.9). With the utility of NGS
technologies, the field of arthrogryposis is moving to gene-­based classification systems and grouping conditions according to affected or associated gene products and involved developmental pathways.
The etiology can be based on abnormalities of the CNS, nerve,
muscle, and connective tissue; lack of space; maternal illness; environmental agents; or vascular compromise. They may result in decreased
intrauterine movements. As an alternative approach, genetic, sporadic
(amyoplasia), and environmental backgrounds or neurogenic, myopathic, syndromic, and metabolic categories can be used to review possible etiologies.
For practical purposes, the clinical classification is often based on
the presence and absence of additional organ system abnormalities
or malformations and the presence or absence of CNS involvement,
including intellectual disability, and lethality. Of the children with
arthrogryposis, ∼30% will primarily have limb involvement, ∼30% will
have affected limbs plus other body areas but normal cognitive function, and ∼30% will have CNS dysfunction.

DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH AND LABORATORY
EVALUATION

In such a diverse group of disorders with extreme heterogeneity at the
etiologic, phenotypic, and molecular genetic levels, establishing a specific diagnosis is important. The natural history, evolution, prognosis,
therapeutic interventions, and genetic counseling/prenatal diagnosis
depend on a precise diagnosis.

The first step in the diagnostic approach is detailed history taking,
including information about the pregnancy, delivery, and family history, with at least a three-­generation pedigree analysis (Table 648.10).
The maternal perception of intrauterine movements, any difference
compared with previous pregnancies, polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios, intrauterine infections, toxic exposures, maternal illness, maternal and paternal age, breech presentation, type of delivery, and any
event complicating the delivery should be reviewed. Newborns with
arthrogryposis are prone to hypoxic-­ischemic insults.
There is not a standard set of laboratory investigations that can serve
as a diagnostic tool (Table 648.11). Radiologic tests (brain and muscle
MRIs), electrophysiologic tests (electromyography, nerve conduction
velocities), muscle biopsy, chromosomal microarray analysis (array
comparative genomic hybridization [CGH]), and molecular genetic
tests must be individualized for each patient. Input from a clinical
geneticist and experienced multidisciplinary team is invaluable. Documentation of the range of motion, distribution of contractures, muscle
tone and strength, and facial involvement with serial photographs and/
or videos should be a part of follow-­up visits. There is no laboratory
test that can substitute for experience in making the clinical judgment.
In the case of a recognized phenotype, molecular tests can be
directed toward the working diagnosis. Depending on the availability of NGS technologies, the traditional diagnostic trend has shifted
to a diagnosis by genetic sequencing. Disease-­specific targeted gene
panels can serve a diagnostic purpose, because other than a variety
of early-­onset muscle diseases, mitochondrial and metabolic diseases
are covered, as well. In a large cohort of patients presenting with fetal
akinesia/hypokinesia, arthrogryposis, or severe congenital myopathies,

the use of NGS provided a conclusive diagnosis in 18 of 38 families
(47%). Diagnostic yields range between 20% and 60%, depending on
the homogeneity of the patient population; however, despite all efforts,
nearly 50% of patients with arthrogryposis of a genetic origin do not
have a precise molecular diagnosis.
Autopsy evaluation is extremely valuable. It should include an
extensive workup for visceral anomalies, malformations of cortical
development, and the number of anterior horn cells and their size
in the spinal cord, with special attention paid to patchy involvement
and the presence or absence of tracts at various levels in the spinal
cord. Evaluation of the peripheral nerve, eye, and muscle tissue from
different muscle groups and the diaphragm is also needed. Tendon
attachments, fibrous bands replacing muscle, and cartilaginous or
bony fusions can be evaluated, in addition to the presence of other
malformations, deformations, or disruptions. Microarray analysis
from different tissues and DNA extraction and molecular testing are
also possible.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

There is an ever-­expanding list of disorders presenting with arthrogryposis. Almost 50% of fetal akinesia/hypokinesia presentations are neuromuscular in origin, involving all points along the neuromuscular axis
(motor neurons, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junctions, and the

skeletal muscle regulatory and contractile apparatus). Mechanosensitive ion channels are another area of interest.
On clinical grounds, from a neuromuscular standpoint, one can recognize severe spinal muscular atrophies (SMA type 0), atypical SMA
forms with arthrogryposis and bone fractures (see Chapter 652.2),
lower motor neuron diseases (see Chapter 652.3), CMDs with specific attempts to recognize early sclerotic forms of the Ullrich CMD
phenotype (Fig. 648.14) (see Chapter 649.6), and CMD with CNS
involvement-­
alpha dystroglycan–related CMD (Fig. 648.15) (see
Chapter 648.6). In any infant with contractures and/or facial weakness
with a tented upper lip, examination of the mother should be routinely
performed for myotonic reactions as a first step for CMD (Fig. 648.16
and Video 648.1) (see also Chapter 649.3). With the same clinical presentation, if the myotonic reaction of the mother is negative, congenital myopathies (Fig. 648.17 and Video 648.2) (see also Chapter 648.3)
should be included in the differential diagnosis. Fetal acetylcholine
receptor inactivation syndrome is characterized by clinical features
ranging from mild facial and bulbar myopathy to arthrogryposis, and
maternal treatment can improve the outcome (see Chapter 652.1).
Some pterygium syndromes may respond to acetylcholine treatment.
Prevention or treatment of metabolic disturbances (metabolic
acidosis) or treating an inherited metabolic disease may also have a
positive impact on the outcome. Carbohydrate-­deficient glycoprotein

GENETIC COUNSELING AND PRENATAL
DIAGNOSIS

Establishing a molecular diagnosis in an index patient with a genetic
form of arthrogryposis is required for appropriate genetic counseling
and prenatal diagnosis. Despite maternal care and the availability of
prenatal ultrasonography (US), which can confirm abnormal movements and postural findings as early as 11 weeks, 75% of affected
individuals with arthrogryposis were reported to be not diagnosed
before birth. Real-­time US can visualize contractures, the quality of
in utero movements, the joint positioning, lung hypoplasia, nuchal
edema, the muscle mass, and the bone growth in the first or early
second trimester. Prenatal or postnatal MR findings can be used as a
complementary adjunct to US, especially for the evaluation of accompanying muscle and joint malformations. The maternal perception of
decreased intrauterine movements and high-­risk pregnancies should
be carefully evaluated. In an effort to improve the detection rate and

choices, in utero stimulation, or early delivery according to the degree

US study, physicians involved in the care of a pregnant woman should
examine her to rule out myotonic dystrophy, in order to prevent serious complications. Due to high rates of infertility, before introducing
artificial reproductive techniques, myotonic dystrophy should be considered. Because of genetic anticipation, the diagnosis of the mother

may be delayed to the time of giving birth to a severely affected infant
with arthrogryposis (see Chapter 649.3). Arthrogryposis with a history
of myasthenia gravis in the mother should be evaluated accordingly,
because miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death can complicate the
picture (see Chapter 652.1).

Chromosomal abnormalities and autosomal recessive, autosomal
dominant, X-­

described in the disorders related to arthrogryposis, and genetic counseling should be provided accordingly. If a specific diagnosis is not
made, the empirical recurrence risk is defined as 3%, and it is slightly
higher (7%) for arthrogryposis plus CNS involvement.

MANAGEMENT

Each affected individual with arthrogryposis is unique, and the natural
course of the condition depends on the underlying etiology and management. A multidisciplinary team approach (pediatricians, pediatric
orthopedic specialists, plastic or hand surgeons, rehabilitation physicians, occupational therapists, physical therapists, medical geneticists,
neurologists) is essential in standard care (see Chapter 723). Management is shifting to a multidisciplinary clinic that provides patient-­
centered, comprehensive care in a coordinated manner.
In terms of amyoplasia, follow-­up is required to identify treatment
outcomes such as the development of degenerative arthritis, the need
for orthotics for ambulation, or the possibility of becoming overweight
in adulthood. Cytokines and other factors released in response to early
therapeutic interventions are suggested to facilitate the elongation of
pathologic periarticular soft tissues and increase joint motion. The
core principle of management in DA is to preserve muscle function.
Anesthesia-­related complications due to limited jaw opening, restrictive pulmonary function, and the risk of MH should be considered in
the setting of multiple surgeries.

Muscular Dystrophies
Adnan Y. Manzur*
A muscular dystrophy is distinguished from all other neuromuscular diseases by four obligatory criteria: it is a primary myopathy, it
has a genetic basis, the course is progressive, and degeneration and
death of muscle fibers occur at some stage in the disease. This definition excludes neurogenic diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy,
nonhereditary myopathies such as dermatomyositis, nonprogressive
and nonnecrotizing congenital myopathies such as congenital muscle
fiber–type disproportion, and nonprogressive inherited metabolic
myopathies. Some metabolic myopathies can fulfill the definition of a
progressive muscular dystrophy but are not traditionally classified as
dystrophies (muscle carnitine deficiency).
Many muscular dystrophies might eventually be reclassified as
metabolic myopathies once the biochemical defects are better defined.
Muscular dystrophies are a group of unrelated diseases, each transmitted by a different genetic trait and each differing in its clinical course
and expression (Table 649.1). Identifiable pathogenic variants in some
genes may lead to a spectrum of clinical phenotypes, ranging in age
of onset, severity, and presence of comorbidities. Some muscular dystrophies are more severe and/or may be present at birth or soon after
birth, typically defined as congenital muscular dystrophies (Table 649.2),
whereas others may have an onset in childhood or even in adulthood.
There is a range of severity from those that lead to death in the neonatal
period to those that progress gradually over decades, generally with a
normal lifespan. Some categories of dystrophies, such as limb-­girdle

muscular dystrophy (LGMD), are not homogeneous diseases but
rather syndromes encompassing several distinct clinical entities and a
number of putative genes.

649.1 Duchenne and Becker Muscular
Dystrophies
Adnan Y. Manzur
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common hereditary neuromuscular disease affecting all races and ethnic groups. Its
characteristic clinical features are progressive weakness, intellectual
impairment, and hypertrophy of the calves, with proliferation of connective tissue and progressive fibrosis in muscle. The incidence is 1 in
3,600 liveborn infant males. This disease is inherited as an X-­linked
recessive trait. The abnormal gene is at the Xp21 locus and is one of the
largest genes. Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is a disease that is
fundamentally similar to DMD, with a genetic defect at the same locus,
but clinically it follows a milder and more protracted course.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Infant boys with DMD are rarely symptomatic at birth or in early
infancy, although some are mildly hypotonic. Early gross motor skills,
such as rolling over, sitting, and standing, are usually achieved at the
appropriate ages, or may be mildly delayed. Distinctive facies are not
an early feature because facial muscle weakness is a late event; in later
childhood, a “transverse” or horizontal smile may be seen. Walking
is often delayed past 18 months in approximately 50%, and hip girdle
weakness may be seen in a subtle form as early as the second year.
Toddlers might assume a lordotic posture when standing to compensate for gluteal weakness. An early Gowers sign may be seen by age 3
years, but nearly always is evident by age 5 or 6 years (see Fig. 630.5 in
Chapter 630). A Trendelenburg (waddling) gait frequently appears at
this time as well. Common presentations in toddlers include delayed
walking, frequent falling, toe walking, and trouble running or walking
upstairs, developmental delay, and, less often, malignant hyperthermia
after anesthesia. A significant minority present with speech or global
developmental delay and autistic spectrum traits. Some asymptomatic
infants come to attention because of isolated transaminases aspartate
transaminase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT) elevation, which
originates from muscles secondary to sarcolemmal damage, and it is
important to perform serum creatinine kinase (CK), which is found to
be massively elevated. Non-­recognition of this feature leads to hepatology workup and sometimes, an unnecessary muscle biopsy.
The length of time a patient with DMD remains ambulatory varies
greatly. Patients may demonstrate increased difficulties with ambulation, due to the proximal lower extremity weakness, that is further confounded by progressive ankle contractures and toe walking. The age of
complete loss of ambulation ranges typically from about 10-­14 years.
The age at which loss of independent ambulation occurs has increased
over time with the advent of clinical care guidelines recommending
the use of corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone or deflazacort) in boys with
DMD (see the section “Treatment”). With orthotic bracing, physiotherapy, and sometimes minor surgery (Achilles tendon lengthening),
most are able to walk until age 12 years. Maintenance of ambulation is
not only important for preservation of autonomy in activities of daily
living (which has psychosocial benefits for the patient and his family),
but also provides additional benefits in slowing the progression of scoliosis (that typically worsens after loss of ambulation) and in maintenance of pulmonary health.
The relentless progression of weakness continues into the second
decade. The function of distal muscles is usually relatively well enough
preserved, allowing the child to continue to use eating utensils, a pencil, and a computer keyboard. As the disease progresses in the teenage
years, the upper extremity strength declines further, and patients may
have increased difficulties bringing hands to mouth independently,
have fatigue with writing, and have worsening contractures, including
in the hands and fingers. Respiratory muscle involvement frequently

but also provides additional benefits in slowing the progression of scoliosis (that typically worsens after loss of ambulation) and in maintenance of pulmonary health.
The relentless progression of weakness continues into the second
decade. The function of distal muscles is usually relatively well enough
preserved, allowing the child to continue to use eating utensils, a pencil, and a computer keyboard. As the disease progresses in the teenage
years, the upper extremity strength declines further, and patients may
have increased difficulties bringing hands to mouth independently,
have fatigue with writing, and have worsening contractures, including
in the hands and fingers. Respiratory muscle involvement frequently

manifests as a weak and ineffective cough, frequent pulmonary infections, and decreasing respiratory reserve. Early pulmonary symptoms
often include snoring and sleep apnea. Parents or patients may report
an increased frequency of headaches, difficulty awakening in the
mornings, and increased daytime fatigue as signs of sleep-­disordered
breathing. Pharyngeal weakness can lead to episodes of aspiration,
nasal regurgitation of liquids, and an airy or nasal voice quality. The
function of the extraocular muscles remains well preserved. Incontinence due to anal and urethral sphincter weakness is an uncommon
and very late event.
Contractures most often involve the ankles, knees, hips, and elbows.
As upper extremity weakness progresses, contractures are also seen in
neck lateral rotation, shoulders, and fingers. Scoliosis is common in
patients with DMD. The thoracic deformity further compromises the
pulmonary capacity and compresses the heart. It may also lead to more
discomfort, and if severe enough, risk for hip dislocation. Scoliosis usually progresses more rapidly after the child becomes nonambulatory.
However, in the era of corticosteroid use, there may be a further protective effect on the development of and rate of progression of scoliosis.
Enlargement of the calves (pseudohypertrophy) and wasting of thigh
muscles are classic features. The enlargement is caused by hypertrophy
of some muscle fibers, infiltration of muscle by fat, and proliferation
of collagen. After the calves, the next most common site of muscular
hypertrophy is the tongue, followed by muscles of the forearm. Abnormalities of the muscle are demonstrated using muscle MRI techniques
to assess signal, water content, fat fractions, and even MR spectroscopy
profiles (Fig. 649.1). Fasciculations of the tongue do not occur. The voluntary sphincter muscles rarely become involved.
Unless ankle contractures are severe, ankle deep tendon reflexes
remain preserved until terminal stages. The knee deep tendon
reflexes may be present until about 6 years of age but are less brisk
than the ankle jerks and are eventually lost with the progression of
weakness.
Cardiomyopathy, including persistent tachycardia and myocardial fibrosis, occurs in a majority of patients with DMD. The
severity of cardiac involvement does not necessarily correlate with
the degree of skeletal muscle weakness. In patients with DMD, the

progression of cardiomyopathy typically occurs after loss of independent ambulation. However, in patients with BMD, patients may
develop worsening of cardiomyopathy and even develop severe
heart failure despite still being ambulant. Smooth muscle dysfunction, particularly of the gastrointestinal tract, is a minor, but often
overlooked, feature.
Intellectual impairment occurs in a majority of patients, although
only 20–30% have an IQ <70. There is a range in the extent of intellectual disability, with some patients requiring specialized education
and having difficulty with reading and writing, to those less severely
affected who may only require some additional tutoring or assistance.
The extent of severity of the intellectual disability does not appear to
correlate with the severity of the myopathy but may be related to the
location of the mutations in the dystrophin gene. Epilepsy is slightly
more common than in the general pediatric population, although it
is not a salient feature of DMD. Autism-­like behavior may develop in
some patients. Dystrophin is expressed in brain and retina, as well as
in striated and cardiac muscle, though the level is lower in brain than
in muscle. This distribution might explain some of the central nervous
system manifestations. Abnormalities in cortical architecture and of
dendritic arborization may be detected neuropathologically; cerebral
atrophy is demonstrated by MRI late in the clinical course. Patients
with DMD and BMD may occasionally report myalgias that are often
exercise or exertion induced. Calcinosis of muscle is rare.
Death in males with DMD occurs in the late teens to 20s.The causes
of death are respiratory failure during sleep, intractable heart failure,
pneumonia, or, occasionally, aspiration and airway obstruction. In the
recent decade, and with the application of standards of care, survival is
prolonged into the 30s in many patients.
In BMD, the onset is often after 5 years or 7 years of age, and most
boys remain ambulatory into adulthood. Calf pseudohypertrophy, cardiomyopathy, and elevated serum levels of CK are similar to those of
patients with DMD. Cramps on exercise and myoglobinuria may be
initial presenting features. Given the increased level of activity in BMD
patients, the cardiac manifestations, including tachycardia, shortness
of breath, or fatigue, may be evident earlier in patients with BMD and
even in the setting of independent ambulation. Learning disabilities

are less common. The onset of weakness is later in BMD than in DMD.
The lifespan in patients with BMD is typically into the 40s and 50s, with
cardiac complications as well as pulmonary complications frequently
leading to morbidity.

LABORATORY FINDINGS

The serum CK level is consistently greatly elevated in DMD, even in
presymptomatic stages, including at birth. The usual serum concentration is 15,000-­35,000 IU/L (normal <160 IU/L). A normal serum CK
level is incompatible with the diagnosis of DMD, although in terminal
stages of the disease, the serum CK value may be considerably lower
than it was a few years earlier because there is less muscle to degenerate. Other lysosomal enzymes present in muscle, such as aldolase and
aspartate aminotransferase, are also increased but are less specific.
Cardiac assessment by echocardiography and ECG are essential
and should be monitored. The recommendation is for cardiac surveillance every year starting at the time of diagnosis, and then yearly. After
the diagnosis of DMD is established, patients should be referred to a
pediatric cardiologist who is familiar with the care of DMD patients

Genetic evaluation for DMD typically begins with deletion/duplication
analysis of the dystrophin gene, using dosage analysis. If negative, then
sequencing of the dystrophin gene by next-­generation sequencing is
performed. If genetic analysis is still negative for a pathogenic variant in the dystrophin gene, but if the suspicion is high based on clinical features and serum CK levels, then muscle biopsy with dystrophin
immunohistochemistry may be useful. Immunohistochemical staining
of frozen sections of muscle biopsy tissue detects differences in the rod
domain, the carboxyl terminus (that attaches to the sarcolemma), and
the N terminus or amino terminus (that attaches to the actin myofilaments) of the large dystrophin molecule and may be prognostic of the
clinical course as Duchenne or Becker disease. More severe weakness
occurs with truncation of the dystrophin molecule at the carboxyl terminus than at the amino terminus. Dystroglycans and other sarcolemmal regional proteins, such as merosin and sarcoglycans, also can be
measured because they may be secondarily decreased. Further genetic
testing could be done, which may include RNA sequencing from muscle to attempt to identify a variant altering splicing (e.g., one that may
not be identified on next-­generation sequencing). Accurate assignation
of pathogenicity and anticipated severity of a particular dystrophin
gene variant can be difficult, and free access to various international
databases is most helpful for the clinician; the Leiden pathogenic variant database maintained by the Leiden University Medical Center and
ClinVar hosted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(Bethesda, MD), are good examples.
The muscle biopsy is diagnostic and shows characteristic changes
(Figs. 649.2 and 649.3). Myopathic changes include endomysial connective tissue proliferation, scattered degenerating and regenerating myofibers, foci of mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrates as a
reaction to muscle fiber necrosis, mild architectural changes in still-­
functional muscle fibers, and many dense fibers. These hypercontracted fibers probably result from segmental necrosis at another level,
allowing calcium to enter the site of breakdown of the sarcolemmal
membrane and trigger a contraction of the whole length of the muscle
fiber. Calcifications within myofibers are correlated with secondary β-­
dystroglycan deficiency.
The decision about whether muscle biopsy should be performed
to establish the diagnosis sometimes presents problems. If there is a

male with limb-­girdle muscular dystrophy (B), a 6-­yr-­old male with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (C), and a 10-­yr-­old male with Becker muscular
dystrophy (D). In the normal condition, and also in non–X-­linked muscular dystrophies in which dystrophin is not affected, the sarcolemmal membrane of every fiber is strongly stained, including atrophic and hypertrophic fibers. In Duchenne dystrophy, most myofibers express no detectable
dystrophin, but a few scattered fibers known as revertant fibers show near-­normal immunoreactivity. In Becker muscular dystrophy, the abnormal
dystrophin molecule is thin, with pale staining of the sarcolemma, in which reactivity varies not only between myofibers but also along the circumference of individual fibers (×250).

family history of the disease, particularly in the case of an involved
brother whose diagnosis has been confirmed, a patient with typical
clinical features of DMD and high concentrations of serum CK probably does not need to undergo biopsy. The result of the genetic testing
(dystrophin deletion/duplication analysis and sequencing) might also
influence whether to perform a muscle biopsy. If there is a doubt about
the pathogenicity of the dystrophin gene variant, muscle biopsy is useful in confirming or refuting the diagnosis. The most common muscles
sampled are the vastus lateralis and the gastrocnemius.

GENETIC ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS

Despite the X-­linked recessive inheritance in DMD, approximately 30%
of cases are new or de novo pathogenic variant, and the mother is not a
carrier. The female carrier state usually shows no muscle weakness, but
due to skewed X-­inactivation, about 8% of carrier females are manifesting carriers with some weakness, although typically milder than is
seen in affected males. These symptomatic females are explained by the
Lyon hypothesis, in which the normal X chromosome becomes inactivated and the one with the gene deletion is active (see Chapter 97).
The full clinical picture of DMD has occurred in several females with
Turner syndrome in whom the single X chromosome must have had
the Xp21 gene deletion.
The asymptomatic carrier state of DMD is associated with elevated
serum CK values in about 50% of cases. The level of increase is usually
in the magnitude of hundreds or a few thousand but does not have the
extreme values noted in affected males. Prepubertal females who are
carriers of the dystrophy also have increased serum CK values, with
highest levels at 8-­12 years of age. If the mother of an affected male has
normal CK levels, it is unlikely that her daughter can be identified as
a carrier by measuring CK. Muscle biopsy of suspected female carriers
can detect an additional 10% in whom serum CK is not elevated; a
specific genetic diagnosis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on
peripheral blood is definitive. Approximately 40% of female carriers
may be at risk of developing cardiomyopathy or fibrosis (determined
by cardiac imaging of carrier females), even in the absence of skeletal
muscle weakness.
A 427-­kDa cytoskeletal protein known as dystrophin is encoded by the
gene at the Xp21.2 locus. This gene contains 79 exons of coding sequence
and 2.5 Mb of DNA. This subsarcolemmal protein attaches to the sarcolemmal membrane overlying the A and M bands of the myofibrils and
consists of four distinct regions or domains: the amino terminus contains
250 amino acids and is related to the N-­actin binding site of α-­actinin;
the second domain is the largest, with 2,800 amino acids, and contains
many repeats, giving it a characteristic rod shape; a third, cysteine-­rich
domain is related to the carboxyl terminus of α-­actinin; and the final
carboxyl-­terminal domain of 400 amino acids is unique to dystrophin and
to a dystrophin-­related protein encoded by chromosome 6. The absence
of dystrophin at the sarcolemma disrupts the membrane cytoskeleton and
leads to loss secondarily of other components of the cytoskeleton.

The molecular defects in the dystrophinopathies vary and include
intragenic deletions, duplications, or point variants of nucleotides.
Approximately 65% of patients have deletions, approximately 10% exhibit
duplications, and approximately 10% have point variants or smaller rearrangements. In less than 1% of cases, a deep intronic variant may lead to
an alteration of splicing and thereby may impact the reading frame. The
site or size of the intragenic abnormality does not always correlate well
with the phenotypic severity; in both the Duchenne and Becker forms
the variants are mainly near the middle of the gene, involving deletions
in regions between exons 45 and 55. Phenotypic or clinical variations are
explained by the alteration of the translational reading frame of messenger RNA (mRNA), which results in unstable, truncated dystrophin molecules and severe, classic DMD; variants that preserve the reading frame
still permit translation of coding sequences further downstream on the
gene and produce a semifunctional dystrophin, expressed clinically as
BMD. An even milder form of adult-­onset disease, formerly known as
quadriceps myopathy, is also caused by an abnormal dystrophin molecule. The clinical spectrum of the dystrophinopathies, especially a presentation, not only includes the classic Duchenne and Becker forms but
also global developmental delay with autistic spectrum features, failure
to thrive, and symptomatic cardiomyopathy.
Analysis of the dystrophin protein requires a muscle biopsy and is
demonstrated by Western blot analysis or in tissue sections by immunohistochemical methods using either fluorescence or light microscopy of antidystrophin antisera (see Fig. 649.3). In classic DMD, levels
of <3% of normal are found; in BMD, the molecular weight of dystrophin is reduced to 20–90% of normal in 80% of patients, but in 15% of
patients the dystrophin is of normal size but reduced in quantity, and
5% of patients have an abnormally large protein caused by excessive
duplications or repeats of codons. Selective immunoreactivity of different parts of the dystrophin molecule in sections of muscle biopsy material distinguishes the Duchenne and Becker forms (Fig. 649.4). The
demonstration of deletions and duplications also can be made from
blood samples by the more rapid PCR, which identifies as many as 98%
of deletions by amplifying 18 exons but cannot detect duplications. The
diagnosis can thus be confirmed at the molecular genetic level from
either the muscle biopsy material or from peripheral blood, although
as many as 30% of males with DMD or BMD have a false-­normal blood
PCR; all cases of dystrophinopathy are detected by muscle biopsy.
The same methods of DNA analysis from blood samples may be
applied for carrier detection in female relatives at risk, such as sisters and cousins, and to determine whether the mother is a carrier or
whether a new variant occurred in the embryo. Prenatal diagnosis is
possible as early as the 12th week of gestation by sampling chorionic
villi for DNA analysis by Southern blot or PCR, and in cases of aborted
fetuses with DMD, muscle demonstrates abnormal dystrophin staining
by immunohistochemistry. Newborn screening for DMD is not currently part of the routine neonatal screening. Nonetheless, a CK-­based
test is available for families requesting screening.

in parts of the sarcolemma but not around the entire circumference in cross section. Alternatively, the prominence of dystrophin is less, appearing
weak, when compared with the simultaneously incubated normal control from another child of similar age (E). F, Merosin expression is normal in
this patient with Becker dystrophy, in both large and small myofibers, and is lacking only in frankly necrotic fibers. Compare with classic Duchenne
muscular dystrophy illustrated in Figures 649.3C and 649.8.

TREATMENT

There is no medical cure for this disease at this time. The mainstay
of management for DMD has been supportive care and prevention
of complications. Much can be done to treat complications and to
improve the quality of life of affected children. Updated, international
consensus care guidelines of DMD are available (pulmonary, cardiac,
bone) and are a key driver for improvement and management.
Glucocorticoids (prednisone or deflazacort) have been shown to slow
the decline in muscle strength and increase the time a patient maintains
independent ambulation, and it may have additional benefits on scoliosis
progression. Initiation of steroids is indicated when a child shows a plateau
in development and/or a regression in motor development as compared
with peers. This typically occurs by 4-­6 years old. Recommended doses are
prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day or deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day. Alternative protocols for steroid administration include weekend-­only dosing, alternate-­
day regimens, or 10-­day-­on/10-­day-­off regimens; the daily regimen has
been the preferred regimen based upon comparative studies. Long-­term
complications include weight gain, osteoporosis, delayed puberty, growth
retardation, acne, glucose intolerance, and cataracts. Given the improvements with steroids in motor abilities, as well as potentially in pulmonary,
orthopedic, and cardiac health, they are recommended for children with
DMD. Vamorolone, a novel corticosteroid, may have greater efficacy and
fewer adverse events (bone, growth, behavior) compared to conventional
steroid therapy; it is approved for children ≥ 2 years old.
Exondys 51 (eteplirsen) is an exon 51 skipping antisense oligonucleotide approach that binds RNA and skips over the defective exon,
restoring the reading frame, thereby producing a shorter but potentially functional dystrophin protein. This only applies to patients with
pathogenic variants amenable to this repair (∼13% of patients). It is
given as a weekly IV infusion. Ataluren permits read through of premature stop codons (10–15% of patients) from a nonsense variant, resulting in production of a functional dystrophin. It may have benefits in
patients at a certain level of disease progression. Golodirsen (Vyondys
53) and viltolarsen (Viltepso) are additional antisense oligonucleotides
that are approved for the ∼8% of patients with pathogenic variants in
exon 53. Cardiosphere-­derived cells, which have immune mediating,
antifibrotic, and regenerative properties, are undergoing investigation
for DMD.

Elevidys, an FDA approved recombinant gene therapy, delivers a
shortened (138kDa vs 427kDa) dystrophin protein that is expressed in
muscle in children 4-5 years old after a single intravenous dose.
Cardiac care initially includes angiotensin-­converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or β blockers. Other agents used
include aldosterone antagonists (e.g., Aldactone or eplerenone). Initiation
of cardiac medications at the time of a drop in the left ventricular ejection
fraction to <55% or for symptomatic cardiomyopathy is noncontroversial.
The prophylactic use of ACE inhibitors and β blockers aiming to delay
echocardiographic symptomatic cardiomyopathy is now recommended
from age 10 years onward by most consensus care guidelines. This is based
on recent data showing MRI changes in the heart preceding the echocardiogram abnormalities, and a potentially cardioprotective effect with
agents such as ACE inhibitors. Due to potential risks for hyperkalemic or
rhabdomyolytic reactions to anesthesia, it is recommended to avoid agents
such as inhaled anesthetics or muscle relaxants.
Pulmonary infections should be promptly treated. Patients should
avoid contact with children who have obvious respiratory or other
contagious illnesses. Immunizations for influenza virus and other routine vaccinations are indicated. When sleep-­disordered breathing is
suspected or the forced vital capacity drops below 60% predicted for
age, children should undergo sleep studies and the use of bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) should be considered. Additional devices
such as lung volume recruitment bag or a cough assist device, proper
suctioning, and nebulized therapies may assist with airway clearance as
children develop weakness in coughing.
Preservation of a good nutritional state is important. DMD is not
a vitamin-­deficiency disease, and excessive doses of vitamins should
be avoided. Adequate vitamin D and calcium intake is important to
minimize osteoporosis in boys confined to a wheelchair. However, due
to chronic corticosteroid use combined with the loss of ambulation,
boys with DMD are at higher risk for osteopenia and osteoporosis, putting them at higher risk for fractures in the setting of even minor injuries or falls. Dual x-­ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans should be done
in boys with DMD and vitamin D levels should be optimized. Some
patients with low bone density may require additional therapies such
as bisphosphonates, or testosterone in cases of pubertal delay. Because
of the decreased caloric expenditure in nonambulant children and the

Chapter 649 u Muscular Dystrophies
use of corticosteroids, these children tend to eat excessively and gain
weight. Obesity makes a patient with myopathy even less functional
because part of the limited reserve muscle strength is dissipated in lifting the weight of excess subcutaneous adipose tissue. Dietary restrictions with supervision may be needed.
Physiotherapy delays but does not always prevent contractures. At
times, contractures are actually useful in functional rehabilitation. If contractures prevent extension of the elbow beyond 90 degrees and the muscles of the upper limb no longer are strong enough to overcome gravity,
the elbow contractures are functionally beneficial in fixing an otherwise
flail arm and in allowing the patient to eat and write. Surgical correction
of the elbow contracture may be technically feasible, but the result may
be deleterious. Stretching and bracing methods may be useful depending
on the location of the contracture and level of severity of the contracture. Surgical interventions should be considered with caution and with
input from the neurologist, physical therapist, and/or physical medicine
and rehabilitation specialists involved in the child’s care. Physiotherapy
contributes little to muscle strengthening because patients usually are
already using their entire reserve for daily functioning, and exercise cannot further strengthen involved muscles. Excessive exercise can actually
accelerate the process of muscle fiber degeneration.
Special vigilance should be maintained in watching for scoliosis,
which often progresses more rapidly once the patient loses independent ambulation, and coincident with pubertal growth spurt.
Early referral to orthopedics is indicated as the definitive treatment
for progressive scoliosis is with spinal fusion surgery, and multidisciplinary team management is required to ensure the safety of
this major procedure, especially from the respiratory and cardiac
perspective.

649.2 Emery-­Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy/
Laminopathies
Adnan Y. Manzur
Emery-­Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a form of muscular
dystrophy caused by pathogenic variants involving nuclear envelope
proteins (see Table 649.1). It was first described as a rare X-­linked
recessive disorder caused by variant in EMD encoding emerin. The
locus of its associated genetic abnormality is on the long arm within
the large Xq28 region that includes other genes that cause myotubular
myopathy, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, and the Bloch-­Sulzberger
type of incontinentia pigmenti. Subsequently, dominant variants in
LMNA located on chromosome 1q21 that encodes for nuclear envelope protein lamin A/C, were found to be abnormal in male and female
affected patients. This form can manifest both as a congenital muscular
dystrophy (CMD) or one with an onset later in adolescence or adulthood, and it represents a broad phenotypic spectrum (see Table 649.2).
In addition to the motor manifestations, which are variable, there is
also a risk of sudden death from ventricular fibrillation, which can
occur as early as in childhood in some cases.
Clinical manifestations range from a CMD with severe weakness,
respiratory insufficiency, and contractures from infancy or children
with weakness and a dropped head syndrome to the more classic
EDMD forms. In the childhood-­onset EDMD forms, symptoms may
begin between 5 and 15 years of age, but many patients survive to late
adult life because of the slow progression of the course of the disease.
Muscles do not exhibit pseudohypertrophy. Contractures of the elbows,
ankles, and neck extensor muscles develop early, and muscle becomes
wasted in a scapulohumeroperoneal distribution. Facial weakness
does not typically occur; this disease is thus distinguished clinically
from autosomal dominant scapulohumeral and scapuloperoneal syndromes of neurogenic origin. Myotonia is absent. Intellectual function
is normal. Dilated cardiomyopathy is severe and is often the cause of
death, more commonly from conduction defects such as atrial fibrillation/flutter and sudden ventricular fibrillation than from intractable

3835

myocardial failure. Stroke is another complication, secondary to the
cardiac arrhythmia. Respiratory insufficiency is more prominent in the
early and severe forms and may require mechanical ventilation, especially in the severe congenital-­onset patients. The serum CK value is
only mildly to moderately elevated, further distinguishing this disease
from other X-­linked recessive muscular dystrophies.
Nonspecific myofiber necrosis and endomysial fibrosis are seen in
the muscle biopsy. Many centronuclear fibers and a selective histochemical type I muscle fiber atrophy can cause confusion with myotonic dystrophy.

GENETICS

The defective gene in the X-­linked form is called EMD or EDMD and
encodes a protein, emerin. Unlike other dystrophies in which the
defective gene is expressed at the sarcolemmal membrane, emerin is
expressed at the inner nuclear membrane; this protein stabilizes the
nuclear membrane against the mechanical stresses that occur during muscular contraction. It interacts with Nesprin-­1 and Nesprin-­2
genes, also critical for nuclear membrane integrity. Complete deletion of EDMD occurs in approximately 25% of cases and results from
an inversion in the Xq28 region; total absence of emerin is demonstrated by both Western blotting and immunoreactivity in tissue sections. Another gene, LMNA, at the 1q21 locus, is linked to the nuclear
envelope and encodes lamin A/C, sometimes termed laminopathy. This
genetic variant causes a similar clinical phenotype to EMD defects,
except that both sexes are affected, and it is transmitted as either an
autosomal dominant or recessive trait. Most EMD deletions are null
variants, whereas more than 80% of LMNA alterations are caused by
missense variants, and with a minority being nonsense or out-­of-­frame
variants. Desmin protein also may be abnormal and seen to be abnormally expressed in the muscle biopsy. Homozygous nonsense variants
in these lamin A/C genes are lethal due to cardiomyopathy and conduction disturbances. There remain many patients with an EDMD phenotype clinically, where the underlying genetic defect remains unknown.

DIAGNOSTICS

In suspected cases, emerin deficiency may be demonstrated not only
in the muscle biopsy by immunoreactivity and Western blotting techniques but also in a variety of other tissues, including circulating lymphocytes in peripheral blood, exfoliative buccal mucosal cells, and skin
fibroblasts. Emerin is absent in varying proportions in female carriers.
Muscle histology in LMNA patients is typically nonspecific with myopathic or mild dystrophic changes, with variability in fiber size, increase
in connective tissue, and necrotic fibers. Genetic testing of the specific
genes is available, and in a patient with typical phenotype may confirm
the diagnosis without the need for muscle biopsy. Patients should have
careful cardiac evaluation, including an electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and at least 24-­hour Holter monitoring. Serum CK levels may
be moderately elevated. Muscle MRI of the glutei and lower extremities
may be helpful, particularly in LMNA variants. EMG is not definitively
diagnostic. Muscle biopsy is diagnostic from the onset of symptoms.
In the differential diagnosis, an Emery-­Dreifuss–like syndrome with
joint contractures, mild weakness, and later-­onset cardiac symptoms is
caused by FHL1 variants of myofibrillar myopathy, but reducing bodies
are absent.
Treatment should be supportive, with special attention to cardiac
conduction defects, and can require medications or a pacemaker.
Implantable cardioverter-­defibrillators are available and have prevented sudden death in some patients with EDMD. In patients with
cardiac arrhythmias or a severe decrease in left ventricular function,
there may be an increased risk of thromboembolic events, and antithrombotic drugs may be considered. Pulmonary care should include
monitoring with pulmonary function tests as well as surveillance for
sleep-­disordered breathing if clinically indicated. Orthopedic management, use of orthotic devices, or physical therapy to try to minimize or slow down the rate of progression of contractures may be
beneficial.

3836 Part XXVI u Neuromuscular Disorders

649.3 Myotonic Muscular Dystrophy
Adnan Y. Manzur
Myotonic dystrophy is the second most common muscular dystrophy
in North America, Europe, and Australia, having an incidence varying from 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 100,000 in the general population. It is
inherited as an autosomal dominant trait (see Table 649.1). Classic
myotonic dystrophy (type 1) (DM1, or Steinert disease) is caused
by a CTG trinucleotide expansion on chromosome 19q13.3 in the 3′
untranslated region of DMPK, the gene that encodes a serine–threonine protein kinase. Type 2 (DM2) is associated with an unstable
CCTG tetranucleotide repeat expansion on chromosome 3q21 of an
intron of the zinc finger 9 protein gene. A third late form (DM3) is
identified at locus 15q21-­q24.
Myotonic dystrophy is an example of a genetic defect causing dysfunction in multiple organ systems. Not only is striated muscle severely
affected, but smooth muscle of the alimentary tract and uterus is also
involved, cardiac function is altered, and patients have multiple and
variable endocrinopathies, immunologic deficiencies, cataracts, dysmorphic facies, an increased risk for malignancies, intellectual impairment, and other neurologic abnormalities.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

DM1 becomes symptomatic at any age, but DM2 is rarely expressed
in infancy or early childhood. In the usual clinical course, excluding
the severe neonatal form, DM1 infants can appear almost normal at
birth, or facial wasting and hypotonia can already be early expressions
of the disease. The facial appearance is characteristic, consisting of an
inverted-­V–shaped upper lip, thin cheeks, and scalloped, concave temporalis muscles (Fig. 649.5). The head may be narrow, and the palate
is high and arched because the weak temporal and pterygoid muscles
in late fetal life do not exert sufficient lateral forces on the developing
head and face.
In DM1, weakness is often mild in the first few years (childhood-­
onset form) or may not even become evident until adolescence or
early adulthood (classic/adult-­onset form). Progressive wasting of distal muscles becomes increasingly evident, particularly in the intrinsic
muscles of the hands. The thenar and hypothenar eminences are flattened, and the atrophic dorsal interossei leave deep grooves between
the fingers. The dorsal forearm muscles and anterior compartment
muscles of the lower legs also become wasted. The tongue is thin and
atrophic. Wasting of the sternocleidomastoids gives the neck a long,
thin, cylindrical contour. Proximal muscles also eventually undergo
atrophy, and scapular winging appears. Difficulty with climbing stairs
and Gowers sign are progressive. Tendon stretch reflexes are usually
preserved.
The distal distribution of muscle wasting in myotonic dystrophy is
an exception to the general rule of myopathies having proximal and
neuropathies with distal distribution patterns. The muscular atrophy
and weakness in myotonic dystrophy are slowly progressive throughout childhood and adolescence and continue into adulthood. It is rare
for patients with myotonic dystrophy to lose the ability to walk even in
late adult life, although splints or bracing may be required to stabilize
the ankles.
Myotonia, a characteristic feature shared by few other myopathies,
does not occur in infancy and is usually not clinically or even electromyographically evident until about age 5 years. Exceptional patients
develop it as early as age 3 years. Myotonia is a very slow relaxation of
muscle after contraction, regardless of whether that contraction was
voluntary or was induced by a stretch reflex or electrical stimulation.
During physical examination, myotonia may be demonstrated by asking the patient to make tight fists and then to quickly open the hands
(grip myotonia; Fig. 649.6). It may be induced by striking the thenar
eminence with a rubber percussion hammer (percussion myotonia),
and it may be detected by watching the involuntary drawing of the
thumb across the palm. Myotonia can also be demonstrated in the
tongue by pressing the edge of a wooden tongue blade against its dorsal surface and by observing a deep furrow that disappears slowly. The

severity of myotonia does not necessarily parallel the degree of weakness, and the weakest muscles often have only minimal myotonia. Myotonia is not a painful muscle spasm. Musculoskeletal pain and fatigue
are fairly commonly reported in patients with myotonic dystrophy.
The speech of patients with myotonic dystrophy is often articulated
poorly and is slurred because of the involvement of the muscles of the
face, tongue, and pharynx. Both myotonia and weakness can drive the
difficulties in patients’ speech and swallowing. Difficulties with swallowing sometimes occur, and more severely involved patients may be
at risk for aspiration pneumonia. Incomplete external ophthalmoplegia
sometimes results from extraocular muscle weakness.
Smooth muscle involvement of the gastrointestinal tract results in
slow gastric emptying, poor peristalsis, and constipation. Some patients
have encopresis associated with anal sphincter weakness. Women with
myotonic dystrophy can have ineffective or abnormal uterine contractions during labor and delivery.
Cardiac involvement is usually manifested as heart block in the
Purkinje conduction system and arrhythmias (and sudden death)
rather than as cardiomyopathy, unlike most other muscular dystrophies. Atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmias have also resulted in sudden death in adults and older children.
Endocrine abnormalities involve many glands and appear at any
time during the course of the disease so that the endocrine status must
be reevaluated annually. Hypothyroidism is common; hyperthyroidism
occurs rarely. Adrenocortical insufficiency can lead to an addisonian
crisis even in infancy. Diabetes mellitus is common in patients with
myotonic dystrophy; some children have a disorder of insulin release
rather than defective insulin production. The onset of puberty may be
precocious or, more often, delayed. Testicular atrophy and testosterone deficiency are common in adults and are responsible for a high
incidence of male infertility. Ovarian atrophy is rare. Frontal baldness
is also characteristic in male patients and often begins in adolescence.
Immunologic deficiencies are common in myotonic dystrophy. The
plasma immunoglobulin G level is often low.
Cataracts often occur in myotonic dystrophy. They may be congenital, or they can begin at any time during childhood or adult life.
Early cataracts are detected only by slit-­lamp examination; periodic
examination by an ophthalmologist is recommended. Visual evoked
potentials are often abnormal in children with myotonic dystrophy and
are unrelated to cataracts. They are not usually accompanied by visual
impairment.
About half of the patients with myotonic dystrophy are intellectually impaired, but severe intellectual impairment is unusual. The
remainder are of average or occasionally above-­average intelligence.
Epilepsy is not common. Cognitive impairment might result from
accumulations of variant DMPK mRNA and aberrant alternative splicing in cerebral cortical neurons. A higher than expected incidence of
autism occurs in children with DM1.
A severe congenital form of myotonic dystrophy appears in a minority of involved infants born to mothers with myotonic dystrophy who
may be symptomatic with known diagnosis, or pauci-­symptomatic and
undiagnosed (see Fig. 649.5). All patients with this severe congenital
disease to date have had the DM1 form. Symptoms may present prenatally with polyhydramnios and decreased fetal movements. At birth,
patients typically have marked hypotonia, respiratory difficulties or
respiratory failure, and feeding difficulties; they may have additional
orthopedic manifestations, such as clubfoot deformities or more extensive congenital contractures (arthrogryposis multiplex congenita).
Facial wasting is prominent. Infants can require gavage feeding or
ventilator support for respiratory muscle weakness or apnea. Those
requiring ventilation for <30 days often survive, and those with prolonged ventilation have an infant mortality rate of 25% and a lower
likelihood of ventilator-­free survival. Children ventilated for <30 days
have better motor, language, and daily activity skills than those requiring prolonged ventilation. One or both leaves of the diaphragm may
be nonfunctional. The abdomen becomes distended with gas in the
stomach and intestine because of poor peristalsis from smooth muscle
weakness. The distention further compromises respiration. Inability to
empty the rectum can compound the problem. Myotonia is typically

not present in the congenital form during the neonatal period but may
be present in childhood (typically after 5 years old).

LABORATORY FINDINGS

The classic myotonic electromyogram is not found in infants but can
appear in children in the early school years. The levels of serum CK
and other serum enzymes from muscle may be normal or only mildly
elevated in the hundreds (never the thousands).
ECG should be performed annually in early childhood. Ultrasound
imaging of the abdomen may be indicated in affected infants to determine diaphragmatic function. Radiographs of the chest and abdomen
and additional studies of gastrointestinal motility or swallowing studies may be needed.
Endocrine assessment should be undertaken to determine thyroid
and adrenal cortical function and to verify carbohydrate metabolism
(glucose tolerance test). Immunoglobulins should be examined, and,
if needed, more extensive immunologic studies should be performed.

DIAGNOSIS

The primary diagnostic test is a DNA analysis of blood to demonstrate
the abnormal expansion of the CTG or CCTG repeat. Prenatal diagnosis also is feasible. The muscle biopsy specimen in older children
shows many muscle fibers with central nuclei and selective atrophy
of histochemical type I fibers, but degenerating fibers are usually few
and widely scattered, and there is little or no fibrosis of muscle. Intrafusal fibers of muscle spindles are also abnormal. In young children
with the common form of the disease, the biopsy specimen can even
appear normal or at least not show myofiber necroses, which is a striking contrast with DMD. In the severe neonatal form of myotonic dystrophy, the muscle biopsy reveals maturational arrest in various stages
of development in some and congenital muscle fiber–type disproportion in others. It is likely that the sarcolemmal membrane of muscle
fibers not only has abnormal properties of electrical polarization but
is also incapable of responding to trophic influences of the motor
neuron. Muscle biopsy is not usually required for diagnosis, which in
typical cases can be based on the clinical manifestations, including the
family history, and molecular genetic diagnosis. Neonatal myotonic

dystrophy causing arthrogryposis multiplex and/or severe neonatal
hypotonia must be distinguished from amyoplasia, congenital muscular dystrophy with or without merosin expression, congenital myasthenia gravis, spinal muscular atrophy, and arthrogryposis secondary to
oligohydramnios.

GENETICS

The genetic defect in myotonic muscular dystrophy is on chromosome
19 at the 19q13 locus. It consists of an expansion of the DM gene that
encodes a serine–threonine kinase (DMPK), with numerous repeats of
the CTG codon. Expansions range from 50 to >2,000, with the normal
alleles of this gene ranging in size from 5-­37; the larger the expansion, the
more severe the clinical expression, with the largest expansions seen in
the severe neonatal form. Rarely, the disease is associated with no detectable repeats, perhaps a spontaneous correction of a previous expansion
but a phenomenon still incompletely understood. Another myotonic
dystrophy (proximal myotonic myopathy) is a clinical entity linked to
at least two different chromosomal loci than classic myotonic dystrophy
but to one locus that shares a common unique pathogenesis in being
mediated by a variant in mRNA. Defects in RNA splicing explain the
insulin resistance in myotonic dystrophies as well as the myotonia.
Clinical and genetic expression can vary between siblings or between
an affected parent and child. In the severe neonatal form of the disease, the mother is the transmitting parent in 94% of cases, a fact not
explained by increased male infertility alone. Several cases of paternal
transmission have been reported, but this is a very rare occurrence.
Genetic analysis reveals that symptomatic neonates usually have many
more repeats of the CTG codon than do patients with the more classic
form of the disease, regardless of which parent is affected. Myotonic
dystrophy often exhibits a pattern of anticipation in which each successive generation has a tendency to be more severely involved than the
previous generation. Prenatal genetic diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy
is available.

TREATMENT

There is no specific medical treatment, but the cardiac, endocrine, gastrointestinal, and ocular complications can often be treated. Physiotherapy and orthopedic treatment of contractures in the neonatal form
of the disease may be beneficial. Myotonia may improve with exercise
(warm-­up phenomenon), and avoidance of extreme cold temperatures
may be helpful. Cardiac surveillance with an annual ECG as well as
Holter studies and an echocardiogram about every 2 years should be
pursued. Cardiac pacemaker implantation might be considered for
heart block, and antiarrhythmic drugs might be indicated but are
needed only rarely in children. Respiratory issues should be addressed;
management strategies may include BiPAP, cough assist, and incentive
spirometry.

3838 Part XXVI u Neuromuscular Disorders
Myotonia may be diminished by drugs that raise the depolarization
threshold of muscle membranes, such as mexiletine, phenytoin, carbamazepine, procainamide, and quinidine sulfate. These drugs also have cardiotropic effects; thus cardiac evaluation is important before prescribing
them. Phenytoin and carbamazepine are used in doses similar to those
when used as antiepileptics (see Chapter 633.6); serum concentrations of
10-­20 μg/mL for phenytoin and 5-­12 μg/mL for carbamazepine should
be maintained. If a patient’s disability is caused mainly by weakness
rather than by myotonia, these drugs will be of no value. Excess sleepiness is sometimes managed with methylphenidate or modafinil. Low-­
impact to moderate exercise may be beneficial for myalgias.
Anesthesia precautions should be considered given the higher rates
of complications with anesthesia in patients with myotonia. Succinylcholine should be avoided due to the risk of myotonia, and, instead,
short-­acting nondepolarizing muscle relaxants should be used that
are modified in terms of dosing for the extent of muscle wasting. For
induction, a modified rapid-­sequence induction for intubation should
be used. During recovery, neostigmine should be used with caution,
and extubation should occur when a patient is more fully awake. Following sedation, patients should be monitored closely because of the
risk of aspiration.

OTHER MYOTONIC SYNDROMES

Most patients with myotonia have myotonic dystrophy. However,
myotonia is not specific for this disease and occurs in several rarer
conditions.
Myotonic chondrodystrophy (Schwartz-­Jampel disease) is a rare
congenital disease characterized by generalized muscle hypertrophy
and weakness. Dysmorphic phenotypic features and the radiographic
appearance of long bones are reminiscent of Morquio disease (see Chapter 107), but abnormal mucopolysaccharides are not found. Dwarfism,
joint abnormalities, and blepharophimosis are present. Several patients
have been the products of consanguinity, suggesting autosomal recessive
inheritance. The muscle protein perlecan, encoded by the SJS1 gene, a
large heparan sulfate proteoglycan of basement membranes and cartilage, is defective in some cases of Schwartz-­Jampel disease and explains
both the muscular hyperexcitability and the chondrodysplasia.
EMG reveals continuous electrical activity in muscle fibers, closely
resembling or identical to myotonia. Muscle biopsy reveals nonspecific
myopathic features, which are minimal in some cases and pronounced
in others. The sarcotubular system is dilated.

Myotonia congenita (Thomsen disease), a channelopathy, is the
most common of the nondystrophic myotonia syndromes (Tables
649.3-­649.6) and is characterized by weakness and generalized muscular hypertrophy so that affected children resemble bodybuilders (Herculean appearance). Myotonia is prominent and can develop at age
2-­3 years, earlier than in myotonic dystrophy. The disease is clinically
stable and is apparently not progressive for many years. EMG demonstrates myotonia. Muscle biopsy specimens show minimal pathologic changes and is not indicated for diagnosis. Various families are
described as showing either autosomal dominant (Thomsen disease)
or recessive (Becker disease, not to be confused with BMD or DMD)
inheritance. Pathogenic variants may be nonsense, missense, or frameshift. However, specifically, missense variants that alter the activation
of the CLC-­1 dimer leads to the dominantly inherited forms of the
disease. Patients with the recessive form (Becker disease) tend to have
more severe disease. The autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of myotonia congenita have been mapped to the same 7q35
locus. This gene is important for the integrity of chloride channels of
the sarcolemmal and T-­tubular membranes.
Paramyotonia is a temperature-­related myotonia that is aggravated
by cold and alleviated by warm external temperatures. Patients have
difficulty when swimming in cold water or if they are dressed inadequately in cold weather. Paramyotonia congenita (Eulenburg disease)
is a defect in a gene at the 17q13.1-­13.3 locus, the identical locus identified in hyperkalemic periodic paralysis. By contrast with myotonia
congenita, paramyotonia is a disorder of the voltage-­gated sodium
channel caused by a pathogenic variant in the α subunit. Myotonic
dystrophy also is a sodium channelopathy (see Table 649.5).
In sodium channelopathies, exercise produces increasing myotonia,
whereas in chloride channelopathies, exercise reduces the myotonia.
This is easily tested during examination by asking patients to close the
eyes forcefully and open them repeatedly; it becomes progressively
more difficult in sodium channel disorders and progressively easier in

Treatments for the nondystrophic myotonias include mexiletine as
the first-­line (both for sodium channel and chloride channel myotonias) treatment. Mexiletine has been shown to improve stiffness as well
as decrease handgrip myotonia. Other treatment options include carbamazepine, phenytoin, and gabapentin.

649.4 Limb-­Girdle Muscular Dystrophies
Adnan Y. Manzur
LGMDs encompass a heterogeneous group of progressive hereditary
muscular dystrophies that mainly affect muscles of the hip and shoulder girdles (Table 649.7). Distal muscles also eventually become atrophic and weak, and in a few subtypes, distal muscles such as calves may
have weakness earlier in disease. Hypertrophy of the calves and ankle
contractures develop in some forms, causing potential confusion with
BMD. Over 30 genetic forms of LGMD are described, each at a different chromosomal locus and expressing different protein defects (see
Table 649.1). Some include diseases classified with other traditional
groups, such as the lamin A/C defects of the nuclear membrane (see
EDMD), and some forms of CMD. LGMD1 denotes autosomal dominant inheritance and LGMD2 implies an autosomal recessive trait, but
neither term defines the genetic etiology. LGMD2 is mainly a group of
several sarcoglycanopathies, calpainopathy resulting from a mutation in
the calpain-­3 gene (CAPN3), α-­dystroglycanopathies, or dysferlinopathies that include Miyoshi myopathy (which usually does not become
symptomatic until late adolescence into adult life).
The onset of disease is variable, with some patients manifesting by
4-­5 years of age (e.g., sarcoglycanopathies), to others presenting in

late adolescence to adulthood (e.g., dysferlinopathy or anoctaminopathy). For many LGMDs, the initial clinical manifestations rarely
appear before middle or late childhood or may be delayed until early
adult life. Low back pain may be a presenting complaint because of
the lordotic posture resulting from gluteal muscle weakness. In many
of these disorders, loss of independent ambulation may occur, ranging from within the first decade of life to loss of ambulation in early
adulthood, highlighting the variability in rate of progression (even for
the same disease). Although weakness of neck flexors and extensors
is common, weakness of facial, lingual, and other bulbar-­innervated
muscles are rarely involved. As weakness and muscle wasting progress, tendon stretch reflexes become diminished. Cardiac involvement can occur in some of the subtypes. Intellectual function is
generally normal in most, but can be involved to varying degrees,
especially in some of the α-­dystroglycanopathies (e.g., LGMDs due to
gene variants in POMT2, POMGnT1, GMPPB, and ISPD). The clinical
differential diagnosis of LGMD includes juvenile/type 3 spinal muscular atrophy (Kugelberg-­Welander disease), myasthenia gravis, and
metabolic myopathies.
The EMG and muscle biopsy frequently show confirmatory evidence of muscular dystrophy, but none of the findings are specific
enough to make the definitive diagnosis without additional clinical or immunohistochemical criteria. In some cases, α-­sarcoglycan

3842 Part XXVI u Neuromuscular Disorders
(formerly known as adhalin), a dystrophin-­related glycoprotein of
the sarcolemma, is deficient; this specific defect may be demonstrated
in the muscle biopsy by immunocytochemistry, as may deficiency of
three other forms of sarcoglycan as well. Increased serum CK level
is typical, but the magnitude of elevation varies among families. The
ECG is usually unaltered.
A variant in dystrophin-­associated protein in the sarcoglycan complex (sarcoglycanopathy; LGMD types 2C, 2E, and 2F) is responsible
for some cases of autosomal recessive LGMD. Most sarcoglycanopathies
result from a pathogenic variant in α-­sarcoglycan; other LGMDs resulting from deficiencies in β-­, γ-­, and δ-­sarcoglycan also occur. In normal
smooth muscle, α-­sarcoglycan is replaced by ε-­sarcoglycan, and the
others are the same. Dystroglycanopathies are caused by variants leading to the abnormal glycosylation of α-­dystroglycan, and regardless of
the gene, all variants seem to be implicated in a common pathway that
impacts dystroglycan function. Histochemically, dystroglycanopathies
often show defects (loss or reduction) of immunoreactivity to one of two
antibodies, VIA41 or IIH6, which recognize carbohydrate moieties of
α-­dystroglycan. The extent of reduction can vary from subtle to severe.
Another group of LGMDs (type 2B) are caused by allelic variants
of the dysferlin (DYSF) gene, another gene expressing a protein essential to structural integrity of the sarcolemma, though not associated
with the dystrophin-­glycoprotein complex. DYSF interacts with caveolin-­3 or calpain-­3, and DYSF deficiency may be secondary to defects
in these other gene products. Dysferlinopathies can present with the
classic LGMD pattern of proximal weakness or may present with early
weakness in the lower legs, specifically calf weakness, known as Miyoshi myopathy. Primary calpain-­3 defect (type 2A) has wide clinical
variability, with age of onset ranging from 2-­40 years old, and age at
loss of independent ambulation ranging from 5 years old to the late
30s. Respiratory compromise can be seen later in the disease but is
less severe than in some other LGMDs. Both are slowly progressive
myopathies with onset in adolescence or young adult life and can affect
distal as well as proximal muscles. Cardiomyopathy is rare. Chronically elevated serum CK in the thousands is found in dysferlinopathies. Ultrastructure shows a thickened basal lamina over defects in the
sarcolemma and replacement of the sarcolemma by multiple layers of
small vesicles. Regenerating myofibers outnumber degenerating myofibers. Pathogenic variants in CAV3 can also have a variable neuromuscular phenotype ranging from: limb-­girdle phenotype (LGMD1C) to
distal myopathy to rippling muscle disease to hyperCKemia and exercise intolerance. There are also reports of patients with rhabdomyolysis
with caveolinopathies. These disorders were formerly called hyperCKemia and rippling muscle disease, the latter sometimes confused with
myotonia. An autosomal recessive variant in the calcium-­activated
chloride channel anoctamin-­5 can causes one of the following phenotypes: a proximal LGMD2L, a distal Miyoshi myopathy phenotype,
or hyperCKemia. It typically presents in adulthood and is more commonly seen in Northern Europe and Canada. There does not seem to
be any associated cardiomyopathy, although there are reports of early
premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).
There is genetic overlap of the group of LGMDs with the congenital muscular dystrophies, such as Walker-­Warburg syndrome with
POMT, Fukuyama muscular dystrophy with FKRP genetic defects,
and GMPPB. Patients with pathologic variants in these genes can present with an early CMD-­like phenotype to a childhood or later-­onset
LGMD phenotype, and in both motor phenotypes may or may not
have varying degrees of intellectual disability.

649.5 Facioscapulohumeral Muscular
Dystrophy
Adnan Y. Manzur
Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is the third most
common muscular dystrophy (after Duchenne muscular dystrophy and
myotonic dystrophy). Autosomal dominant inheritance is generally

the mode of inheritance, and genetic anticipation is often found within
several generations of a family, the succeeding more severely involved
at an earlier age than the preceding. The genetic mechanism in autosomal dominant FSHD1 involves integral deletions of a 3.3-­kb tandem
repeat (D4Z4) in the subtelomeric region at the 4q35 locus. D4Z4 acts
as a lamin-­dependent insulator, exhibiting both enhancer-­blocking
and barrier activities, and displaces the telomere toward the nuclear
periphery. Normally, there are 11-­100 tandem copies or D4Z4 repeats.
When there are fewer repeats (<10 repeat units), this enables chromatin
remodeling and leads to decreased methylation, thus turning on DUX4
expression (which is normally dormant). In addition, the disease will
only manifest in chromosomes that carry a pLAM1 polyadenylate site
distal to the last D4Z4 repeat. When these factors all exist, this creates a “permissive” haplotype or state that allows for the expression of
DUX4, which is normally repressed. Approximately 5–10% of families
with this phenotype do not map to the 4q35 locus. FSHD2, although
clinically overlapping with FSHD1, is not caused by the contraction in
D4Z4 repeats. However, instead, it is caused by pathogenic variants of
SMCHD1 (on chromosome 18p) that can lead to hypomethylation of
D4Z4. When these variants exist in the setting of a permissive haplotype and the polyadenylation signal, DUX4 is expressed, again sharing a final common pathway in leading to the same clinical disease.
The prevalence varies geographically but ranges from 1:8,000-­20,000.
Though the clinical onset is generally in later childhood or adult life,
early molecular defects arising during myogenesis are demonstrated
in the human fetus, and patients can present as early as in the infantile
period.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) shows the earliest and most
severe weakness in facial and shoulder girdle muscles (Fig. 649.7).
Asymmetric weakness or patchy weakness, when present, should raise
suspicion for FSHD. The facial weakness in FSHD differs from that
of myotonic dystrophy; rather than an inverted-­V–shaped upper lip,
the mouth in FSHD is rounded and appears puckered because the lips
protrude. Inability to close the eyes completely in sleep is a common
expression of upper facial weakness; some patients have extraocular
muscle weakness, although ophthalmoplegia is rarely complete. FSHD
has been associated with Möbius syndrome on rare occasions. Pharyngeal and tongue weakness may be absent and is never as severe as the
facial involvement. Hearing loss, which may be subclinical, and retinal
vasculopathy (indistinguishable from Coats disease) are associated features, particularly in severe cases of FSHD with early-­childhood onset.
Scapular winging is prominent, often even in infants. Flattening or
even concavity of the deltoid contour is seen, and the biceps and triceps brachii muscles are wasted and weak. Muscles of the hip girdle
and thighs also eventually lose strength and undergo atrophy, and the
Gowers sign and a Trendelenburg gait appear. Contractures of the
extremities are rare. Finger and wrist weakness occasionally is the first
symptom. Weakness of the anterior tibial and peroneal muscles can
lead to foot drop; this complication usually occurs only in advanced
cases with severe weakness. Lumbar hyperlordosis and kyphoscoliosis
are common complications of axial muscle involvement. Calf pseudohypertrophy is not a usual feature but is described rarely.
There is a great deal of clinical variability, including within families.
FSHD can be a mild disease, causing minimal disability. Clinical manifestations might not be expressed in childhood and are delayed into
middle adult life. In more severe cases, patients may present early in
life. About 20% of patients will lose independent ambulation, and about
10–15% of patients may require noninvasive or invasive respiratory support. Unlike most other muscular dystrophies, asymmetry of weakness is
common. About 30% of affected patients are asymptomatic or show only
mild scapular winging and decreased tendon stretch reflexes, of which
they were unaware until formal neurologic examination was performed.

LABORATORY FINDINGS

Serum levels of CK and other enzymes vary greatly, ranging from normal or near normal to elevations of several thousand. An ECG should
be performed, although the anticipated findings are usually normal.
EMG reveals nonspecific myopathic muscle potentials. Diagnostic

DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

Molecular genetic diagnosis is the most specific confirmation if clinical suspicion is high, with or without a family history of the disease.
Muscle biopsy distinguishes more than one form of FSHD, consistent
with clinical evidence that several distinct diseases are embraced by
the term facioscapulohumeral dystrophy. Muscle biopsy and EMG also
distinguish the primary myopathy from a neurogenic disease with a
similar distribution of muscular involvement. The general histopathologic findings in the muscle biopsy material are extensive proliferation
of connective tissue between muscle fibers, extreme variation in fiber
size with many hypertrophic as well as atrophic myofibers, and scattered degenerating and regenerating fibers. An inflammatory type of
FSHD is also distinguished, characterized by extensive lymphocytic
infiltrates within muscle fascicles. Despite the resemblance of this form
to inflammatory myopathies such as polymyositis, there is no evidence
of autoimmune disease, and steroids and immunosuppressive drugs do
not alter the clinical course. A precise histopathologic diagnosis has
important therapeutic implications. Mononuclear cell inflammation in
a muscle biopsy sample of infants younger than 2 years old is usually
FSHD or, less often, a CMD.

TREATMENT

Pulmonary function should be followed routinely, and if there are concerns for daytime headaches or increased fatigue, a sleep study should
be performed to assess for any sleep-­disordered breathing or sleep
apnea. Light aerobic exercise and stretching regimens may help to prevent deconditioning or disuse atrophy over time. High-­intensity training, strength training, or weightlifting are not recommended because
they will not help in regaining strength or retarding the progression of
weakness or muscle wasting. Foot drop and scoliosis may be treated by
orthopedic measures. In selected cases, surgical wiring of the scapulae (scapular fixation surgery) to the thoracic wall provides improved
shoulder stability and abduction of the arm, but brachial plexopathy,
frozen shoulder, and scapular fractures are reported complications.
Additional rehabilitation options for scapular support include kinesiotaping. Chronic pain can be seen commonly in patients with FSHD,
and may require further management, including gabapentin, tricyclic
antidepressants, or exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy. Cosmetic improvement of the facial muscles of expression may be achieved
by reconstructive surgery, which grafts a fascia lata to the zygomatic
muscle and to the zygomatic head of the quadratus labii superioris
muscle. Exercise of facial muscles can help minimize secondary disuse atrophy. Routine eye exams should be performed (testing for Coats

Fig. 649.7 Overview of affected muscles in FSHD. The symptoms
tend to start at the upper half of the body and then spread to lower
body parts involving the pelvic girdle and the leg muscles. There is
a high degree of clinical variability in disease severity, and affected
muscles are generally involved asymmetrically regarding the left-­right
body axis. In some cases, patients with foot drop can be supported
by ankle-­foot orthotics (AFOs) and knee-­ankle-­foot orthotics (KAFOs).
Surgery to attach the scapula to the ribcage can enhance arm motion
or alleviate pain. (From Schätzl T, Kaiser L, Deigner HP. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy: genetics, gene activation and downstream signaling with regard to recent therapeutic approaches: an

649.6 Congenital Muscular Dystrophies
Adnan Y. Manzur
The term congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) refers to a group of
hereditary disorders with early (prenatal, neonatal, or early-­childhood)
onset and histologic features suggestive of a dystrophic process. It is
used to encompass several distinct diseases that have a common characteristic of severe involvement at birth or in early childhood but that,
ironically, often follow a more benign clinical course than the early
onset and histopathologic changes in the muscle biopsy would suggest.
A distinguishing feature of the congenital dystrophies, by contrast with
other muscular dystrophies, is a high association with brain malformations, particularly disorders of cortical development such as lissencephaly/pachygyria and polymicrogyria, often complicated by severe
epilepsy (Fig. 649.8). Most of the CMDs are inherited in an autosomal
recessive manner (see Table 649.2).

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

In several distinct clinical and genetic diseases grouped under the
umbrella term congenital muscular dystrophies, infants often have
contractures or arthrogryposis at birth and are diffusely hypotonic.
In some cases, weakness in infancy may be less significant and initial
motor milestones may even be normal. The muscle mass is thin in the
trunk and extremities. Head control is often poor due to neck weakness
and marked axial hypotonia. Facial muscles may be mildly involved,
but ophthalmoplegia, pharyngeal weakness, and weak sucking are not
common. A minority has severe dysphagia and requires gavage or gastrostomy. Tendon stretch reflexes may be hypoactive or absent. Distal
arthrogryposis is common in all forms of CMD (see Chapter 648.10).
Congenital contractures involving axial or proximal joints (including,
for example, of the elbows) are often suggestive of Ullrich CMD due to
pathologic variant(s) in one of the three collagen VI genes (COL6A1,
COL6A2, COL6A3).
The CMDs can be classified according to the type of protein altered
by the specific genetic variants. Diseases of extracellular matrix proteins include LAMA2-­
related CMD (merosin deficiency, LAMA2
pathogenic variant at locus 6q22-­q23) and COL6-­related CMD (Ullrich CMD in the more severe form, to Bethlem myopathy in the milder

form of the disease) (COL6A1, -­A2, and -­A3 variants at 21q22 and
2q37 loci). A protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (SEPN1 variant at
1p35) is the basis of rigid spine syndrome. Abnormal glycosylation of
α-­dystroglycan causes Walker-­Warburg syndrome (POMT1 variant at
9q34), muscle-­eye-­brain disease of Santavuori (POMGnT1 variant at
1p32), Fukuyama muscular dystrophy (FCMD variant at 8q31-­q33 and
9q31), and CMD with secondary merosin deficiency (FKRP variant at
19q13). Pathogenic variants in genes that affect the glycosylation of α-­
dystroglycan can also lead to milder or later-­onset LGMD phenotypes
(with or without intellectual involvement; see Chapter 649.4). Glycosylation defects (dystroglycanopathies) result in defective neuroblast
migration in the fetal brain and also can cause dilated cardiomyopathy.
The dystroglycan molecule interacts with both proteins of the plasma
(sarcolemmal) membrane and those of the extracellular matrix and
basal lamina not only in muscle but also in brain, where defective
dystroglycan and poor glycosylation result in gaps in the pial limiting membrane, a discontinuous glia limitans, causing cobblestone lissencephaly and glioneuronal heterotopia of overmigrated neural cells
during formation of the cerebral cortex.
The Fukuyama type of CMD is the second most common muscular
dystrophy in Japan (after DMD); it has also been reported in children of
Dutch, German, Scandinavian, and Turkish ethnic backgrounds. In the
Fukuyama variety, severe cardiomyopathy and malformations of the brain
usually accompany the skeletal muscle involvement. Signs and symptoms
related to these organs are prominent: cardiomegaly and heart failure,
intellectual disability, seizures, microcephaly, and failure to thrive.
Central neurologic disease can accompany forms of CMD other
than Fukuyama disease. The mental and neurologic status is the most
variable feature; an apparently normal brain and normal intelligence
do not preclude the diagnosis if other manifestations indicate this
myopathy. The cerebral malformations that occur are not consistently
of one type and vary from severe dysplasias (holoprosencephaly, lissencephaly) to milder conditions (agenesis of the corpus callosum,
focal heterotopia of the cerebral cortex and subcortical white matter,
cerebellar hypoplasia). Seizures are a frequent complication, as early as
the neonatal period, and may include infantile spasms and other severe
infantile epilepsies.
CMD is a constant association with cerebral dysgenesis in the Walker-­
Warburg syndrome and in muscle-­eye-­brain disease. The neuropathologic findings are those of neuroblast migratory abnormalities

in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and brainstem. Studies indicate
considerably more genetic overlap between Walker-­Warburg, Fukuyama, and muscle-­eye-­brain forms of CMD that explain mixed and
transitional phenotypes, so that, for example, a Fukutin-­related (FKRP)
gene can cause a Walker-­Warburg or muscle-­eye-­brain presentation,
or POMGnT1 also can produce phenotypes other than classic Walker-­
Warburg disease.

LABORATORY FINDINGS

The serum CK level is usually moderately elevated from several
hundred to many thousand IU/L; only marginal increases are sometimes found. EMG shows nonspecific myopathic features. Investigation of all forms of CMD should include cardiac assessment
and an imaging study of the brain. In the past, muscle biopsy was
considered essential for the diagnosis, but currently a confirmed
genetic mutation together with a typical phenotype or a confirmed
genetic defect in a sibling, allows a confident diagnosis, avoiding a
muscle biopsy.

DIAGNOSIS

Muscle biopsy is diagnostic in the neonatal period or thereafter. An
extensive proliferation of endomysial collagen envelops individual
muscle fibers even at birth, also causing them to be rounded in cross-­
sectional contour by acting as a rigid sleeve, especially during contraction. The perimysial connective tissue and fat are also increased, and
the fascicular organization of the muscle may be disrupted by the fibrosis. Tissue cultures of intramuscular fibroblasts exhibit increased collagen synthesis, but the structure of the collagen is normal. Muscle fibers
vary in diameter, and many show central nuclei, myofibrillar splitting,
and other cytoarchitectural alterations. Scattered degenerating and
regenerating fibers are seen. No inflammation or abnormal inclusions
are found.
Immunocytochemical reactivity for merosin (α2 chain of laminin)
at the sarcolemmal region is absent in approximately 40% of cases and
normally expressed in the others (Figs. 649.9 and 649.10). Merosin is
a protein that binds the sarcolemmal membrane of the myofiber to
the basal lamina or basement membrane. Merosin also is expressed in
brain and in Schwann cells. The presence or absence of merosin does
not always correlate with the severity of the myopathy or predict its
course. Adhalin (α-­dystroglycan) may be reduced to varying degrees

in the α-­dystroglycanopathies, and there can be secondary reduction
of merosin (laminin 211). Collagen VI is selectively reduced, absent, or
mislocalized in COL6-­related CMDs. Mitochondrial dysfunction may
be another secondary defect.

TREATMENT

Supportive care at this time is the mainstay of therapy. A consensus
statement on the management of patients with congenital muscular
dystrophies was published in 2010 by Wang, et al. Given the high prevalence of respiratory insufficiency in this population, it is important
at every visit to screen for respiratory function with pulmonary function testing and eliciting information on the frequency and duration
of respiratory illnesses, the frequency of lower respiratory infections,
abnormal breathing in sleep, increased daytime fatigue, or headaches.
Sleep studies should be performed early (especially in collagen VI CMD
and SEPN1 muscular dystrophy), where the respiratory compromise
can occur even in ambulant patients because of increased diaphragmatic weakness. Additional respiratory supports may include chest
physical therapy, cough assist with suctioning, BiPAP, and, in more
advanced stages, invasive ventilation or sip/puff ventilation options for
continuous ventilator supports. Weight gain should be optimized to

A

make sure the patient is not losing weight or gaining excess weight.
Swallowing should be assessed to screen for dysphagia. Some children
will require G-­tube feeds due to insufficient oral intake to meet caloric
needs, whereas others may require nearly full G-­tube feeds due to
swallowing difficulties. Speech therapy may be needed for assessment
for dysphagia but also because some of these children will have some
difficulty with articulation because of oromotor weakness that can
affect communication early in life. Constipation occurs frequently and
should be medically managed through diet or stool softeners. Physical therapists and physiatrists should be involved in working with the
patients on assistive devices and stretching and bracing regimens to
try to slow down the progression of or manage contractures. Children
may develop scoliosis (or in collagen VI–related CMD, kyphoscoliosis
deformities), and should be followed regularly by orthopedic specialists to determine when bracing or surgical interventions are needed.
Children with α-­dystroglycanopathies with central nervous system
involvement may require additional supports, including speech therapies, individualized education plans for learning and intellectual disabilities, seizure management, and spasticity management.

Endocrine and Toxic
Myopathies
Adnan Y. Manzur*
THYROID MYOPATHIES

See also Chapters 601-­606 and Table 650.1.
Thyrotoxicosis causes proximal weakness and wasting accompanied by myopathic electromyographic changes. Rarely the myopathy may be limited to painless external ophthalmoplegia and
proptosis, at least initially. Thyroxine binds to myofibrils and, if
in excess, impairs contractile function. Hyperthyroidism can also
induce myasthenia gravis and hypokalemic periodic paralysis, the
latter mainly affecting East Asian males who have a genetic predisposition. A pathologic variant in the gene KCNJ18 may be responsible for altering the potassium channel Kir2.6 in up to one third
of cases. Potassium supplementation and propranolol are useful in
treating thyrotoxic periodic paralysis.
Hypothyroidism, whether congenital or acquired, consistently produces hypotonia and a proximal distribution of weakness. Although
muscle wasting is most characteristic, one form of cretinism, Kocher-­
Debré-­Sémélaigne syndrome, is characterized by generalized pseudohypertrophy of weak muscles. Infants can have a Herculean appearance
reminiscent of myotonia congenita. The serum creatine kinase (CK)
level is elevated in hypothyroid myopathy and returns to normal after
thyroid replacement therapy.
Results of muscle biopsy in hypothyroidism reveal acute myopathic
changes, including myofiber necrosis and sometimes central cores. In
hyperthyroidism, the muscle biopsy specimen shows only mild, nonspecific myopathic changes without necrosis of myofibers. The clinical
and pathologic features of hyperthyroid myopathy and hypothyroid
myopathy resolve after appropriate treatment of the thyroid disorder.
Many of the systemic symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including myopathic weakness and ophthalmoparesis, improve with the administration of β blockers.
Most patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (see Chapter 613) develop weakness, fatigability, fasciculations, and muscle
wasting that is reversible after removal of the parathyroid adenoma.
The serum CK and muscle biopsy remain normal, but electromyography can show nonspecific myopathic features. A minority of
patients develop myotonia that could be confused with myotonic
dystrophy.

STEROID-­HORMONE INDUCED MYOPATHY

Cushing disease and iatrogenic Cushing syndrome from exogenous
corticosteroid administration can cause painless, symmetric, progressive proximal weakness, increased serum CK levels, and a myopathic
electromyogram and muscle biopsy specimen (see Chapter 619). Myosin filaments may be selectively lost. The 9α-­fluorinated steroids, such
as dexamethasone, betamethasone, and triamcinolone, are the most
likely to produce steroid myopathy. Dexamethasone alters the abundance of ceramides in myotubes in developing muscle. In patients
with dermatomyositis or other myopathies treated with steroids, it is
sometimes difficult to distinguish refractoriness of the disease from
steroid-­induced weakness, especially after long-­term steroid administration. Vitamin D is another factor altering muscle metabolism and

of this chapter is retained here.

particularly its sensitivity to insulin; vitamin D deficiency may be
accentuated and contribute to steroid myopathy, especially in type 2
diabetic patients and insulin resistance.
All patients who have been taking steroids for long periods
develop reversible type II myofiber atrophy; this is a steroid effect
but is not steroid myopathy unless it progresses to become a necrotizing myopathy. At greatest risk in the pediatric age-­group are
children requiring long-­term steroid therapy for asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatomyositis, lupus, and other autoimmune or
inflammatory diseases or who are being treated for leukemia or
other hematologic diseases. In addition to steroids, the drugs listed
in Table 650.2 can cause acute or chronic toxic myopathies. An
incompletely understood entity known as critical illness myopathy
is a progressive weakness of patients with extended illnesses who
remain in the intensive care unit; it is associated pathologically
with selective loss of thick (myosin) myofilaments; immobility and
excessive steroid treatment are believed to be important factors.
Various steroids are sometimes used chronically in the treatment
of Duchenne muscular dystrophy; they may actually exaggerate the
weakness because of steroid myopathy superimposed on the dystrophic process (see Chapter 649).
Hyperaldosteronism is accompanied by episodic and reversible weakness similar to that of periodic paralysis. Another clinical presentation is muscle cramps at rest. The proximal myopathy
can become irreversible in chronic cases. Elevated CK levels and
even myoglobinuria sometimes occur during acute attacks. Arterial hypertension is a frequent manifestation, and in children,
aldosterone-­secreting adenomas up to 6 mm in diameter or multiple adrenocortical micronodules of 0.5 mm should be considered
in the differential diagnosis of idiopathic hypertension and muscle
weakness or cramps. Hereditary primary aldosteronism is due to a
pathogenic variant in one of the potassium channel genes KCNJ5
and GIRK4.
Chronic growth hormone excess (sometimes illicitly acquired
by adolescent athletes or seen in acromegaly) produces atrophy of
some myofibers and hypertrophy of others, and scattered myofiber degeneration. Despite the augmented protein synthesis induced
by growth hormone, it impairs myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase activity and reduces sarcolemmal excitability, with resultant
diminished, rather than increased, strength corresponding to the
larger muscle mass. It has been used therapeutically in muscular
dystrophy with both a positive effect and complications. Ghrelin
is an intestinal hormone that activates a growth hormone secretagogue receptor and stimulates growth hormone release. In addition
to its effect as a “hunger hormone” that involves food intake and fat
deposition, it also prevents muscular atrophy by inducing myodifferentiation and myoblast fusion.

STATIN-­INDUCED RHABDOMYOLYSIS WITH
MYOGLOBINURIA

Myalgias and a self-­limited myopathy can be induced in 10–20%
of patients taking statin drugs (HMG-­C oA reductase inhibitors
[HMGCR]). In addition, a less common but more severe statin-­
associated immune-­
mediated necrotizing myopathy may occur
and is characterized by marked elevated CK levels, muscle edema
and necrosis, and the presence of anti-­HMGCR antibodies. These
widely prescribed drugs are mainly used in adults to lower plasma
cholesterol levels but also are sometimes administered to adolescents, particularly in familial cases of hypercholesterolemia. Statins
lower the patient’s levels of coenzyme-­Q10, which is needed for
mitochondrial electron transport. Myalgias are usually well tolerated, whereas myopathy requires stopping the statin. The immune-­
mediated muscle necrosis requires immune suppression with
prednisone; steroid-­sparing agents included intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and rituximab.

MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION IN TOXIC
MYOPATHIES

Impaired mitochondrial function, enzymatic activity in the five
respiratory chain complexes, and alterations in the mitochondrial ultrastructure are a common basis for the clinical effects of
many toxic organic compounds and heavy metals that affect both

muscle and peripheral nerves. Statin toxicity is mentioned previously. Another example is excessive zinc intake as a dietary supplement (see Chapter 654). These acquired, induced mitochondrial
cytopathies can produce weakness and resemble the clinical progression of genetic mitochondrial myopathies plus neuropathy.

CRITICAL ILLNESS MYOPATHY

Patients who are in the intensive care unit for extended periods sometimes develop progressive weakness and myalgias that cannot be attributed simply to disuse atrophy. The pathogenesis remains uncertain, but
some factors may include inhibition of protein synthesis, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and disruption of intramuscular
calcium homeostasis. Patients with severe disease may even develop
rhabdomyolysis, with elevated serum CK and myoglobinuria leading
to renal damage.

Metabolic Myopathies
and Channelopathies*
651.1 Periodic Paralyses and Other Muscle
Channelopathies
Adnan Y. Manzur
Episodic, reversible weakness or paralysis, known as periodic paralysis,
is associated with transient alterations in serum potassium levels, usually hypokalemia but occasionally hyperkalemia. All familial forms of
periodic paralysis are caused by pathogenic variants in genes encoding
voltage-­gated ion channels in muscle: sodium, calcium, and potassium
(Table 651.1). Nonhereditary causes of periodic paralysis are caused by
a diverse group of disorders that affect potassium balance (Table 651.2).
During attacks of hypokalemic paralysis, myofibers are electrically
unexcitable, although the contractile apparatus can respond normally
to calcium. The genetic disorder is inherited as an autosomal dominant
trait. It is precipitated in some patients by a heavy carbohydrate meal,
insulin, epinephrine including that induced by emotional stress, hyperaldosteronism or hyperthyroidism, administration of amphotericin B,
or ingestion of licorice.
Episodes of hypokalemic paralysis often begin in infancy, particularly in the hyperkalemic form, and the disease is nearly always symptomatic by 10 years of age, affecting both sexes equally. Late childhood
or adolescence is the more typical age of onset of the hypokalemic
form, Andersen-­Tawil syndrome, and paramyotonia congenita. Periodic paralysis is an episodic event; patients are unable to move after
awakening and gradually recover muscle strength during the next
few minutes or hours. All four extremities are involved. Muscles that
remain active in sleep, such as the diaphragm, extraocular muscles
(rapid eye movements), and cardiac muscle are not affected. Patients
are normal between episodes, but in adult life episodes become more
frequent, and the disorder causes progressive myopathy with permanent weakness even between episodes. The usual frequency of episodes in childhood is once a week. The differential diagnosis includes
thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, myotonia congenita, and paramyotonia congenita. A triad of periodic paralysis, potentially fatal cardiac
ventricular ectopy (caused by a defect in Kir2.1 channels for terminal repolarization), and characteristic physical features is known as
Andersen-­Tawil syndrome.
Alterations in serum potassium levels occur only during acute
episodes and are accompanied by T-­wave changes in the electrocardiogram. Hypokalemia may be caused by alterations in calcium gradients. The creatine kinase (CK) level may be mildly elevated at those
times. Plasma phosphate levels often decrease during symptomatic
periods. Muscle biopsy findings are often normal between episodes,
but during an episode a vacuolar myopathy is demonstrated. Pathologic changes in the periodic paralyses are similar, whether the disease
is the result of a sodium or a potassium channel defect, suggesting
that the changes might result from the recurrent paralytic state rather
than the specific channelopathy. The vacuoles are dilated sarcoplasmic reticulum and invaginations of the extracellular space into the
cytoplasm, and they may be filled with glycogen. Muscle biopsy is

not essential to diagnose periodic paralysis, however. Hypoglycemia
does not occur. Loci for the majority of periodic paralyses have been
demonstrated and the genes at least partially characterized, but many
patients with the same clinical phenotype exhibit no variants in the
identified genes.

TREATMENT

Paralytic episodes of hypokalemic periodic paralysis are best treated by
the oral administration of potassium or even fruit juices that contain
potassium. A low sodium intake and the administration of acetazolamide, 5 mg/kg/day bid or tid as a starting dose, often is effective in
abolishing episodes or at least reducing their frequency and severity.
Dichlorphenamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is approved for the
treatment of primary hypokalemic and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis syndromes in adults. The drug reduced the frequency, with few side
effects (paresthesias, confusion, dysgeusia). Acetazolamide has also
been used off label for these conditions.

OTHER MUSCLE CHANNELOPATHIES

Disorders of ion channels other than the well-­documented potassium channelopathies also are recognized (see Table 651.1). A rare,
severe neonatal myotonia is secondary to a pathologic variant of the
voltage-­gated sodium channel SCN4A gene; it is unrelated to neonatal myotonic dystrophy, myotonia congenita, or infantile myofibrillar
myopathies. This same gene is also responsible for severe neonatal episodic laryngospasm. Mexiletine is effective treatment of the myotonia,
but the long-­term prognosis remains poor, with death by 2 years of
age. Sodium channel blockers, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and
procainamide, are alternatives.
Neuromyotonia, a continuous muscle activity of neurogenic origin,
may be caused by pathogenic variants in genes encoding or antibodies
against potassium channels, but is rare in childhood. Schwartz-­Jampel
disease, resulting from an autosomal recessive trait, involves severe
muscle stiffness, myotonia, blepharospasm, and chondrodysplasia. It
becomes symptomatic in the first year of life and is slowly progressive
until midadolescence, after which it is stable. It is no longer considered a variant of myotonic dystrophy and is caused by a pathogenic
variant in HSPG2 which encodes perlecan, the major heparan sulfate

proteoglycan of basement membranes. Sodium channel blockers may
be useful.

651.2 Malignant Hyperthermia
Adnan Y. Manzur
See also Chapters 91 and 648.4.
Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) is usually inherited as
an autosomal dominant trait. It occurs in all patients with RYR1-­related
central core disease but is not limited to that particular myopathy. The
RYR1 is at the 19q13.1 locus and is responsible for both central core
disease and MHS without this specific myopathy. At least 180 separate pathogenic variants in this gene are associated with malignant
hyperthermia. The gene programs the ryanodine receptor, a tetrameric
calcium-­release channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, in apposition
to the voltage-­gated calcium channel of the transverse tubule (see
Table 651.1). RYR1 variants account for up to 75% of cases of malignant hyperthermia reactions. A similar rhabdomyolytic, but not true
malignant hyperthermia, reaction occurs rarely in Duchenne and
other muscular dystrophies. CACNA1S variants are a cause of periodic
paralysis but rarely some variance in this gene is associated with MHS.
Malignant hyperthermia is also a key risk in STAC3-­related congenital
myopathy, which was initially described in Native American Indians,
but has been reported in multiple ethnicities. The key features of STAC3
disease, also called Bailey-­Bloch congenital myopathy, are myopathy
with cleft palate, skeletal anomalies, delayed motor development, and
MHS. MHS has also been observed in various other myopathies, in
some children with scoliosis, and in an isolated syndrome not associated with other muscle disease. Affected children sometimes have
peculiar facies, described in King Denborough syndrome. MHS is
present in affected individuals at all ages, including premature infants
whose mothers underwent general anesthesia for cesarean section.
Overall, MHS affects 1:10,000 to 1:250,000, but prevalence of genetic
abnormalities may be as high as 1:400.
Acute malignant hyperthermia episodes are precipitated by exposure
to general anesthetics, and in particular the depolarizing muscle relaxant succinylcholine and halogenated inhaled anesthetic gases. Patients
suddenly develop extreme fever, rigidity of muscles, masseter muscle
spasm and metabolic and respiratory acidosis; the serum CK level rises
massively and sometimes over 30,000 IU/L. Life-­threatening hyperkalemia is a major risk. Myoglobinuria can result in tubular necrosis and
acute renal failure.
The muscle biopsy specimen obtained during an episode of malignant hyperthermia or shortly afterward is not indicated but shows
widely scattered necrosis of muscle fibers known as rhabdomyolysis.
Between attacks, the muscle biopsy specimen is normal unless there is
an underlying chronic myopathy.
It is important to recognize patients at risk of malignant hyperthermia because the attacks may be prevented by administering dantrolene
sodium before an anesthetic is given. Patients at risk, such as siblings,
are identified by genetic testing or by the caffeine contracture test: a
portion of fresh muscle biopsy tissue in a saline bath is attached to a
strain gauge and exposed to caffeine and other drugs; an abnormal
spasm is diagnostic. The syndrome-­associated receptor also may be
demonstrated by immunochemistry in frozen sections of the muscle
biopsy. The gene defect of the ryanodine receptor is present in 50% of
patients; gene testing is available for this and for STAC3-­related myopathy and MHS. Four other gene loci for MHS are known.
Apart from the genetic disorder of malignant hyperthermia, some
drugs can induce acute rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria and
potential renal failure, but this usually occurs in patients who are
predisposed by some other metabolic disease (mitochondrial myopathies). Valproic acid can induce this process in children with mitochondrial cytopathies or with carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT)
deficiency.

651.3 Glycogenoses
Adnan Y. Manzur
See Chapter 107.1 and Table 651.3.
Glycogenosis I (von Gierke disease) is not a true myopathy because
the deficient liver enzyme glucose-­6-­phosphatase is not normally present in muscle. Nevertheless, children with this disease are hypotonic
and mildly weak for unknown reasons.
Glycogenosis II (Pompe disease) is an autosomal recessively inherited deficiency of the glycolytic lysosomal enzyme α-­glucosidase
(formerly known as acid maltase) that cleaves the α-­1,4 and α-­1,6 glycosidic linkages. Of the 12 known glycogenoses, type II is the only
one with a defective lysosomal enzyme. The defective gene is at locus
17q23, with more than 200 distinct variants. Two clinical forms are
described. The infantile form is a severe generalized myopathy and
cardiomyopathy. Patients have cardiomegaly and hepatomegaly and
are diffusely hypotonic and weak. The serum CK level is greatly elevated. A muscle biopsy specimen reveals a vacuolar myopathy with
abnormal lysosomal enzymatic activities such as acid and alkaline
phosphatases. Evidence of secondary mitochondrial cytopathy is
often demonstrated; it includes electron microscopic demonstration
of paracrystalline structures within muscle mitochondria and low
concentrations of respiratory chain enzymes. Death in infancy or
early childhood is usual; however, enzyme replacement therapy has
improved the outcome.
The late childhood or adult form is a much milder myopathy without cardiac or hepatic enlargement. It might not become clinically
expressed until later childhood or early adult life but may be symptomatic as myopathic weakness and hypotonia even in early infancy.
Even in late adult-­onset acid maltase deficiency, >50% of the patients
report difficulties with muscle strength dating from childhood. Ultrastructural evidence of secondary mitochondrial cytopathy also occurs,
as with infantile Pompe disease. MRI of muscle may show distinctive
changes that differ from other myopathies.
The serum CK level is greatly elevated, and the muscle biopsy findings are diagnostic even in the presymptomatic stage. The diagnosis of
glycogenosis II is confirmed by quantitative assay of acid maltase activity in muscle or liver biopsy specimens.
A rare variant of the milder form of acid maltase deficiency can show
muscle acid maltase activity in the low normal range with only intermittent decreases to subnormal values; the muscle biopsy findings are
similar although milder. In another form, Danon disease, transmitted
as an X-­linked recessive trait at the Xq24 locus, the primary deficiency
is lysosomal membrane protein-­2 (LAMP2) and results in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, proximal myopathy, and intellectual disability.
Glycogenosis III (Cori-­Forbes disease), a deficiency of debrancher
enzyme (amylo-­1,6-­glucosidase), is more common than is usually diagnosed, and it is generally the least severe. Hypotonia, weakness, hepatomegaly, and fasting hypoglycemia in infancy are common, but these
features often resolve spontaneously, and patients become asymptomatic in childhood and adult life. Others experience slowly progressive
distal muscle wasting, hepatic cirrhosis, recurrent hypoglycemia, and
heart failure. This more serious chronic course is particularly seen in
the Inuit population. Minor myopathic findings including vacuolation
of muscle fibers are found in the muscle biopsy specimen.
Glycogenosis IV (Andersen disease) is a deficiency of brancher
enzyme, resulting in the formation of an abnormal glycogen molecule, amylopectin, in the liver, reticuloendothelial cells, and skeletal

and cardiac muscle. Hypotonia, generalized weakness, muscle wasting, and contractures are the usual signs of myopathic involvement.
Most patients die before age 4 years because of hepatic or cardiac failure. A few children without neuromuscular manifestations have been
described.
Glycogenosis V (McArdle disease) is caused by muscle glycogen
phosphorylase deficiency inherited as an autosomal recessive trait at
locus 11q13, encoded by PMGM. Exercise intolerance is the cardinal
clinical feature. Physical exertion results in cramps, weakness, and
myoglobinuria, but strength is normal between attacks. The serum CK
level is elevated only during exercise. A characteristic clinical feature
is lack of the normal rise in serum lactate levels during ischemic exercise because of inability to convert pyruvate to lactate under anaerobic
conditions in vivo. Myophosphorylase deficiency may be demonstrated histochemically and biochemically in the muscle biopsy tissue.
Some patients have a defect in adenosine monophosphate–dependent
muscle phosphorylase β-­kinase, a phosphorylase enzyme activator.
Muscle phosphorylase deficiency can be diagnosed by MR spectroscopy, which shows that the intramuscular pH does not decrease with
exercise and there is no depletion of adenosine triphosphatase but that
the phosphocreatine concentration falls excessively. This noninvasive
technique may be useful in some patients if the radiologist is experienced with the disease.
A rare neonatal form of myophosphorylase deficiency causes
feeding difficulties in early infancy, may be severe enough to result in
neonatal death, or can follow a course of slowly progressive weakness
resembling a muscular dystrophy. The long-­term prognosis is good.
Patients must learn to moderate their physical activities, but they do not
develop severe chronic myopathic handicaps or cardiac involvement.
Glycogenosis VII (Tarui disease) is muscle phosphofructokinase
deficiency. Although this disease is rarer than glycogenosis V, the
symptoms of exercise intolerance, clinical course, and inability to convert pyruvate to lactate are identical. The distinction is made by biochemical study of the muscle biopsy specimen. It is transmitted as an
autosomal recessive trait at the 1cenq32 locus, and some gene variants
are particularly prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.

651.4 Mitochondrial Myopathies
Adnan Y. Manzur
See also Chapters 107.4 and 638.2 and Table 651.4.
Several diseases involving muscle, brain, and other organs are associated with structural and functional abnormalities of mitochondria,
producing defects in aerobic cellular metabolism, the electron transport chain, and the Krebs cycle (see Table 651.4; Table 651.5). Because
mitochondria are found in all cells except mature erythrocytes, the
term mitochondrial cytopathy is used preferentially to emphasize the
multisystemic nature of these diseases. The structural aberrations are
best demonstrated by electron microscopy of the muscle biopsy sample, revealing a proliferation of abnormally shaped cristae, including
stacked or whorled cristae and paracrystalline structures that occupy
the space between cristae and are formed from CK. Muscle biopsies
of neonates, infants, and toddlers show more severe involvement of
endothelial cells of intramuscular capillaries than of myofibers, unlike
the reverse in adults, but endothelial paracrystalline structures are
globular rather than brick shaped as in myofibers. The endoplasmic
reticulum becomes abnormally adherent to mitochondria. Similar
endothelial mitochondrial alterations are seen in the brain in Leigh and
other infantile mitochondrial encephalopathies. Histochemical study
of the muscle biopsy specimen reveals abnormal clumping of oxidative
enzymatic activity and scattered myofibers, with loss of cytochromec oxidase activity and with increased neutral lipids within myofibers.
Ragged red muscle fibers occur in some mitochondrial myopathies,
particularly those with a combination of respiratory chain complexes
I and IV deficiencies. Accumulations of this membranous material
­

Dantrolene sodium is a specific treatment or preventive if administered to patients at risk before an anesthetic. The pediatrician has
a crucial role in identifying the potential MHS, conveying the risk
to the anesthetist, and a malignant hyperthermia safe protocol with
total intravenous anesthetic is recommended for suspected or proven
cases.

beneath the muscle fiber membrane are best demonstrated by special
stains, such as modified Gomori trichrome.
These characteristic histochemical and ultrastructural changes
are most consistently seen with point pathogenic variants in mitochondrial transfer RNA. The large mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
deletions of 5 kb or 7.4 kb (the single mitochondrial chromosome
has 16.5 kb) are associated with defects in mitochondrial respiratory oxidative enzyme complexes, if as few as 2% of the mitochondria are affected, but minimal or no morphologic or histochemical

changes may be noted in the muscle biopsy specimen, even by electron microscopy. Hence, quantitative biochemical studies of the muscle tissue are needed to confirm the diagnosis. Because most of the
subunits of the respiratory chain complexes are encoded by nuclear
DNA (nDNA) rather than mtDNA, mendelian autosomal inheritance
is possible, rather than maternal transmission as with pure mtDNA
point variants. Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) is the only
enzyme complex in which all of its subunits are encoded by nDNA; it
is histochemically reactive in all mitochondrial diseases with mtDNA

point variants. Serum lactate is elevated in some diseases, and cerebrospinal fluid lactate is more consistently elevated, even if serum
concentrations are normal.
The term primary mitochondrial myopathies encompasses the
group of genetic disorders where pathophysiology is impaired oxidative
phosphorylation and the primary affected organ is the skeletal muscle.
Several distinct or overlapping mitochondrial syndromes that primarily affect striated muscle or muscle and brain are identified. These can
be divided clinically, or histopathologically, into the ragged red fiber
diseases and non–ragged fiber diseases. The ragged red fiber diseases

include Kearns-­Sayre, MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic
acidosis, and strokelike episodes) syndrome, MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers) syndrome, and progressive external ophthalmoplegia syndromes, which are associated with a combined defect
in respiratory chain complexes I and IV. The non–ragged fiber diseases
include Leigh encephalopathy and Leber hereditary optic atrophy;
they involve complex I or IV alone or, in children, the common combination of defective complexes III and V. Kearns-­Sayre syndrome is
characterized by the triad of progressive external ophthalmoplegia,
pigmentary degeneration of the retina, and onset before age 20 years.
Heart block, cerebellar deficits, and a high cerebrospinal fluid protein
content are often associated. Visual evoked potentials are abnormal.
Patients usually do not experience weakness of the trunk or extremities
or dysphagia. Most cases are sporadic.
Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia may be isolated or
accompanied by limb muscle weakness, dysphagia, and dysarthria. A
few patients described as having ophthalmoplegia plus have additional
central nervous system involvement. Autosomal dominant inheritance
is found in some pedigrees, but most cases are sporadic.
MERRF and MELAS syndromes are other mitochondrial disorders
affecting children. The latter is characterized by stunted growth, episodic vomiting, seizures, and recurring cerebral insults causing hemiparesis, hemianopia, or even cortical blindness, and dementia. The
disease behaves as a degenerative disorder, and children die within a
few years.
Other diseases of the central nervous system that also involve myopathy with mitochondrial abnormalities include Leigh subacute necrotizing encephalopathy (see Chapter 107.4) and cerebrohepatorenal
(Zellweger) disease, primarily a peroxisomal disease with secondary
mitochondrial alterations (see Chapter 106.2). Another recognized
mitochondrial myopathy is cytochrome-­c oxidase deficiency. Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy is also fundamentally a mitochondrial myopathy.
Mitochondrial depletion syndrome of early infancy is characterized by severely decreased oxidative enzymatic activities in most
or all five of the complexes; in addition to diffuse muscle weakness,
neonates and young infants can show multisystemic involvement,
and the syndrome occurs in several forms: myopathic, encephalomyopathic, hepatoencephalopathic, and intestinal encephalopathic.
Cardiomyopathy and sometimes bullous skin lesions or generalized
edema also can occur.
One myopathic subgroup of mtDNA maintenance defect is related
to the TK2 gene, which encodes for thymidine kinase 2. The clinical
presentation is with floppy infant and childhood-­onset progressive
limb and bulbar myopathy with restrictive lung disease and respiratory
failure. The TK2 enzyme phosphorylates nucleosides in the pathway to
generate deoxynucleoside triphosphates required for mtDNA replication and maintenance. Raised serum CK together with raised plasma

lactate is a good diagnostic clue, and the diagnosis can be confirmed
by documenting autosomal recessive variants in the TK2 gene. This
group is of particular interest because of the potential for treatment
with pyrimidine deoxynucleosides.
Alpers syndrome is genetically homogeneous and is caused by
mtDNA depletion and variants in the POLG1 gene. Several other genes
are identified, mostly in later-­onset forms; hence, mitochondrial depletion is a syndrome and not a single disease. Barth syndrome is an
X-­linked recessive mitochondrial disorder characterized by cardiomyopathy, myopathy of striated muscle, growth retardation, neutropenia,
and high serum and urinary concentrations of 3-­methyl-­glutaconic
acid.
Many rare diseases with only a few case reports are suspected of
being mitochondrial disorders. It is also now recognized that secondary mitochondrial defects occur in a wide range of nonmitochondrial
diseases, including inflammatory autoimmune myopathies, Pompe
disease, and some cerebral malformations, and also may be induced
by certain drugs and toxins, so that interpretation of mitochondrial
abnormalities as primary defects must be approached with caution.

a good screening measurement; it rarely is increased in other metabolic
diseases. This product may also be increased in urine. Hepatic enzymes
(transaminases) should be measured in blood. Cardiac evaluation is
often warranted. Molecular markers in blood for the common diseases
with known mtDNA point variants identify many of the mitochondrial
cytopathies presenting in adult life or adolescence, but less frequently
in children and least in young infants. MRI of the brain may reveal
hyperintense lesions of the basal ganglia and MR spectroscopy can
demonstrate an increased lactate peak. The muscle biopsy provides
the best evidence of all mitochondrial myopathies and should include
histochemistry for oxidative enzymes, electron microscopy, and quantitative biochemical assay of respiratory chain enzyme complexes and
coenzyme Q10; muscle tissue also can be analyzed for mtDNA. Many
mitochondrial disorders also can affect the Schwann cells and axons of
peripheral nerves and present clinically with neuropathy; hence, motor
and sensory nerve conduction velocities can be measured in selected
patients. Sural nerve biopsy is required only rarely if neuropathy is
the predominant finding, and the diagnosis is not evident from other
studies.
A diagnostic approach is noted in Figure 651.1.

INVESTIGATIONS

TREATMENT

Investigation for mitochondrial cytopathies begins with serum lactate.
Lactic acid is not increased in all mitochondrial cytopathies, so that a
normal result is not necessarily reassuring; cerebrospinal fluid lactate is
increased in some cases in which serum lactate is normal, particularly if
there are clinical signs of encephalopathy. Serum 3-­methyl-­glutaconic
acid often is increased in mitochondrial cytopathies in general, demonstrated in more than 50 different genetic pathogenic variants, and is

There is no effective treatment for majority of the mitochondrial cytopathies, but various cocktails are often used to try to overcome the metabolic deficits (see Chapter 638.2).

651.5 Lipid Myopathies
Adnan Y. Manzur
See Chapter 106.4.
Skeletal muscles are the most important sites in the body for
long-­chain fatty acid metabolism because of their large mass and
their rich density of mitochondria where fatty acids are metabolized. Fatty acids are the major source of energy for skeletal muscle
during sustained exercise or fasting. Hereditary disorders of lipid
metabolism that cause progressive myopathy are an important,
relatively common, and often treatable group of muscle diseases
(Table 651.6). Increased lipid within myofibers is seen in the muscle biopsy of some mitochondrial myopathies and is a constant,
rather than an unpredictable, feature of specific diseases. Among
the ragged red fiber diseases, Kearns-­Sayre syndrome always shows
increased neutral lipid, whereas MERRF and MELAS syndromes do
not, a useful diagnostic marker for the pathologist. Free fatty acids
are converted to acyl-­coenzyme A by fatty acyl-­coenzyme A synthetases; the resulting long-­chain fatty acids bind to carnitine and
are transported into mitochondria where β-­oxidation is carried out.
Disorders of lipid fuel utilization and lipid storage disorders can be
divided into defects of transport and oxidation of exogenous fatty
acids within mitochondria and defects of endogenous triglyceride
catabolism.
Muscle carnitine deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease
caused by pathologic variants in the SLC22A5 gene, involving deficient transport of dietary carnitine across the intestinal mucosa.
Carnitine is acquired from dietary sources but is also synthesized
in the liver and kidneys from lysine and methionine; it is the obligatory carrier of long-­and medium-­chain fatty acids into muscle
mitochondria.
The clinical course may be one of sudden exacerbations of weakness or can resemble a progressive muscular dystrophy with generalized proximal myopathy and sometimes facial, pharyngeal, and cardiac
involvement. Symptoms usually begin in late childhood or adolescence
or may be delayed until adult life. Progression is slow but can end in
death.
The serum CK level is mildly elevated. Muscle biopsy material
shows vacuoles filled with lipid within muscle fibers in addition
to nonspecific changes suggestive of a muscular dystrophy. Mitochondria can appear normal or abnormal. Carnitine measured in
muscle biopsy tissue is reduced, but the serum carnitine level is
normal.
Treatment stops the progression of the disease and can even
restore lost strength if the disease is not too advanced. It consists
of special diets low in long-­chain fatty acids. Steroids can enhance
fatty acid transport. Specific therapy with l-­carnitine taken orally
in large doses overcomes the intestinal barrier in some patients.
Some patients also improve when given supplementary riboflavin,
and other patients seem to improve with propranolol.
Systemic carnitine deficiency is a disease of impaired renal and
hepatic synthesis of carnitine rather than a primary myopathy.
Patients with this autosomal recessive disease experience progressive proximal myopathy and show muscle biopsy changes similar to
those of muscle carnitine deficiency; the onset of weakness is earlier and may be evident at birth. Endocardial fibroelastosis can also
occur. Episodes of acute hepatic encephalopathy resembling Reye

syndrome can occur. Hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis complicate acute episodes. Cardiomyopathy may be the predominating
feature in some cases and result in death.
Cerebral infarctions and myopathy occur in children, particularly when accompanied by hypoglycemia. The mean age at presentation is approximately 9 years. A brain MRI shows distinctive
changes related to multiple infarcts of various sizes.
The concentration of carnitine is reduced in serum as well as in muscle and liver. l-­Carnitine deficiency can be corrected by oral administration of carnitine on a daily basis.
A similar clinical syndrome may be a complication of renal Fanconi
syndrome because of excessive urinary loss of carnitine or loss during
chronic hemodialysis.
Treatment with l-­carnitine improves the maintenance of blood glucose and serum carnitine levels but does not reverse the ketosis or acidosis or improve the exercise capacity.
Muscle CPT deficiency manifests as episodes of cramps after
exercise, rhabdomyolysis, coma, and elevated serum CK levels. It
is the most commonly identified cause of recurrent myoglobinuria
in adults, but myoglobinuria is not a constant feature. CPT transfers long-­chain fatty acid acyl-­coenzyme A residues to carnitine
on the outer mitochondrial membrane for transport into the mitochondria. Exercise intolerance and myoglobinuria resemble glycogenoses V and VII. The degree of exercise that triggers an attack
varies among individuals, ranging from casual walking to strenuous
exercise. Fasting hypoglycemia can occur. Some patients present
only in late adolescence or adult life with myalgias. Genetic transmission is autosomal recessive and is caused by a defect on chromosome 1 at the 1p32 locus. Administration of valproic acid can
precipitate acute rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria in patients
with CPT deficiency; it should be avoided in the treatment of seizures or migraine if they occur. Treatment includes a low fat, high
carbohydrate diet. Very long-­chain acyl-­coenzyme A dehydrogenase
deficiency has a similar clinical presentation but mainly with adult
onset.

651.6 Vitamin E Deficiency Myopathy
Adnan Y. Manzur
Deficiency of vitamin E (α-­tocopherol, an antioxidant also important in mitochondrial superoxide generation) may produce a
progressive myopathy closely resembling a muscular dystrophy.
Myopathy and neuropathy are recognized in humans who lack
adequate intake of this antioxidant. Patients with chronic malabsorption, those undergoing long-­term dialysis, and premature
infants who do not receive vitamin E supplements are particularly
vulnerable. Treatment with high doses of vitamin E can reverse the
deficiency. Myopathy caused by chronic hypervitaminosis E also
occurs.

Disorders of
Neuromuscular
Transmission and of
Motor Neurons*
652.1 Myasthenia Gravis
Adnan Y. Manzur

AUTOIMMUNE MYASTHENIA GRAVIS

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the postsynaptic end plate leading to abnormal neuromuscular transmission
or blockade, characterized clinically by rapid fatigability of striated
muscle, particularly extraocular and palpebral muscles and those of
swallowing. It must be distinguished from congenital myasthenic syndrome, a genetic disorder of receptors on the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, as well as the synapse of the neuromuscular junction
and toxin-­induced disorders of neurotransmission, such as botulism
(see later). In MG, the release of acetylcholine (ACh) into the synaptic cleft by the axonal terminal is normal, but the postsynaptic muscle
membrane (i.e., sarcolemma) or motor end plate is less responsive than
normal. This is due to antibodies against the postsynaptic acetylcholine
receptor (AChR), leading to an abnormal architecture/folding pattern
of the postsynaptic membrane, as well as a decreased number of receptors to which ACh can bind.
Infants born to myasthenic mothers can have a transient neonatal myasthenic syndrome secondary to placentally transferred anti-­
AChR antibodies, distinct from congenital myasthenic syndromes
(Tables 652.1-­652.3).

Clinical Manifestations

The age of onset for immune-­mediated MG ranges anywhere from
11 months to 17 years of age. In the prepubertal age-­groups, the
female:male ratio is about 1.5:1, and in the postpubertal age-­groups,
the female:male ratio is about 1:1 (Table 652.4). In juvenile autoimmune MG, unilateral or bilateral but usually asymmetric ptosis and
some degree of extraocular muscle weakness are the earliest and most
constant signs. Extraocular weakness is not confined to muscles innervated by just one or two of the three corresponding brainstem nuclei; it
is progressive. Older children might complain of diplopia, and young
children might hold open their eyes with their fingers or thumbs if
the ptosis is severe enough to obstruct vision. Pupillary responses to
light are preserved. Dysphagia and facial weakness also are common
and, in early infancy, feeding difficulties are frequent as the cardinal
sign of myasthenia; in severe cases, aspiration and airway obstruction
may occur. Poor head control because of weakness of the neck flexors
may be prominent. Involvement initially may appear to be limited to
bulbar-­innervated muscles, but the disease can be systemic and progressive weakness eventually involves limb-­girdle muscles and distal
muscles of the hands in many cases. Fasciculations of muscle, myalgias,
and sensory symptoms do not occur. Tendon stretch reflexes may be
diminished but rarely are lost. Ocular MG may prove to be transitory
over time, but in some patients, weakness never progresses to involve the
axial or appendicular muscles. This disorder accounts for approximately
25% of all juvenile MG patients and is most frequent in children of
Chinese and southeastern Asian descent, suggesting an ethnic genetic

predisposition. In addition, prepubertal patients are more likely to have
ocular only myasthenia, whereas a majority of postpubertal patients
with myasthenia will have generalized symptoms.
Rapid fatigue of muscles is a characteristic feature of MG that distinguishes it from most other neuromuscular diseases. Ptosis increases
progressively as patients are asked to sustain an upward gaze for 30-­90
seconds. Holding the head up from the surface of the examining table
while lying supine is very difficult (indicative of neck flexion weakness), and gravity cannot be overcome for more than a few seconds.
Repetitive opening and closing of the fists produces rapid fatigue of
hand muscles, and patients cannot elevate their arms for more than
1-­2 minutes because of fatigue of the deltoids. Patients are more symptomatic late in the day or when tired. Dysphagia can interfere with
eating, and the muscles of the jaw soon tire when an affected child
chews. Reviewing activities of daily living helps determine the severity of symptoms (Table 652.5). Additional triggers for exacerbation of
weakness may include heat and intercurrent illness. Application of cold
packs over the eyes will reverse ptosis.
Left untreated, MG is usually progressive and can become life-­
threatening because of respiratory muscle involvement and the risk of
aspiration, particularly at times when the child is otherwise unwell, as
during an upper respiratory tract infection. Familial myasthenia (congenital myasthenic syndrome) usually is not progressive, but may vary
in severity from milder forms, limb-­girdle forms, to more severe forms,
including those with respiratory failure.
Myasthenic crisis is an acute or subacute severe increase in weakness in patients with MG, usually precipitated by an intercurrent infection, surgery, or even emotional stress. It may require intravenous
cholinesterase inhibitors, immunoglobulin, plasma exchange, gavage
feeding, and even transient ventilator support. It must be distinguished
from cholinergic crisis secondary to overdosing with anticholinesterase medications. The muscarinic effects include abdominal cramps,
diarrhea, profuse sweating, salivation, bradycardia, increased weakness, and miosis. Cholinergic crisis requires only supportive care and
withholding of further doses of cholinergic drugs, and it passes within
a few hours; the dose of medication to be restarted should be reconsidered, unless the patient had taken an overdose that was not prescribed.
Approximately 70–80% of adolescents with immune-­mediated MG
will have elevated AChR antibodies, but anti-­AChR antibodies are only
occasionally demonstrated in the plasma of prepubertal children. Some
with negative titers of anticholinesterase exhibit anti–muscle-­specific
tyrosine kinase (MuSK) circulating antibodies. MuSK is localized at
the neuromuscular junction and appears essential to fetal development
of this junction. Additional autoantibodies related to immune MG
include LRP4, titin, and ryanodine receptor (RyR) antibodies. In some
patients, no antibody is detected (unknown MG etiology).
Infants born to myasthenic mothers can have respiratory insufficiency, inability to suck or swallow, and generalized hypotonia and
weakness, a syndrome typically referred to as transient neonatal myasthenia. They might show little spontaneous motor activity for several
days to weeks. The onset of symptoms typically occurs within the first
1-­3 days of life. Some require ventilatory support and feeding by gavage
during this period. Some patients may also require pyridostigmine
(acetylcholinesterase [AChE] inhibitor) management transiently. After
the abnormal antibodies disappear from the blood and muscle tissue,
these infants regain normal strength and are not at increased risk of
developing MG in later childhood. Patients usually show full recovery by about 2 months of age. A small minority develops fetal akinesia
sequence with multiple joint contractures (arthrogryposis) that develop
in utero from lack of fetal movement. AChR antibodies can usually be
demonstrated in maternal blood, but at times maternal antibodies may
not be detected. Rates of transient neonatal myasthenia are estimated
to be as high as 10–20% of infants born to mothers with MG.

CONGENITAL MYASTHENIC SYNDROMES

A heterogeneous group of genetic diseases of neuromuscular transmission is collectively called congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMSs).
The etiology and pathogenesis of these syndromes are unrelated to
either transitory neonatal myasthenia caused by placental transfer of

Most (about 85%) patients with myasthenia gravis have acetylcholine receptor autoantibodies. MuSK, LRP4, and agrin antibody-­positive myasthenia gravis variants are much less prevalent (about 5%, 2%, and <1% of patients with myasthenia gravis,
respectively). About 8% of patients with myasthenia gravis are seronegative for all these antibodies. About 15% of patients with Lambert-­Eaton myasthenia gravis are seronegative (i.e., they have no detectable VGCC antibodies). Class I direct evidence:
Patient antibodies are pathogenic upon passive transfer to animals or upon application in in vitro models. Class II indirect evidence: Active immunization with the antigen causes a myasthenia gravis phenotype in animals or transplacental transfer causes a
temporary phenotype
in children. Class III circumstantial evidence: Pathogenicity is expected based on the biological role of the antigen or positive response to immunosuppressive treatments, although direct experimental evidence is lacking. Gender bias refers to
overrepresentation of the syndrome in one of two sexes.

maternal antibodies or to autoimmune MG, despite overlap of clinical
symptoms. CMSs are nearly always permanent static disorders without spontaneous remission (see Table 652.1). Several distinct genetic
forms are recognized, nearly all with onset at birth or in early infancy
with symptoms that may include hypotonia, external ophthalmoplegia,
ptosis, dysphagia, weak cry, facial weakness, easy muscle fatigue generally, and sometimes respiratory insufficiency or failure, the last often
precipitated by a minor respiratory infection. In the childhood-­onset
forms, findings such as fatigability, delayed motor milestones, and fluctuating ocular symptoms (ptosis and extraocular muscle weakness) are
common. Cholinesterase inhibitors have a favorable effect in most, but
in some forms the symptoms and signs are actually worsened. Children
with most types of congenital MG do not experience myasthenic crises
and rarely exhibit elevations of anti-­ACh antibodies in plasma.
Pathologic gene variants responsible for CMS have been identified in
over 30 different genes. The genetic variants are known in less than half
of children with CMS. The most common genes associated with CMS
include CHAT, CHRNE, DOK7, COLQ, GFPT, and RAPSN. CMS can
be caused by pathogenic variants affecting proteins involved in ACh
synthesis, vesicle fusion into the synaptic cleft, ACh breakdown in the
synaptic cleft, and reuptake of choline, within subunits of the postsynaptic AChR, as well as in postsynaptic glycosylation pathways. Basal
lamina-­associated proteins can lead to synaptic cleft abnormalities due
to variants in the COLQ, COL13A1, and LAMB2 genes. These pathways
emphasize the role of the integrity of the extracellular matrix proteins
in the formation and maintenance of the synapse. Anti-­AChR and anti-­
MuSK antibodies are usually, but not always, absent in serum, unlike in
autoimmune forms of MG affecting older children and adults.
There may be clinical clues that aid in the diagnosis (see Tables 652.1
and 652.3). In patients with apneic episodes, consider RAPSN, CHAT,
and COLQ. Apneic episodes in patients with choline acyltransferase
(CHAT) variants can be episodic but can also be life-­threatening.
Although most CMS syndromes are inherited in a recessive fashion,
there are several in which an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance or de novo dominant pattern of inheritance can be seen, including CHRNA1, CHRNB1, CHRND, CHRNE, and SYT2. Variants in the
RAPSN gene can lead to an early-­onset hypotonia with respiratory
failure and episodic apnea but can also present in milder limb-­girdle
patterns of weakness with an onset in childhood or adolescence. Genes
associated with a more limb-­girdle myasthenic syndrome phenotype
include GFPT1, DPAGT1, ALG2, ALG14, GMPPB, and PREPL. Genes
affecting the postsynaptic AChR subunits may be associated with a
slow-­channel CMS in which patients may have variable weakness, typically with worsening with AChE inhibitors, as well as a fast-­channel

CMS syndrome; they can show improvement in symptoms in response
to AChE inhibitors.

RARE OTHER CAUSES OF MYASTHENIA

MG is occasionally associated with hypothyroidism, usually Hashimoto thyroiditis. Other collagen vascular diseases and also some
centronuclear myopathies may be associated with defects in neuromuscular transmission. Thymomas, noted in some adults, rarely
coexist with MG in children. Likewise, lung carcinomas that occur in
adults associated with Lambert-­Eaton myasthenic syndrome are not
seen in children. Lambert-­Eaton syndrome in children is rare but has
been reported with lymphoproliferative disorders and with neuroblastoma. Postinfectious MG in children is transitory and usually follows a
varicella-­zoster infection by 2-­5 weeks as an immune response.

Laboratory Findings and Diagnosis

MG is one of the few neuromuscular diseases in which electromyography (EMG) is more specifically diagnostic than a muscle or nerve
biopsy. A decremental response is seen to repetitive nerve stimulation;
the muscle potentials diminish rapidly in amplitude until the muscle
becomes refractory to further stimulation. Electrophysiologically, this
response is due to end plate potentials decreasing with subsequent
repetitive stimulations, such that stimuli no longer result in end plate
potentials that achieve a threshold resulting in a propagating motor
action potential. This results in a cumulative lowering of the compound
muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude with the repeated stimuli.
A decline of greater than 10% between waves 1 and 4 on repetitive stimulation is diagnostic for a decremental response, and suggestive of a
disorder of neuromuscular transmission. The motor nerve conduction
velocity remains normal. This unique EMG pattern is the electrophysiologic correlate of the fatigable weakness observed clinically and is
reversed after a cholinesterase inhibitor is administered. A myasthenic
decrement may be absent or difficult to demonstrate in muscles that are
not involved clinically. This feature may be confusing in early cases or
in patients showing only weakness of extraocular muscles. Stimulated
single-­fiber EMG methodology, when available, measures the variability in neuromuscular transmission as a value called jitter, and is highly
sensitive and moderately specific for neuromuscular junction transmission abnormality. Special electrophysiologic studies are required in
the classification of CMS and involve estimating the number of AChRs
per end plate and in vitro study of end plate function. These special
studies and patch-­clamp recordings of kinetic properties of channels
are performed on special biopsy samples of intercostal muscle strips
that include both the origin and insertion of the muscle but are only

performed in specialized centers. If myasthenia is limited to the extraocular, levator palpebrae, and pharyngeal muscles, repetitive nerve
stimulation of the distal and proximal muscles (e.g., abductor pollicis
brevis muscle or trapezius muscle, respectively), although diagnostic in
the generalized disease, is usually normal.
Anti-­AChR antibodies should be assayed in the plasma but are
inconsistently demonstrated. Antibodies against the MuSK receptor
should be sought in children without circulating AChR antibodies, a
diagnostic finding when elevated, which further delineates the etiology. Many cases of congenital MG result from failure to synthesize or
release ACh at the presynaptic membrane. In some cases, the gene that
mediates the enzyme choline acetyltransferase for the synthesis of ACh
is identified. In others, there is a defect in the quantal release of vesicles
containing ACh. The treatment of such patients with cholinesterase
inhibitors is not effective. In some patients, such as those with COLQ
and DOK7 variants as well as slow-­channel myasthenia, AChE inhibitors (e.g., pyridostigmine) can lead to no response or even worsening
of symptoms. Clinical genetic testing for CMS can be done by panels
that are commercially available and can test ∼14-­21 CMS-­associated
genes.
Other serologic tests of autoimmune disease, such as antinuclear
antibodies and abnormal immune complexes, should also be sought. If
these are positive, more extensive autoimmune disease involving vasculitis or tissues other than muscle is likely. A thyroid profile should
always be examined. The serum creatine kinase (CK) level is normal
in MG.
The heart is not involved, and electrocardiographic findings remain
normal. Radiographs of the chest often reveal an enlarged thymus,
but the hypertrophy is not a thymoma. It may be further defined by
CT or MRI of the anterior mediastinum if the radiographic findings
are uncertain, but caution should be used when selecting the optimal imaging modalities because of radiation exposure for CT and
anesthetic risk in a myasthenic patient if sedated MRI is needed for a
younger myasthenic child.
The role of conventional muscle biopsy in MG is limited. It is not
required in most cases, but approximately 17% of patients show inflammatory changes, sometimes called lymphorrhages, that are interpreted
by some physicians as a mixed myasthenia-­polymyositis immune disorder. Muscle biopsy tissue in MG shows a nonspecific type II muscle
fiber atrophy, similar to that seen with disuse atrophy, steroid effects
on muscle, polymyalgia rheumatica, and many other conditions. The
ultrastructure of motor end plates shows simplification of the membrane folds; the AChRs are located in these postsynaptic folds, as
shown by bungarotoxin (snake venom), which binds specifically to the
AChRs.
A clinical test for MG is administration of a short-­acting cholinesterase inhibitor, usually edrophonium chloride. Ptosis and ophthalmoplegia improve within a few seconds, and the fatigability of other muscles
decreases. The “edrophonium Tensilon test” should be undertaken with
extreme caution because of risk of bradyarrhythmias and syncope, and
it can cause paradoxical worsening of neuromuscular transmission in
COLQ-­related CMS. This test is now used rarely in centers where good
neurophysiology, antibody, and molecular genetic testing are readily
available.

Recommendations on the Use of Cholinesterase
Inhibitors as a Diagnostic Test for Myasthenia Gravis
in Infants and Children
Children 2 Years of Age and Older

• The child should have a specific fatigable weakness that can be measured, such as ptosis of the eyelids, dysphagia, or inability of the cervical muscles to support the head. Nonspecific generalized weakness
without cranial nerve motor deficits is not a criterion.
• This test is recommended to be undertaken on an intensive care unit
or high dependency unit setting where facilities for resuscitation are
available, in case of adverse reactions to edrophonium.
• An intravenous infusion of normal saline should be started to enable
the administration of medications in the event of an adverse reaction.
• Electrocardiographic monitoring is recommended during the test.
• A dose of atropine sulfate (0.01 mg/kg) should be available in a

syringe, ready for intravenous administration at the bedside during
the edrophonium test, to block acute muscarinic effects of the cholinesterase inhibitor, such as abdominal cramps and/or sudden diarrhea from increased peristalsis, profuse bronchotracheal secretions
that can obstruct the airway, or, rarely, cardiac arrhythmias. Some
physicians pretreat all patients with atropine before administering
edrophonium, but this is not recommended unless there is a history
of a reaction to tests. Atropine can cause the pupils to be dilated for
as long as 14 days after a single dose, and the pupillary effects of
homatropine can last 4-­7 days.
• Edrophonium chloride (Tensilon) is administered intravenously.
The initial test dose is 0.01 mg/kg (no more than 1 mg [for children <30 kg], and no more than 2 mg initial dose [for children >30
kg]). After the initial dose, repeat doses may be given intravenously.
For children <30 kg, repeat at a rate of 1 mg every 30-­45 seconds to
a maximum cumulative dose of 5 mg. For children >30 kg, repeat
doses of 1 mg every 30-­45 seconds to a maximum cumulative dose
of 10 mg. In adults, the average edrophonium dose to show positive responses is approximately 3.3 mg for ptosis and approximately
2.6 mg for oculomotor symptoms. Side effects include nausea and
emesis; light-­headedness from bradycardia (atropine is the antidote)
and bronchospasm are less common side effects. The edrophonium
test may be done by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection but
may require modification of dosing.
• Effects should be seen within 10 seconds and disappear within 120
seconds. Weakness is measured as, for example, the distance between
the upper and lower eyelids before and after administration, degree of
external ophthalmoplegia, or ability to swallow a sip of water.
• Long-­acting cholinesterase inhibitors, such as pyridostigmine (Mestinon), are generally not as useful for the acute assessment of myasthenic weakness. The neostigmine (Prostigmin) test may be used
(as outlined later) but might not be as definitively diagnostic as the
edrophonium test.
Children Younger Than 2 Years of Age

• Infants ideally should have a specific fatigable weakness that can be
measured, such as ptosis of the eyelids, dysphagia, and inability of
the cervical muscles to support the head. Nonspecific generalized
weakness without cranial nerve motor deficits makes it less easy to
assess results but may be a criterion at times.
• An intravenous line should be started as a rapid route for medications in the event of an adverse effect of the test medication.
• Electrocardiographic monitoring is recommended during the test.
• Pretreatment with atropine sulfate to block the muscarinic effects of
the test medication is not recommended, but atropine sulfate should
be available at the bedside in a prepared syringe. If needed, it should
be administered intravenously in a dose of 0.01 mg/kg.
• Edrophonium is not recommended for use in infants; its effect is too brief
for objective assessment, and an increased incidence of acute cardiac
arrhythmias is reported in infants, especially neonates, with this drug.
• Prostigmin methyl sulfate (neostigmine) is administered intramuscularly at a dose of 0.04 mg/kg. If the result is negative or equivocal,
another dose of 0.04 mg/kg may be administered 4 hours after the
first dose (a typical dose is 0.5-­1.5 mg). The peak effect is seen in
20-­40 minutes. Intravenous Prostigmin is contraindicated because
of the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including fatal ventricular fibrillation, especially in young infants.
• Long-­acting cholinesterase inhibitors administered orally, such as
pyridostigmine (Mestinon), are generally not as useful for the acute
assessment of myasthenic weakness because the onset and duration
are less predictable.
The test should be performed in the emergency department, hospital ward, or intensive care unit; the important issue is preparation
for potential complications such as cardiac arrhythmia or cholinergic
crisis, as outlined.

Treatment

Some patients with mild MG require no treatment. Cholinesterase-­
inhibiting drugs are the primary therapeutic agents. Pyridostigmine
bromide (Mestinon) may be given orally starting at 0.5-­1 mg/kg per

Chapter 652 u Disorders of Neuromuscular Transmission and of Motor Neurons
dose every 4-­6 hours while the patient is awake to a maximum of 60
mg per dose. The maximum daily recommended dose is 7 mg/kg/day,
with most adults achieving effect with total daily doses of <960 mg/
day, divided in four to eight doses. Pyridostigmine is given in short-­
acting forms and can also be used in a long-­acting form at bedtime
for patients with more weakness upon awakening in the morning.
Overdoses of cholinesterase inhibitors produce cholinergic crises
with symptoms such as increased secretions, diarrhea, and cramping;
atropine blocks the muscarinic effects but does not block the nicotinic
effects that produce additional skeletal muscle weakness. In the rare
familial MG caused by the absence of end plate AChE, cholinesterase
inhibitors are not helpful and often cause increased weakness; these
patients can be treated with ephedrine or diaminopyridine, both of
which increase ACh release from terminal axons.
Because of the autoimmune basis of the disease, long-­term steroid
treatment with prednisone may be effective. Thymectomy should be
considered and might provide a cure. Thymectomy is most effective in
patients who have high titers of anti-­AChR antibodies in the plasma
and who have been symptomatic for <2 years. Thymectomy is ineffective in congenital and familial forms of MG. Treatment of hypothyroidism usually abolishes an associated myasthenia without the use of
cholinesterase inhibitors or steroids.
If the specific genetic variant can be identified in a patient with one
of the CMSs, specific therapeutic approaches are available for some that
differ from the treatments listed earlier (see Tables 652.1 and 652.6).
Plasmapheresis is effective treatment in some children, particularly
those who do not respond to steroids, but plasma exchange therapy
provides only temporary remission. Intravenous immunoglobulin is
beneficial and should be tried before plasmapheresis because it is less
invasive. Plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin appear to
be most effective in patients with high circulating levels of anti-­AChR

3865

antibodies. Refractory patients, as well as patients with MuSK-­related
MG, might respond more effectively to rituximab, a monoclonal antibody to the B-­cell CD20 antigen. Efgartigimod (Vyvgart) is an antibody fragment Fc receptor antagonist, inhibiting the Fc receptor from
recycling IgG into the circulation, and is FDA approved for patients
≥18 years of age with severe, generalized AChR antibody–positive MG.
Clinical trials have started in children 2-­18 years of age.
Neonates with transient maternally transmitted MG require cholinesterase inhibitors for only a few days or occasionally for a few weeks,
especially to allow feeding. No other treatment is usually necessary. In
non–maternally transmitted congenital MG, identification of the specific molecular defect is important for treatment; Table 652.6 summarizes specific therapies for each type.

Complications

Children with MG do not tolerate neuromuscular-­blocking drugs, such
as succinylcholine and pancuronium, and may be paralyzed for weeks
after a single dose. An anesthesiologist should carefully review myasthenic patients who require a surgical anesthetic, and such anesthetics
should be administered only by an experienced physician/anesthesiologist. Also, certain antibiotics can potentiate myasthenia and should
be avoided; these include the aminoglycosides, β-­blocking agents, procainamide, chloroquine, and fluoroquinolones.

Prognosis

Some patients with autoimmune MG experience spontaneous remission after a period of months or years; others have a permanent disease extending into adult life. Immunosuppression, thymectomy, and
treatment of associated hypothyroidism might provide a cure. Genetically determined CMSs may show initial worsening in infancy but then
remain static throughout childhood and into adult life.

3866 Part XXVI u Neuromuscular Disorders
OTHER CAUSES OF NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKADE

Organophosphate chemicals, commonly used as insecticides, can
cause a myasthenia-­like syndrome in children exposed to these toxins
(see Chapter 94).
Botulism results from ingestion of food containing the toxin of Clostridium botulinum, a gram-­positive, spore-­bearing, anaerobic bacillus (see
Chapter 256). The incubation period is short, only a few hours, and symptoms begin with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Cranial nerve involvement soon follows, with diplopia, dysphagia, weak suck, facial weakness,
and absent gag reflex. The mechanism is cleavage by the botulinum toxin
of several of the structural glycoproteins of the wall (i.e., membrane) of
synaptic vesicles within axonal terminals. These glycoproteins include synaptobrevin and synaptotagmin, but synaptophysin is resistant.
In infantile botulism, which classically presents between the ages of
4 and 7 months, honey as well as spores from dirt (e.g., near construction sites) are common sources of contamination. The earliest signs are
usually constipation, poor feeding, and then a weak cry. On evaluation,
patients appear hypotonic, with facial weakness, dysphagia, and a poor
gag. Generalized weakness with a risk of respiratory failure can occur.
Generalized hypotonia and weakness then develop and can progress to
respiratory failure. Neuromuscular blockade is documented by EMG with
repetitive nerve stimulation. Slow repetitive nerve stimulation may show a
decremental response, and baseline CMAP amplitudes may be low. With
rapid repetitive nerve stimulation, there is an incremental response. EMG/
repetitive nerve stimulation studies may help in confirming a diagnosis if
the clinical presentation is not straightforward. However, when suspected,
botulinum toxin studies should be sent preferentially from stool samples
from the patient, and then treatment should be initiated as soon as possible with Botulinum Immune Globulin IV (Baby-­BIG or BIG-­IV). BIG-­IV,
which is human-­derived antibotulism toxin antibodies, is approved by the
FDA for the treatment of infant botulism types A and B. Early use of BIG­IV has shortened the overall length of hospitalization and improved the
time to recovery. Respiratory and feeding/gavage support may be required
for days or weeks until the toxin is cleared from the body.
Tick paralysis is a disorder of ACh release from axonal terminals
due to a neurotoxin that blocks depolarization. It also affects large,
myelinated motor and sensory nerve fibers. This toxin is produced by
the wood tick or dog tick, insects common in the Appalachian and
Rocky Mountains of North America. The tick embeds its head into the
skin, usually the scalp, and neurotoxin production is maximal about
5-­6 days later. Motor symptoms include weakness, loss of coordination, and sometimes an ascending paralysis resembling Guillain-­Barré
syndrome. Tendon reflexes are lost. Sensory symptoms of tingling paresthesias can occur in the face and extremities. The diagnosis is confirmed by identification of the tick, and treatment involves the prompt
removal of the entire tick. It is important to monitor patients closely,
because some patients may show worsened respiratory symptoms for
the first day after tick removal. Most patients will show rapid improvement within a few hours to a few days from the time of tick removal.

652.2 Spinal Muscular Atrophies
Adnan Y. Manzur
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a degenerative disease of motor
neurons that begins in fetal life and continues to be progressive in
infancy and childhood. Among the autosomal recessive disorders in
childhood, SMA is the most common cause of infant mortality, and
is second in birth prevalence only to cystic fibrosis. The incidence of
SMA is estimated to be 1 in 6,000-­10,000 newborns, with a carrier
frequency of approximately 1/40-­1/60. It is a clinically heterogeneous,
panethnic disorder. SMA is caused by a homozygous deletion in the
survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene on chromosome 5q13. Infrequent families with autosomal dominant inheritance are described,
and a rare X-­linked recessive form also occurs. There is also a separate
group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous non-­5q SMA forms
(see Chapter 652.3).

The pathologic hallmark of SMA is the progressive denervation of
muscle. This is compensated for in part by reinnervation from an adjacent motor unit, but giant motor units are thus created, with subsequent atrophy of muscle fibers when the reinnervating motor neuron
eventually becomes involved. Motor neurons of cranial nerves III, IV,
and VI to the extraocular muscles, as well as those of the sacral spinal
cord innervating striated muscle of the urethral and anal sphincters,
are selectively spared. The upper motor neurons (layer 5 pyramidal
neurons in the cerebral cortex) also remain normal.
SMA is classified clinically into a severe infantile form, also known
as Werdnig-­Hoffmann disease or SMA type I; a late infantile and more
slowly progressive form, SMA type II; a more chronic or juvenile form,
Kugelberg-­Welander disease, or SMA type III; and an adult-­onset
form (SMA type IV). A severe fetal form that is usually fatal in the
perinatal period has been described as SMA type 0, with motor neuron
degeneration demonstrated in the spinal cord as early as midgestation.
These distinctions of types are based upon the age at onset, severity
of weakness, maximum motor milestone achieved, and clinical course
(Table 652.7). Some patients are transitional between types I and II or
between types II and III in terms of clinical function. Of note, the SMN
gene region comprises a centromeric copy containing the SMN2 gene.
There is a correlation between the severity of disease, age at onset, and
SMN2 copy number, and a higher SMN2 copy number is associated
with milder disease severity.
Muscle biopsy does not distinguish types I and II, though type III
shows a more adult than perinatal pattern of denervation and reinnervation. Type 0 can show biopsy features more similar to those of myotubular myopathy because of maturational arrest; scattered myotubes
and other immature fetal fibers also are demonstrated in the muscle
biopsies of patients with types I and II, but they do not predominate.
Autonomic motor neurons of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems are not spared, but usually do not show clinical manifestations until late stages. Autonomic deficits may involve the detrusor
muscle of the urinary bladder or the smooth muscle urethral and anal
sphincters, in all three forms of SMA. In some patients with type I SMA
and respiratory distress, there may be severe autonomic dysregulation
with dysautonomia and cardiovascular collapse leading to death or to
severe ischemic brain damage. The differential diagnosis is noted in
Table 652.8.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND COURSE

The cardinal features of the classic, most common phenotype, SMA
type I, can be summarized as a presentation before the age of 6
months with severe hypotonia (Fig. 652.1); symmetric generalized
muscle weakness affecting the lower limbs more than the upper limbs,
proximal more than distal; frog-­leg posture; absence of deep tendon
reflexes; tongue fasciculations; and selective involvement of the axial
and intercostal muscles but sparing of diaphragm. SMA is in the differential diagnosis list of floppy infant syndrome (see Chapter 648).
Due to the involvement of the intercostal respiratory muscles, there is
a typical paradoxical abdominal breathing pattern, bell-­shaped chest,
and weak cough (Video 652.1). Infants lie flaccid with little movement,
unable to overcome gravity, and lack head control. These infants rarely
achieve improvements of motor function and acquire motor developmental milestones (see Fig. 648.1 in Chapter 648). In contrast to their
severe weakness and floppiness, infants with SMA type I have an alert
and bright expression with preserved cognitive functions. There is
no involvement of the facial and extraocular muscles at presentation,
although facial weakness does occur at later stages of the disease.
SMA type I is not homogeneous within itself. At least three clinical subgroups can be defined as (1) severe weakness from birth or the
neonatal period and head control is never achieved; (2) presentation
after the neonatal period, within the first 2 months, and head control is
never achieved; and (3) onset after the neonatal period but head control is achieved, and rarely, some of the infants may gain the ability to
sit with support. There may be a range of clinical presentations and
courses of respiratory involvement and swallowing and sucking difficulties in this fragile group of SMA type I patients.
Infants with SMA type I develop respiratory failure within the first
2 years of life, and without respiratory and nutritional support, they

usually do not survive beyond their second birthday. A multidisciplinary approach (respiratory, gastrointestinal, and orthopedic interventions) combined with noninvasive ventilatory support (NIV) and
enteral feeding have changed the natural course of the disease over
the years. To date, the median time to either death or full-­time NIV
(NIV >16 hr/day) is 13.5 months with improved supportive respiratory and nutritional care. Infants who are symptomatic prenatally or
at birth are classified as having a rare phenotype, SMA type 0 (<1%);
they can present with severe muscle weakness, respiratory distress,
feeding problems, and cranial nerve involvement. Congenital contractures, ranging from simple clubfoot to generalized arthrogryposis,
occur in approximately 10% of severely involved neonates (see Chapter
648.10). There is a perception of decreased intrauterine movements by
the mother; these infants usually die within the first months of life.
Although motor neurons are primarily affected tissue in SMA, other
tissues, including those of the brain, cardiac system, vascular system,
and even sensory nerves, may also contribute to the overall phenotype,
especially in the most severe forms of the disease. Early-­stage developmental congenital heart defects described in severe SMA patients,
generally carrying one copy of SMN2, include atrial septal defects, a
dilated right ventricle, ventricular septal defects, and hypoplastic left
heart syndrome. These patients are also prone to possible involvement
of the autonomic nervous system, which may result in arrhythmia and
sudden death. Vasculopathy can be another rare presentation, and
ulceration and necrosis of the fingers and toes have also been described
in two severe type I SMA patients.
In type II SMA, affected infants are usually able to suck and swallow,
and respiration is adequate in early infancy. Developmental delay in

gross motor milestones or stagnation of motor development between
the ages of 6 and 18 months is rather typical for this form. Proximal
muscle weakness is again more prominent in the lower extremities
compared with the upper extremities. Patients can sit without support
but are unable to walk independently. These children show progressive
weakness, but many survive into the school years or beyond, although
they are confined to an electric wheelchair and severely handicapped.
Nasal speech and problems with deglutition develop later. Respiratory
complications are less severe and develop later during the course of the
disease. Scoliosis becomes a major complication in many patients with
long survival times. Gastroesophageal reflux may lead to malnutrition
or to aspiration with acute airway obstruction or pneumonia.
Kugelberg-­Welander disease is the mildest SMA (type III), and
patients can appear normal in infancy. The progressive weakness is proximal in distribution, particularly involving the shoulder girdle muscles.
Patients are ambulatory and develop a variable course of proximal muscle weakness after the age of 18 months. A significant proportion of children with SMAIII, especially the ones with onset of symptoms before 3
years of age, suffer loss of ambulation at some point during the course of
the disease. Symptoms of bulbar muscle weakness are rare. Patients with
SMA III may have muscular hypertrophy rather than atrophy, and it may
easily be confused with a muscular dystrophy (Video 652.2). Longevity
extends well into adult life. Fasciculations are a specific clinical sign of
the denervation of muscle. In thin children, they may be seen in the deltoid and biceps brachii muscles and occasionally the quadriceps femoris
muscles, but the continuous, involuntary, wormlike movements may
be masked by a thick pad of subcutaneous fat. Fasciculations are best
observed in the tongue, where almost no subcutaneous connective tissue

separates the muscular layer from the epithelium. If the intrinsic lingual muscles are contracted, as in crying or when the tongue protrudes,
fasciculations are more difficult to see than when the tongue is relaxed.
Cramps and myalgias of appendicular and axial muscles are common,
especially in later stages, and problems of micturition may be present,
though adolescent patients may be too embarrassed to state them unless
the physician directly inquires.

The outstretched fingers of children with SMA often show a characteristic tremor (polyminimyoclonus) due to fasciculations and weakness
(Video 652.3). It should not be confused with a cerebellar tremor.
The adult phenotype of the disease is SMA type IV, which is characterized by a mild muscle weakness with an onset usually in the second
or third decade of life. There may be an intrafamilial variability in the
clinical expression of the disease.
The intelligence is normal, and children often appear brighter than
their normal peers because the effort they cannot put into physical activities is redirected to intellectual development, and they are often exposed
to adult speech more than to juvenile language because of the social
repercussions of the disease. Progressive deterioration of ambulation and
the high risk of falling and fracturing long bones or the pelvis eventually require use of a wheelchair; an electric wheelchair often is needed
because weakness of the upper extremities does not allow the patient to
manually push the wheels. Progressive scoliosis is another serious complication and may have a further adverse effect on respiration.

LABORATORY FINDINGS

The CK level may be normal, but more commonly is mildly elevated
(up to twofold to fourfold), but usually not more than 10 times
the normal upper limit. The chest x-­ray in early-­onset disease may
demonstrate thin ribs. ECG may serve as a simple and practical
tool in patients with SMA to demonstrate a baseline tremor as an
artifact representing muscle fibrillations more prominent on lead II
(Fig. 652.2). Although seen in mainly lower motor neuron diseases
(MNDs), including poliomyelitis, recognition of this ECG pattern
may prevent further electrophysiologic tests (EMG and nerve conduction studies [NCSs]) in SMA patients. Electrophysiologic studies (EMG-­NCS) should be reserved for selected atypical patients.
The results of motor NCSs are normal, except for mild slowing in
terminal stages of the disease, an important feature distinguishing
SMA from peripheral neuropathy. EMG shows fibrillation potentials
and other signs of the denervation of muscle. There is no need for a
muscle biopsy, which demonstrates a neurogenic pattern with group
atrophy in all forms of SMA.

DIAGNOSIS

The simplest, most definitive first-­step diagnostic test in a patient with
a clinical suspicion of SMA and normal and/or mildly elevated serum
CK levels is a molecular genetic marker in the blood for the homozygous deletion in SMN1 (Table 652.9). The current gold standard is
SMN1 deletion/variant and SMN2 copy number testing, with a minimal standard of SMN1 deletion testing. The homozygous absence of
SMN1 exon 7 (with or without deletion of exon 8) confirms the diagnosis of SMA. The genetic test for SMA has a 95% sensitivity and nearly
100% specificity (see Table 652.9). Real-­time polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) or multiplex ligation-­dependent probe amplification (MLPA)
tests give rapid and reliable SMN1 gene copy numbers. Semiquantitative assays improve the diagnostic sensitivity up to 98%. According to
different scenarios, if the patient has a single SMN1 copy, the coding

region of the second undeleted allele should be sequenced to identify
the second causative variant, including point variations, insertions,
and deletions. Direct sequencing of the gene is also recommended in
patients with a clinical diagnosis, two SMN1 copies, and a consanguineous background.
Muscle biopsy is used more selectively in patients showing equivocal or negative genetic findings. The muscle biopsy in infancy reveals
a characteristic pattern of perinatal denervation that is unlike that of
mature muscle. Groups of giant type I fibers are mixed with fascicles
of severely atrophic fibers of both histochemical types (Fig. 652.3).
Scattered immature myofibers resembling myotubes also are demonstrated. In juvenile SMA, the pattern may be more similar to adult muscle that has undergone many cycles of denervation and reinnervation.
Neurogenic changes in muscle also may be demonstrated by EMG, but
the results are less definitive than by muscle biopsy in infancy. Sural
nerve biopsy is performed only occasionally, but shows mild sensory
neuropathic changes, and the sensory nerve conduction velocity may
be slowed; hypertrophy of unmyelinated axons also is seen. At autopsy,
mild degenerative changes are seen in sensory neurons of dorsal root
ganglia and in somatosensory nuclei of the thalamus, but these alterations are not perceived clinically as a sensory loss or paresthesias. The
most pronounced neuropathologic lesions are the extensive neuronal
degeneration and gliosis in the ventral horns of the spinal cord and
brainstem motor nuclei, especially the hypoglossal nucleus. On rare
instances, the clinical features of an SMA-­like presentation may be a
feature of mitochondrial diseases (SCO2, DGUOK, and TK2 gene variants). SCO2 encodes one of the COX assembly proteins, and the latter
two gene variants are associated with mitochondrial DNA depletion
syndromes. Unexpectedly elevated serum CK levels at some point in
the clinical course of these patients, and cognitive developmental delay,
can be clues to considering a mitochondrial disease in the differential

diagnosis. Depending on the stage and progression of the disease, a
muscle biopsy demonstrating ragged red fibers and COX-­deficient
fibers, may help in the differential diagnosis.

GENETICS

The genetic locus for all three of the common forms of SMA is on chromosome 5, a deletion at the 5q11-­q13 locus, confirming that they are
variants of the same disease rather than different diseases. The affected
SMN1 gene has a molecular weight of 38 kDa and contains 8 exons that
span 20 kb and telomeric and centromeric exons that differ only by 5
bp and produce a transcript encoding 294 amino acids. SMN1 is duplicated in a highly homologous gene called SMN2, and both genes are
transcribed. SMN2 remains present in all patients with SMA but cannot fully compensate for the SMN1 defect. However, a molecular basis
for correlation between the SMN2 copy number and clinical severity
of the SMA is the capability of SMN2 to encode a small amount of
an identical SMN protein. The critical difference between SMN1 and
SMN2 is a cytosine (C) to thymine (T) transition in exon 7 of SMN2
(Fig. 652.4).
The SMN complex has a role in the formation of small nuclear
ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), through assembly of Sm-­
proteins
(a distinctive family of RNA-­associated small proteins) onto small
nuclear RNAs (SnRNAs). SMN deficiency and reduced snRNP
assembly capacity are hypothesized to cause aberrant splicing or
transport of RNPs to motor neurons. Dysregulation of genes involved

Fig. 652.4 Genetics of spinal muscular atrophy. In humans, the SMN protein is encoded by the SMN1 and SMN2 genes. The C to T substitution

in exon 7 of SMN2 is translationally silent but alters splicing such that the majority of SMN2 transcripts lack exon 7 and the truncated protein is
unstable. Normally, SMN1 produces abundant SMN protein. In SMA, homozygous variants of SMN1 result in only a small amount of functional SMN
protein contributed by the varying copy numbers of SMN2. mRNA, messenger RNA; SMN, survival motor neuron. (From Farrar MA, Park SB, Vucic
S, et al. Emerging therapies and challenges in spinal muscular atrophy. Ann Neurol. 2017;81:355–368.)

in synaptogenesis and the maintenance of neuromuscular junctions
in animal studies possibly explains the special vulnerability of motor
neurons. A second view is that, independent from snRNPs assembly, SMN may have a motor neuron–specific role such as mRNA
transport along the axon. Considering the length of axons, integrity
of neuromuscular junctions, and interactions with skeletal muscle,
SMN protein deficiency may be detrimental for motor neurons. SMN
is localized in bright-­dot–like structures, called gems (gemini of Cajal
bodies) in the nucleus. It is also present in other cellular structures
such as Golgi bodies, cell membranes, and especially the axon and
growth cone compartments of motor neurons. Due to its localization
in ribonucleoprotein granules in neurites and growth cones in neurons, SMN modulates axonal growth and localization of β-­actin messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in growth cones of motor neurons.
Early functional impairment of sensory-­motor connectivity in animal models showed that motor neuron loss follows afferent synapse
loss with the same temporal and topographic pattern, with changes
occurring first in motor neurons innervating the proximal muscles
and axial muscles, and then the distal muscles. The third view connects SMN function, in a direct or indirect manner, to actin dynamics
and actin-­dependent processes. There is an expansion in the spectrum of SMN function, including actin dynamics, vesicular transport, protein translation and trafficking, mRNA transport, apoptosis,
and many others, which are reflected to widespread pathophysiologic
findings described in humans and animal models (Fig. 652.5).
The severity of the disease is inversely correlated with the amount
of functional SMN protein. In that sense, other than the SMN2 copy
number, which is the major protective modifier, the severity of the
phenotype can be also influenced by other genetic modifiers, including
plastin 3 and neurocalcin. Nutritional deficiency, oxidative stress, and
hypoxia may contribute to widespread splicing alterations, including
SMN2, and affect the disease progression.
Carrier testing by dose analysis is available and is based on semiquantitative real-­time PCR or MLPA. In this context, limitations of the
molecular testing, difficulties in predicting the offspring’s phenotype
based solely on the SMN2 copy number, and the effect on reproductive
planning should be considered.

Newborn screening is aimed at identifying presymptomatic SMA
patients. DNA extraction from newborn blood spots, followed by
either liquid microbead array or real-­time PCR techniques, helps to
identify SMN1 homozygous deletions. Challenges in newborn screening include the inability to detect carriers of heterozygous deletions of
SMN1, and SMN2 copy numbers.

MANAGEMENT

A multidisciplinary and supportive approach is the key in the management of a patient with SMA along with published updated standards of care. Follow-­up coordination should be managed by an expert
in neuromuscular disorders, and the team ideally should include a
pediatric and an adult neurologist, respiratory physicians, geneticists,
gastroenterologists, palliative care physicians, rehabilitation specialists, orthopedic surgeons, and allied healthcare professionals. The
consensus statement for the standard of care in SMA includes ethical
and palliative care sections. Despite increased standards and technologic advances, there is a high variability in terms of ventilatory support, nutritional support, and scoliosis surgery. In terms of advances
in disease-­modifying treatments that will change the natural course
of the disease, care and treatment options should be discussed clearly
with the family and/or patients to define expectations, the quality of
life, and palliative care issues. Because SMA is a dynamic disease by
nature, a proactive plan should be introduced in almost every care subtopic (Table 652.10). Overall, supportive therapy should aim to help the
patient to be as functionally independent as possible.

THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES

The prognosis, especially for SMA type I, has been improved due to
the use of genetically based treatments with three drugs, nusinersen,
onasemnogene, and risdiplam (Table 652.11). These drugs are expensive and may not be available in all countries.
SMN-­antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), nusinersen, administered
intrathecally is approved by the FDA and by the European Medicines
Agency for all types of SMA patients. It modifies the splicing of SMN2
by inducing an increase in exon 7 retention in SMN2 pre-­mRNA,
which finally allows a protein product similar to SMN1. The initial

Fig. 652.5 Pathophysiologic findings in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Multiple functional abnormalities in motor networks have been identified

in SMA mice and humans, including defects in astrocytes, Schwann cells, motor neurons, and skeletal muscle. Disease-­associated phenotypes have
also been reported across a range of other organs in SMA mice (in some cases supported by data from human patients), including cardiac structural
and functional abnormalities, gastrointestinal tract dysfunction, and irregular bone remodeling. One potential unifying factor may be a deficiency in
the development of the vasculature in SMA, with the resulting hypoxia likely impacting a range of cell types. (From Farrar MA, Park SB, Vucic S, et al.

support in patients with SMA type I varies considerably and practice varies internationally.
†There is no consensus on management of scoliosis or hip subluxation/dislocation in nonambulant patients. If there is no fast progression of scoliosis, surgery should be delayed

“loading” regime is with four intrathecal doses of nusinersen over
the first 2 months, and this is followed by an intrathecal dose every 4
months, anticipated to be continued for life for maintenance of benefit.
Nusinersen in phase 1 to phase 3 studies in SMA type I (0-­6 months)
showed favorable safety and tolerability with statistically significant
improvement in survival and motor milestones. Two-­year follow-­up
data on “real-­world use” of an Italian clinical cohort reported that sitting was achieved in all the seven patients treated before 210 days of age
(100%), in 11 of 23 treated between 210 days and 2 years (55%), and
in 3 of 14 treated between 2 and 4 years of age (17.6%). Only one child
achieved independent walking. The NURTURE study group has also
reported a cohort of 25 presymptomatic infants (15 with two copies of
SMN2, and 10 with three copies of SMN2) with a median follow-­up of
approximately 3 years: all participants achieved the ability to sit without support, 23/25 (92%) achieved walking with assistance, and 22/25
(88%) achieved walking independently. Long-­term follow-­up is necessary to evaluate the effect of this treatment at different stages of the
disease. Scoliosis, surgical interventions, and severe respiratory disease
may complicate the lumbar puncture procedure.
The clinical trial data of the use of nusinersen in SMA type II/III
patients (2-­14 years) has also been very positive, with statistically significant improvement in functional assessment scores and motor milestones. Real-­world cohort data from multiple studies of intrathecal

nusinersen has reported improvement in walking ability or 6-­minute
walk distance in SMA3.
Risdiplam is an orally administered small molecule drug that modifies SMN2 pre-­mRNA splicing and has been approved by the FDA for
the treatment of patients with SMA who are 2 months of age or older.
Risdiplam promotes the inclusion of exon 7, thereby increasing the
expression of full-­length SMN2 mRNA and functional SMN protein.
A phase 2-­3 open-­label study of risdiplam SMA1 infants age 1-­7
months reported that sitting was achieved in 30% of the treated infants.
Another study was in open-­label extension, with optimized dose of risdiplam; 41 infants were enrolled and after 12 months of treatment, 12
infants (29%) were able to sit without support for at least 5 seconds, a
milestone not attained in the natural history of SMA1.
Onasemnogene abeparvovec is a single-­dose intravenously administered SMN gene replacement therapy (GRT) to replace SMN1 and
thus increase the production of the full-­length SMN protein. It has FDA
license for use up to 2 years of age and European medicines Agency
approval children up to 21 kg bodyweight, so it primarily addresses the
SMA1 population. The adeno-­associated viral vector (AAV9) is used to
transport a functional copy of SMN1, crossing the blood-­brain barrier.
The phase I clinical trial of intravenously administered GRT in SMA
type I patients established a safety profile, but alanine transaminase

first month after treatment, indicating an immune-­mediated “hepatitis,” which requires treatment with prednisolone starting the day before
treatment, and weaned off over a period of 3-­4 months. Thrombotic
angiopathy is a rare but life-­threatening adverse effect.
The efficacy of onasemnogene has completely altered the natural history of SMA1. In an open-­label study, 12 infants received the high (therapeutic) dose of onasemnogene at mean age of 3.4 months and follow-­up
was reported at median age 25 months; 11 patients sat unassisted, 11
were fed orally and could speak, and 2 walked independently. Five-­year
follow-­up data were available for 10 of the 12 patients in the therapeutic-­
dose cohort (families of 2 infants refused participation in the follow-­up
study). All these patients remained alive and without the need for permanent ventilation (permanent ventilation is defined as need for ventilatory support for more than 16 hours per day) and maintained previously
acquired motor milestones. Two patients attained the new milestone of
“standing with assistance” without the use of nusinersen.
The outcome of single-­dose onasemnogene gene therapy for symptomatic infantile-­onset SMA1 has demonstrated that 14 of 32 patients
achieved independent sitting at 18 months of age. Only 1 patient
achieved walking. This study had broader inclusion and exclusion
criteria compared with others, which resulted in inclusion of patients
with more severe disease at baseline, at least in part explaining why the
results were not as positive. There are no randomized controlled trials
or systematic reviews comparing nusinersen, risdiplam, and onasemnogene, and their use is dictated by patient age, SMA categorization
and severity, availability and funding, and patient choice.
Genetic counseling, depending on carrier screening tests, or in
the presence of a previously affected child with SMA, may help with
reproductive planning (prenatal diagnosis or preimplantation diagnosis). Prenatal diagnosis should be offered to families with an index
patient in the family (recurrence risk is 25%), and antenatal screening
by chorionic villus sampling between the 10th and 12th gestational
week of pregnancy may serve for SMN1 deletion/variant analysis.

652.3 Other Motor Neuron Diseases
Adnan Y. Manzur
Motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are a heterogeneous group of progressive neurodegenerative disorders characterized by upper and lower neuron dysfunction, with an onset from birth to adulthood. A variety of
causes, including hereditary, immune-­mediated, infectious, paraneoplastic, and sporadic diseases, should be considered.
Acute flaccid paralysis is the most common presentation of MND
in children; it may occur in outbreaks. Poliomyelitis used to be a major
cause of chronic disability, but with the routine use of polio vaccine,
this viral infection is rare (see Chapter 296). Other enteroviruses, such
as coxsackievirus and echovirus, or the live polio vaccine virus can also
cause an acute infection of motor neurons, with symptoms and signs
similar to poliomyelitis, although usually milder. Specific PCR tests
and viral cultures of cerebrospinal fluid are diagnostic. A clustering of
cases of acute flaccid paralysis has been reported during outbreaks of
enterovirus D68 in multiple states in children (mean age 7-­11 years).
Limb weakness is often asymmetric and includes bulbar weakness, as
well as cranial nerve VI and VII involvement. MRI may demonstrate
longitudinal spinal cord lesions with dominant anterior horn cell
involvement (Fig. 652.6). Cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis and elevated
protein are common. Treatments have included steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin; persistent paresis is a common sequela. Motor
neuron infection with the West Nile virus also occurs.
In children, an insidious onset, slow progression, and family history
can be clues for a genetic basis. Although the most common MND in
children is 5q13-­associated SMA, with a typical or predominant lower
motor neuron phenotype, there is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of MNDs that overlap with hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs), hereditary sensory-­motor neuropathies (HSMNs), and
juvenile forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

A less common group of MNDs, not associated with SMN1, are
called non–5q13-­associated SMAs; this heterogeneous group can be
associated with X-­linked, autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive SMAs, distal SMAs, segmental SMAs, or distal hereditary
motor neuropathies or neuronopathies. Additional features, such
as deafness; epilepsy; encephalopathy; spasticity; visual impairment;
or brainstem, cerebellar, gastrointestinal, or rheumatologic disorders
may be indicative of a widespread involvement. These atypical SMA
phenotypes can also be called SMA-­plus syndromes, and they show
extensive phenotypic overlap and molecular genetic heterogeneity (see
Table 652.7). Primary involvement of the upper motor neuron, with a
progressive upper and lower motor neuron loss, characterize juvenile
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which is rare and ultimately fatal.
There has been an increase in the molecular diagnostic yield and
expansion of these clinical phenotypes. This further helps not only to
understand the natural course and common pathophysiologic mechanisms involved, but also indicates the appropriate genetic counseling
and prenatal diagnosis.
A pattern of weakness, amyotrophy, and progression (proximal or distal, bulbar or respiratory involvement), the presence of spasticity, deep
tendon reflexes, and the family history should be evaluated. In contrast
to typical SMA, electrophysiologic studies and EMG may serve as important tools to demonstrate a neurogenic basis. Multisystem assessment,
including vision, hearing, and cognitive development, is required. Clinical evaluation and recognition of distinctive features will help to classify
MND and consider treatable MND forms in the differential diagnosis.
SMA with respiratory distress (SMARD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease due to pathogenic variants in the gene encoding IGHMBP2
on chromosome 11q13. In contrast to classical SMA type I, predominant distal weakness with diaphragmatic palsy results in severe respiratory failure. There is usually an early presentation between 6 weeks
and 6 months of age, with intrauterine growth restriction, a weak cry
and suck, and congenital foot deformities. Routine chest x-­ray may
reveal diaphragmatic eventration, which causes early respiratory failure. Atypical patients with peripheral neuropathy and no respiratory
involvement have also been described. Beyond the core symptoms,
sensory and autonomic dysfunction (excessive sweating, urinary retention, constipation, and cardiac arrhythmia), seizures, and progressive
cranial nerve involvement can be additional features.
Brown-­Vialetto-­Van Laere (BVVL) syndrome is a rare heterogeneous
neurodegenerative disorder characterized by involvement of cranial
nerves VII-­XII, progressive facial weakness, sensorineural deafness, dysphagia, tongue amyotrophy, fasciculations, bulbar palsy, and respiratory
insufficiency. It may present at all ages. Weakness of the arms and hands,
optic atrophy, and ataxia may be additional presentations. The clinical
presentation of Fazio-­Londe syndrome is the same and characterized by
progressive bulbar palsy resulting from motor neuron degeneration more
in the brainstem than the spinal cord, without sensorineural deafness.
Identification of pathogenic variants in the riboflavin transporter
genes provided a targeted therapeutic strategy with oral or intravenous
high-­dose riboflavin supplementation with the starting dose being 10 mg/
kg/day. The oral riboflavin dose may need to be sequentially increased to
50 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients and 1500 mg/day in adult patients for
maximum benefit. The clinical response in this group may be variable,
ranging from a rapid response to gradual improvement over 12 months,
clinical stabilization, or rarely no response. Recognition of abnormal
acylcarnitine profiles mimicking multiple acyl-­CoA dehydrogenase deficiency in BVVL should also be considered. A biochemical response to
treatment is also evident. The common core phenotype of this treatable
MND includes progressive axonal sensorimotor neuropathy (manifesting with sensory ataxia and severe weakness of the upper limbs and axial
muscles with distinctly preserved muscle power of the lower limbs),
hearing loss, optic atrophy, and respiratory insufficiency.
The classic form of pontocerebellar hypoplasia with SMA (PCH1)
is characterized by severe hypotonia, areflexia, muscle weakness,
central visual impairment, dysphagia, respiratory insufficiency, and
acquired microcephaly, with a presentation in the first months of life
and death in infancy. There is a wide clinical spectrum, with a severe
antenatal onset representing the severe end of the spectrum with
arthrogryposis and polyhydramnios.

SMA with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (SMAPME) is characterized by treatment-­resistant progressive myoclonic epilepsy combined
with proximal muscle weakness, areflexia, atrophy, progressive weakness, and dysphagia, followed by normal developmental milestones.
Mild facial weakness, tongue fasciculations, sensorineural hearing loss,
and tremor may be additional features. Rare variants include polyarticular arthritis with SMA, mild SMA without seizures, eyelid myoclonic status
epilepticus, and absence and atonic seizures in adolescence.
Lethal arthrogryposis with anterior horn cell disease (LAAHD) and
SMA with congenital arthrogryposis and fractures are atypical SMA forms
within the fetal akinesia/hypokinesia spectrum (see Chapter 648.10).
A variety of mitochondrial diseases may present with an SMA-­like
clinical phenotype. In addition to hypotonia, weakness, and respiratory
failure, there is a more extensive spectrum of multisystem involvement,
such as infantile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hepatic failure, spasticity, Leigh-­like syndrome, encephalopathy, seizures, brainstem dysfunction, global developmental delay, ptosis, and ophthalmoplegia. Lactic
acidosis and increased serum CK levels may further help to include
genes involved in COX assembly proteins and mitochondrial depletion
syndromes in the molecular genetic workup.
SMA with lower extremity predominance (SMALED) is characterized by congenital or early-­onset, proximal lower limb–predominant
muscle weakness and atrophy. There is again a wide range of clinical presentations from the antenatal to adulthood periods. Spasticity

and cognitive impairment can be a part of the clinical picture in some
patients. The most common gene responsible for this phenotype
is DYNC1H1, and its phenotypic spectrum spans lower extremity–predominant SMA, axonal Charcot-­Marie-­Tooth disease type 2,
neurodevelopmental disorders, malformations of cortical development, learning disability, epilepsy, HSP, and phenotypes may overlap.
DYNC1H1-­related SMALED has a distinctive pattern of lower limb
muscle MRI abnormalities, which are of diagnostic help.
Scapuloperoneal SMA is an autosomal dominant condition defined
by its selective muscle involvement, progressive distal weakness, and
atrophy. Laryngeal palsy, sensorineural deafness, short stature, scoliosis, and mild limb and skeletal dysplasia may accompany the picture.
Motor neurons become involved in several metabolic diseases of
the nervous system, such as gangliosidosis (Tay-­Sachs disease), ceroid
lipofuscinosis (Batten disease), and glycogenosis II (Pompe disease),
but the signs of denervation may be minor or obscured by the more
prominent involvement of other parts of the central nervous system
or of muscle. Amyotrophy related to lower motor neuron degeneration is a prominent future of some multisystem disorders, such as
infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD), achalasia-­
addisonianism-­
alacrima (AAA, triple A, or Allgrove syndrome), and Chédiak-­Higashi
s­ yndrome (CHS).

3876 Part XXVI u Neuromuscular Disorders

The hereditary motor-­sensory neuropathies (HMSNs) are a group of
progressive diseases of peripheral nerves of genetic (and syndrome)
etiology (Tables 653.1 and 653.2). HMSNs are the most common
group of hereditary neuropathies and the term Charcot-­Marie-­Tooth
disease (CMT) is used interchangeably, and more commonly. Motor
components generally dominate the clinical picture, but sensory and
autonomic involvement is expressed later. Sural nerve biopsy used
to be the most definitive means of diagnosis, but with the expanded
knowledge of the molecular genetics of this group of diseases, the
diagnosis of most can be confirmed by less invasive genetic testing.
Electromyography (EMG) remains a useful adjunct to clinical diagnosis and helps distinguish between demyelinating or hypomyelinating and axonal forms. Clinical clues are noted in Tables 653.3-­653.5.
Classification of HMSNs is difficult because no simple unifying
scheme is capable of incorporating all the clinical presentations and
overlapping genetics (see Tables 653.1 and 653.2). More than 140 genes
have been described as causing the HMSN/CMT spectrum. In some
neuropathies, a diverse genotype with pathogenic variants in different
genes at different chromosomal loci may produce a similar phenotype.
One classification identifies the following:
I.	Hereditary neuropathies secondary to general diseases
II.	Primary neuropathies
IIa.	Hereditary motor sensory neuropathies
IIb.	Distal hereditary motor neuropathies
IIc.	Hereditary sensory ± autonomic neuropathies
III.	Syndromic neuropathies, including congenital hypomyelinating
neuropathies
IV.	Hereditary sensory neuropathy (Refsum disease)

as the second year of life. The peroneal and tibial nerves are the earliest and most severely affected. Children with the disorder are often
described as being clumsy, falling easily, or tripping over their own feet.
Application of the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool for Youth is a
means of objectively documenting and following this manifestation.
The onset of symptoms may be delayed until after the fifth decade.
Muscles of the anterior compartment of the lower legs become
wasted, and the legs have a characteristic storklike contour. The muscular atrophy is accompanied by progressive weakness of dorsiflexion
of the ankle and eventual foot drop. The process is bilateral but may
be slightly asymmetric. Pes cavus deformities invariably develop as a
result of denervation of intrinsic foot muscles, further destabilizing the
gait. A small minority of individuals with CMT1A have hip dysplasia.
Atrophy of muscles of the forearms and hands is usually not as severe
as that of the lower extremities, but in advanced cases contractures of
the wrists and fingers produce a claw hand. Proximal muscle weakness is a late manifestation and is usually mild. Axial muscles are not
involved.
The disease is slowly progressive throughout life, but patients occasionally show accelerated deterioration of function over a few years.
Most patients remain ambulatory and have normal longevity, although
orthotic appliances are required to stabilize the ankles.
Sensory involvement mainly affects large, myelinated nerve fibers
that convey proprioceptive information and vibratory sense, but the
threshold for pain and temperature can also increase. Some children
complain of tingling or burning sensations of the feet, but pain is rare.
Because the muscle mass is reduced, the nerves are more vulnerable to
trauma or compression. Autonomic manifestations may be expressed
as poor vasomotor control with blotching or pallor of the skin of the
feet and inappropriately cold feet.
Nerves often become palpably enlarged. Tendon stretch reflexes are
lost distally. Cranial nerves are not affected. Sphincter control remains
well preserved. Autonomic neuropathy does not affect the heart, gastrointestinal tract, or bladder. Intelligence is normal. A unique point
variant in PMP22 causes progressive auditory nerve deafness in addition, but this is usually later in onset than the peripheral neuropathy.
X-­linked CMT disease (GJB1 variant) has been associated with an
acute disseminated encephalitis-­like illness.
Davidenkow syndrome is a variant of HMSN type I with a scapuloperoneal distribution.

LABORATORY FINDINGS AND DIAGNOSIS

Chapter 653

Hereditary Motor-­Sensory
Neuropathies
Adnan Y. Manzur*

653.1 Peroneal Muscular Atrophy
(Charcot-­Marie-­Tooth Disease,
HMSN Type IIa)
Adnan Y. Manzur
CMT is the most common genetically determined neuropathy and the
most common demyelinating variant, also described as CMT1A, and has
an overall prevalence of 3.8/100,000 population and accounts for >50% of
cases of HMSN overall. It is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait
with 83% expressivity; the 17p11.2 locus is the site of the abnormal gene.
Autosomal recessive transmission also is described but is rarer. The gene
product is peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22). A much rarer X-­linked
HMSN type I results from a defect at the Xq13.l locus, causing pathogenic
variants in the gap junction protein connexin-­32. Other forms, caused by
>40 genes, have been reported (see Table 653.1). Both fatty acid binding
by PMP22 and the kinetics of its membrane interactions are affected by
mutations.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Most patients are asymptomatic until late childhood or early adolescence, but young children sometimes manifest gait disturbance as early
* The editors are grateful to Dr. Harvey B. Sarnat and Dr. Diana X. Bharucha-­Goebel, much
of whose work on previous editions of this chapter is retained here.

Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities are greatly reduced,
sometimes as slow as 20% of the normal conduction time. In new cases
without a family history, both parents should be examined, and nerve
conduction studies should be performed.
EMG and muscle biopsy are not usually required for diagnosis, but
they show evidence of many cycles of denervation and reinnervation.
The serum creatine kinase level is normal. The cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) protein may be elevated, but no cells appear in the CSF.
Sural nerve biopsy is diagnostic. Large-­and medium-­size myelinated fibers are reduced in number, collagen is increased, and characteristic onion bulb formations of proliferated Schwann cell cytoplasm
surround axons. This pathologic finding is called interstitial hypertrophic neuropathy. Extensive segmental demyelination and remyelination also occur. The definitive molecular genetic diagnosis may
be made in blood.

TREATMENT

Stabilization of the ankles is a primary concern. In early stages, stiff
boots that extend to the midcalf often suffice, particularly when
patients walk on uneven surfaces such as ice and snow or stones. As
the dorsiflexors of the ankles weaken further, lightweight plastic splints
may be custom-­made to extend beneath the foot and around the back
of the ankle. They are worn inside the socks and are not visible, reducing self-­consciousness. External short-­leg braces may be required when
foot drop becomes complete. Soft tissue/bony foot surgery, or surgical fusion of the ankle may be considered in cases of progressive foot
deformity, depending upon age and severity.

3886 Part XXVI u Neuromuscular Disorders
The leg should be protected from traumatic injury. In advanced
cases, compression neuropathy during sleep may be prevented by placing soft pillows beneath or between the lower legs. Burning paresthesias of the feet are not common but are often abolished by phenytoin,
carbamazepine, or gabapentin. Progressive resistance exercise for foot
dorsiflexion may attenuate the progression of weakness.
Hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy 1 (HSAN1) has, in
preliminary studies, been treated with oral L-­serine, with biochemical
improvements (lowering of toxic metabolites). Multiple gene replacement therapies for CMT disease are in the experimental stage.

653.2 Peroneal Muscular Atrophy (Axonal
Type)
Adnan Y. Manzur
Peroneal muscular atrophy is clinically similar to HMSN type I, but the
rate of progression in the disability is variable. EMG shows denervation of muscle. Sural nerve biopsy reveals axonal degeneration rather
than the demyelination and whorls of Schwann cell processes typical in
the demyelinating type I. The most common form of axonal HMSN is
caused by pathogenic variants in the MFN2 gene with locus on chromosome 1 at 1p36. More than 40 genes have been described as causing
axonal HMSN, and the inheritance can be dominant or recessive.
An autosomal recessive infantile motor axonal neuropathy can
closely mimic infantile spinal muscular atrophy.

653.3 Congenital Hypomyelinating
Neuropathy and Déjèrine-­Sottas
Disease (HMSN Type III)
Adnan Y. Manzur
Congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy is an interstitial hypertrophic neuropathy of autosomal dominant transmission, clinically
similar to HMSN type I but more severe. Symptoms develop in early
infancy and are rapidly progressive, with hypotonia and breathing
and feeding difficulties. Pupillary abnormalities, such as lack of reaction to light and Argyll Robertson pupil, are common. Kyphoscoliosis
and pes cavus deformities complicate approximately 35% of cases.
Nerves become palpably enlarged at an early age. Déjèrine-­Sottas
disease is a more slowly progressive variant with onset usually before
age 5 years.
An autosomal recessive form of congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy also is known and may be caused by various pathologic genetic
variants, including MTMR2, PMP22, EGR2, and MPZ. A secondary
variant in the EGR2 gene may intensify the clinical manifestation of
Déjèrine disease. Neonatal hypotonia and developmental delay in
infancy are hallmark clinical features. Many patients exhibit congenital
insensitivity to pain. Cranial nerves are inconsistently involved, and
respiratory distress and dysphagia are rare complications. Tendon
reflexes are absent. Arthrogryposis is present at birth in at least half
of the cases.
The onion bulb formations seen in the sural nerve biopsy specimen
are pronounced. Hypomyelination also occurs. In the recessive form,
hypomyelination may not be accompanied by interstitial hypertrophy
in all cases.
The genetic locus of 17p11.2 is identical to that of HMSN type I
or CMT disease. Monoallelic variants in MPZ (myelin protein zero),
PMP22, or EGR2 (early grow response 2) are the most frequent genetic
causes. The clinical and pathologic differences may be phenotypic
variants of the same disease, analogous to the situation in Duchenne

and Becker muscular dystrophies. An autosomal recessive form of
Déjèrine-­Sottas disease is incompletely documented.

653.4 Roussy-­Lévy Syndrome
Adnan Y. Manzur
Roussy-­Lévy syndrome is defined as a combination of HMSN type II
and cerebellar deficit resembling Friedreich ataxia, but it does not have
cardiomyopathy.

653.5 Refsum Disease (HMSN Type IV) and
Infantile Refsum Disease
Adnan Y. Manzur
See also Chapter 106.2.
Refsum disease is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by an
enzymatic block in β-­oxidation of phytanic acid to pristanic acid. Phytanic acid is a branched-­chain fatty acid that is derived mainly from
dietary sources, such as spinach, nuts, and coffee. Levels of phytanic
acid are greatly elevated in plasma, CSF, and brain tissue. Phytanic and
very long-­chain fatty acids may be lipotoxic by impairing mitochondrial function in the central and peripheral nervous systems. The CSF
shows an albuminocytologic dissociation, with a protein concentration of 100-­600 mg/dL. Genetic linkage studies identify two distinct
loci at 10p13 and 6q22-­q24 with PHYH and PEX7 pathogenic variants,
respectively. The infantile form also can be caused by the PEX1, PEX2,
or PEX26 genes, which produce both clinical and biochemical differences from the classic form, and include minor facial dysmorphism,
retinitis pigmentosa, sensorineural hearing loss, hypercholesterolemia,
hepatomegaly, and failure to thrive. Phytanic acid accumulation in
infantile Refsum disease is secondary to a primary peroxisomal disorder; hence, autosomal recessive Refsum disease is really a different
disease.
The clinical onset of classic Refsum disease is usually between 4 and
7 years of age, with intermittent motor and sensory neuropathy. Ataxia,
progressive neurosensory hearing loss, retinitis pigmentosa with loss
of night vision, ichthyosis, and liver dysfunction also develop in various degrees. Skeletal malformations from birth and cardiac findings of
conduction disturbances and cardiomyopathy appear in the majority.
Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities are delayed. Sural nerve
biopsy shows loss of myelinated axons. Treatment is by dietary management and periodic plasma exchange. With careful management, life
expectancy can be normal. Hearing loss due to acoustic nerve involvement may sometimes be improved with cochlear implantation.

653.6 Fabry Disease
Adnan Y. Manzur
See also Chapter 106.4.
Fabry disease, a rare X-­linked recessive trait, results in storage of
ceramide trihexoside because of deficiency of the enzyme ceramide
trihexosidase, which cleaves the terminal galactose from ceramide trihexoside (ceramide-­glucose-­galactose-­galactose), resulting in tissue
accumulation of this trihexoside lipid in central nervous system neurons, Schwann cells and perineurial cells, ganglion cells of the myenteric plexus, skin, kidneys, blood vessel endothelial and smooth muscle
cells, heart, sweat glands, cornea, and bone marrow. It results from a
missense pathogenic variant disrupting the crystallographic structure
of α-­galactosidase A.

Chapter 653 u Hereditary Motor-­Sensory Neuropathies
CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

The presentation is in late childhood or adolescence, with recurrent
episodes of burning pain and paresthesias of the feet and lower legs
so severe that patients are unable to walk. These episodes are often
precipitated by fever or by physical activity. Objective sensory and
motor deficits are not demonstrated on neurologic examination, and
reflexes are preserved. Autonomic nerve involvement is almost universal and may cause cardiac rhythm abnormalities, cutaneous mottling,
and gastrointestinal peristaltic abnormalities; autonomic expression is
variable between patients. Cardiac involvement is not limited to autonomic abnormalities of arrhythmias and conduction defects, but may
also include left ventricular hypertrophy, coronary artery disease, and
valvular infiltrative myopathy. Characteristic skin lesions are seen in
the perineal region, scrotum, buttocks, and periumbilical zone as flat
or raised red-­black telangiectasias known as angiokeratoma corporis
diffusum. Hypohidrosis may be present. Corneal opacities, cataracts,
and necrosis of the femoral heads are inconstant features. Tortuosity
of retinal vessels and of the vertebral and basilar arteries can occur.
The disease is progressive. Hypertension and renal failure are usually
delayed until early adult life. Recurrent strokes result from vascular
wall involvement. Untreated, death often occurs in the fifth decade due
to cerebral infarction or renal insufficiency, but a significant morbidity
already occurs in childhood despite the absence of major organ failure.
Heterozygous female carriers may be asymptomatic or less severely
affected than symptomatic males; corneal opacities involve 70–80%,
though cataracts are rare.

LABORATORY FINDINGS

Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities are normal to only
mildly slow, showing preservation of large, myelinated nerve fibers.
CSF protein is normal. Proteinuria is present early in the course. An
electrochemical skin conductance test is abnormal in the majority of
Fabry patients as an indication of small sensory nerve and autonomic
nerve involvement. Cardiac evaluation should include ECG, echocardiography, and coronary artery assessment in selected cases.
Calcifications often are seen in the pulvinar of the thalamus, as
demonstrated by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and are specific imaging findings, believed
caused by cerebral hyperperfusion. Positron tomography, by contrast, shows reduced cerebral blood flow velocity and impaired
autoregulation because of the glycosphingolipid storage in vascular
endothelial cells.
Pathologic features are usually first detected in skin or sural nerve
biopsy specimens. Electron microscopy demonstrates crystalline
glycosphingolipids, appearing as zebra bodies, in lysosomes of endothelial cells, in smooth myocytes of arterioles, and in Schwann cells.
Nerves show a selective loss of small, myelinated fibers and relative preservation of large-­and medium-­sized axons, in contrast to
most axonal neuropathies, in which large, myelinated fibers are most
involved.
An assay for the deficient enzyme, α-­galactosidase-­A, may be performed from blood leukocytes, skin fibroblasts, and other tissues. This
test may permit detection of the female carrier state; for females, gene
sequencing is preferred.

TREATMENT

See Chapter 106.4 for the specific therapy of Fabry disease, including
enzyme replacement.
Medical therapy of painful neuropathies includes management of
the initiating disease and therapy directed to the neuropathic pain
independent of the etiology. Pain may be burning or associated with
paresthesia, hyperalgesia (abnormal response to noxious stimuli), or
allodynia (induced by nonnoxious stimuli; see Chapter 93). Neuropathic pain is often successfully managed by tricyclic antidepressants;
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are less effective. Anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin, gabapentin, lamotrigine) are effective, as are narcotic and nonnarcotic analgesics. Enzyme replacement
therapy has improved the short-­and long-­term prognosis of the clinical neuropathy and also reverses the increased blood flow velocity in

3887

the brain. Chaperone therapy with migalastat facilitates trafficking and
stabilization of the abnormal enzyme.

653.7 Giant Axonal Neuropathy
Adnan Y. Manzur
Giant axonal neuropathy is a rare autosomal recessive disease with
onset in early childhood. It is a progressive mixed peripheral neuropathy and degeneration of central white matter similar to leukodystrophies (Table 653.6). Ataxia and nystagmus are accompanied by signs
of progressive peripheral neuropathy. A large majority of affected children have frizzy or kinky hair, which microscopically shows variation
in the diameter of the shaft and twisting, similar to that in Menkes
disease; microscopic examination of a few scalp hairs provides a simple
screening tool in suspected cases. Focal axonal enlargements are seen
in both the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system,
but the myelin sheath is intact. The disease is a general proliferation
of intermediate filaments, including neurofilaments in axons, glial filaments (i.e., Rosenthal fibers) in brain, cytokeratin in hair, and vimentin
in Schwann cells and fibroblasts.
Nonsense, missense gene variants, splice site variants, or deletions occur in GAN, with allelic heterogeneity at 16q24. These gene
variants are responsible for defective synthesis of the protein gigaxonin, a member of the cytoskeletal BTB/kelch superfamily, crucial to
linkage between intermediate proteins and the cell membrane. MRI
shows white matter lesions of the brain similar to leukodystrophies
(Fig. 653.1A,B), and MR spectroscopy demonstrates increased ratios
of choline:creatine and myoinositol:creatine, with decreased N-­acetyl
aspartate, indicating demyelination and glial proliferation, as well as
axonal loss. Gigaxonin is expressed in a wide variety of neuronal cell
types and is localized to the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum. GAN gene variants have been demonstrated in human cell lines of
neoplastic cells and also in a variety of tumors.
The diagnosis is suspected clinically based upon a childhood onset
of ataxic gait, findings of neuropathy, and kinky or curly hair (see Fig.
653.1C); it is genetically confirmed by testing of the GAN gene. Pathologic findings of enlarged or swollen axons from peripheral nerve
biopsy are characteristic. Clinically, the onset of symptoms occurs
within the first 5 years of life, and there is progressive ataxia and weakness. As the disease progresses, patients also develop dysphagia, dysarthria, optic neuropathy, respiratory insufficiency, scoliosis (see Fig.
653.1E), and some in later stages will develop seizures. A gene variant
of BAG3, one of several genes associated with myofibrillar myopathy
(see Chapter 648.5), also can cause the finding of giant axons histologically, but clinically it is distinguished from giant axonal neuropathy
caused by pathologic variants in the GAN gene.

653.8 Hypermyelinating (Tomaculous)
Neuropathy; Hereditary Neuropathy
with Liability to Pressure Palsies
Adnan Y. Manzur
This hereditary neuropathy is characterized by redundant overproduction of myelin around each axon in an irregular segmental fashion
so that tomaculous (sausage-­shaped) bulges occur in the individual
myelinated nerve fibers. Other sections of the same nerve can show
loss of myelin. Such nerves are particularly prone to pressure palsies,
and patients, usually beginning in adolescence, present with recurrent or intermittent mononeuropathies secondary to minor trauma or
entrapment neuropathies, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, peroneal

palsies, and even writer’s cramp. Phenotype expression is somewhat
variable. It is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait, with loci
identified at 17p11.2 and 17p12, and deletion of exons in PMP22 (in
some patients, only microdeletions). Duplication of the same 17p12
locus leads to CMT disease type 1A, MPZ gene variants. Sural nerve

biopsy is diagnostic, but special teased fiber preparations should be
made to demonstrate the myelin abnormalities most clearly. Skin or
conjunctival biopsies also may be diagnostic. Electrophysiologic nerve
conduction studies are abnormal but nonspecific. Genetic studies are
definitive.

653.9 Leukodystrophies
Adnan Y. Manzur
Several hereditary degenerative diseases of white matter of the central
nervous system also cause peripheral neuropathy. The most important
are Krabbe disease (globoid cell leukodystrophy), metachromatic leukodystrophy, and adrenoleukodystrophy (see Chapters 106 and 639).
Within the brain, they produce progressive but selective demyelination,
affecting the deep white matter of the centrum semiovale with relative
sparing of U-­fibers around each gyrus. Additional metabolic disorders
associated with peripheral neuropathy are noted in Table 653.2.

653.10 Congenital Hereditary Sensory Pain
Syndromes
Adnan Y. Manzur
Nociception is the result of complex activity in sensory pathways, whereas
pain is the interaction between nociception, cognition, emotion, and
social learning. There are genetic disorders of “nociception,” which
encompass a range of rare conditions and several genes. These are labeled
as “pain” syndromes, which may make clinical assessment difficult.
In understanding genotype-­phenotype pathophysiology, there are
genes encoding the voltage-­dependent sodium channel (Nav channel) 1.7, which is expressed selectively in sensory and autonomic neurons. Inactivating gene variants in SCN9A Nav1.7 result in congenital
insensitivity to pain (see Table 653.5), whereas gain-­of-­function gene
variants produce distinct pain syndromes such as inherited erythromelalgia (IEM), paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD), and small-­
fiber neuropathy (see Table 653.6).

GENETIC DISORDERS WITH INCREASED PAIN
THRESHOLD OR INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN

Congenital insensitivity to pain disorders are diagnosed in infancy or
early childhood (see Chapter 655). Table 653.5 provided a summary
of some of the phenotypes presenting with abnormal deficiencies in
autonomic nervous system function like anhidrosis, recurrent fever,
defective tears, and feeding problems.
The collective term congenital insensitivity to pain has five underlying
causative HSAN. Each are associated with unique clinical features, and all
are autosomal recessive, apart from HSAN I, which is autosomal dominant. Figure 653.2 is a composite illustration of clinical images of patients
with HSAN. These disorders can involve ion channels (channelopathies)
or other key elements of nociception transduction pathways, such as
modulators.

HSAN-­I

HSAN-­I is the most common type of HSAN, and it affects all nerve
fiber types. The consequent clinical and sensory deficits are diminished or absent reflexes, distal loss of proprioception, light touch,
and sensitivity to noxious thermal stimuli. HSAN-­I has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with different causative
pathologic gene variants, which mostly involve the SPTLC1 gene
(HSAN-­IA) and lead to reduced activity of serine palmitoyltransferase (a key enzyme in sphingolipid synthesis).
The disease is evident in late adolescence to the early thirties and features pupillary abnormalities, loss of corneal reflex and abrasions, deafness, restless legs, cramps, absent reflexes, Charcot joints, and development
of painless injuries of the tongue and limbs. The clinical picture may also
be complicated with the occurrence of osteomyelitis and sepsis. In this
instance, the sensory disturbances of nociception are not a consequence
of an ion channel or receptor defect, but down to membrane impairment
in signal transduction and variants in the SPTLC2 gene. Gene variants in
the ATL1 and ATL3 genes (altered synthesis of axonal proteins), as well as
the DNMT1 gene (DNA methylation protein) have also been reported in
HSAN-­I.

HSAN-­II

HSAN-­II has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. The age of
clinical onset is during infancy. HSAN-­II affects all myelinated fibers,

leading to painless tissue damage. Recurring fractures can result in malposition of bones and joints, here represented by a knee joint in a patient with
SCN11A gene variant. The affected genes are indicated, respectively. (From Lischka A, Lassuthova P, Cakar A, et al. Genetic pain loss disorders. Nat

and so the clinical and sensory deficits that characterize this condition
are diminished or absent reflexes, distal loss of proprioception, light
touch, and sensitivity to noxious thermal stimuli.
The four gene variants described are WNK1, FAM134B, KIF1A, and
SCN9A; each are associated with different subtypes of HSAN-­II. The
WNK1 gene variant leads to the HSAN-­IIA phenotype with marked
loss of sensitivity to pressure, proprioception, vibration sensation, and
areflexia, decreased corneal reflexes, diffuse hypotonia, and episodic
hyperhidrosis. WNK1 is involved with organizing sodium and chloride
ion fluxes and cell membrane excitability, as well as coordinating the
expression of TRPV4, which is an important cation channel involved in
nociception. Recessive gene variants in KIF1A, encoding kinesin proteins (axonal transport of synaptic vesicles), can cause other HSAN-­II
disorders with a more complex neurologic picture.

HSAN-­III

HSAN-­III includes Riley-­Day syndrome (familial dysautonomia)
and is typically identified during infancy (see Chapter 655). It affects
both unmyelinated fibers and large myelinated fibers leading to autonomic deficits including hyperhidrosis, defective tears, postural hypotension, recurrent fevers, and significant feeding problems. Reflexes
may be diminished or absent, and the sensory deficits include a general
inability to detect noxious stimuli and a diffuse thermal insensitivity.
Riley-­Day syndrome (familial dysautonomia) is a neurodevelopmental genetic autosomal recessive disorder due to variants in the
IKBKAP or ELP1 gene (9q31.3), which encodes the elongator complex
protein 1 (ELP1). ELP1 is a scaffold protein for the transcription of
neural key proteins and a regulator for different kinases involved in
proinflammatory signaling. There are diffuse changes in pathology that
affect myelinated terminals (usually small nerve fibers), dorsal root
ganglia, spinal cord lateral root entry zones, Lissauer tracts, and parasympathetic afferents.

HSAN-­IV

HSAN-­
IV is a rare condition and typically diagnosed in infancy
because of autonomic dysfunction including anhidrosis and repeated
episodes of fever, and sometimes developmental difficulty. HSAN-­IV
affects both unmyelinated and small myelinated fibers. The reflexes
may be diminished, or absent, and sensory deficits include an inability
to detect noxious stimuli and diffuse thermal insensitivity. This condition is also referred to as congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA). Other possible signs and symptoms are bone lesions, facial
dysmorphology, microcephaly, mandibular osteolysis, dental caries
and premature tooth loss, recurrent soft tissue and bone infections,
urine and fecal incontinence, and growth disturbances.
CIPA is an autosomal recessive condition with a loss-­of-­function
pathogenic variant in the TRKA gene encoding the high-­affinity tyrosine kinase receptor NTRK1 for nerve growth factor (NGF). This gene
is located on chromosome 1 (1q21-­q22) and several mutations have
been reported.

HSAN-­V

HSAN-­V is a very rare autosomal recessive disease that affects only
small-­myelinated fibers; hence, the condition is characterized by distal
insensitivities to noxious and thermal stimuli. HSAN-­V is caused by a
pathologic variant in the NGF-­β gene (chromosome 1p13.2). Because
the NGF-­β gene also binds with the TRKA gene (HSAN-­IV), and is
involved with signaling apoptosis of nociceptive sensory neurons, the
HSAN-­V phenotype can encompass characteristics of HSAN-­IV. There
may be other phenotypes caused by changes in the NGF/TRKA signaling pathway.

GENETIC DISORDERS WITH PAINFUL PERIPHERAL
NEUROPATHIES

The familial forms of painful peripheral neuropathy result from a
pathologic gain of function in ion channel gene variants, i.e., some the
autosomal dominant channelopathies and some inflammatory disorders (see Table 653.6). The other conditions resulting in pain syndromes are listed below.

Familial Episodic Pain Syndrome Type 1

Familial episodic pain syndrome type 1 (FEPS type 1) is an autosomal dominant disorder due to pathologic variants in the TRPA1 gene.
It has only been reported in one family, in Colombia in South America. The family has 21 affected members over 4 generations. Onset is
evident during infancy and characterized by arm and chest pain, tachycardia, and diaphoresis, which is triggered by cold, hunger (fasting), or
physical stress (exertion). Episodes last around 1-­2 hours. There is no
altered pain sensitivity outside the episodes in the affected individuals.
FEPS type 2 is seen in adults: only three reported, from two independent families. The episodes of pain are in the feet. One case developed episodes of burning and intense itch in the feet in middle age;
the patient’s son developed a similar phenotype with allodynia and
hyperalgesia at an earlier age. The third case from a different family
developed stabbing pain in both feet, lower legs, and hands in middle
age. These pain attacks of are not associated with cold or other triggering factors, but warmth sometimes relieves the attack.
FEPS type 3 is an autosomal dominant disorder due to pathologic
variants in the SCN11A gene, producing a small-­fiber painful neuropathy, again seen predominantly in adults. It has been reported in
over 20 families. Infants may present with recurrent episodes of crying due to limb and distal joint pain. Fatigue, intercurrent illnesses,
and weather changes are common triggers. The pain is sometimes
relieved by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Most
affected individuals report that the severe pain episodes diminish
with age.

Paroxysmal Extreme Pain Disorder

PEFD (sometimes called familial rectal pain syndrome) is an autosomal dominant condition with painful neuropathy due to pathologic
gain-­of-­function variants in the SCN9A gene. Pain may begin from
birth and is often stimulated by defecation or perineal stimulation during wiping or use of rectal thermometer. Jaw pain may be provoked
by cold fluids, spicy foods, and emotion; ocular pain may be caused
by cold wind blowing on the face. The pain is severe, paroxysmal, and
associated with harlequin color change, tears, rhinorrhea, and tonic
stiffening episodes, which may be confused with seizures, syncope,
or hyperekplexia. The painful episodes last seconds to a few minutes.
Treatment is difficult and may include carbamazepine, mexiletine, topical lidocaine, and stool softeners (see later).

Inherited Erythromelalgia

IEM, sometimes called erythermalgia, is due to pathologic gain-­of-­
function variants in the SCN9A gene and is characterized by recurrent
episodes of bilateral burning pain, erythema, and swelling primarily of
the feet and hands (see Chapter 211.5). Over time, the face and ears are
involved, and the pain may become constant. It is more commonly evident during childhood, but episodes may begin during infancy. Triggers include a warm environment or prolonged standing. Figure 653.3
illustrates some of the clinical and physiologic features in a patient.
Treatment includes cooling with a fan or ice; but be aware that ice may
produce cold injury if used too often. Medical therapy is similar to that
for PEPD. The differential diagnosis includes Fabry disease (which may
initially present in infancy with painful feet and hands) and secondary
autoimmune causes of erythromelalgia.

Other Pathologic Genetic Variants in SCN2A

Other variants in SCN2A can cause benign familial infantile seizures,
febrile seizures plus syndrome, and intractable epilepsy of infancy. A
gain-­of-­function gene variant is associated with neonatal seizures, episodic ataxia, myoclonus, and pain.

STING-­Associated Vasculopathy Infantile Onset

STING-­
associated vasculopathy infantile onset (SAVI) is a severe
autosomal dominant autoinflammatory disorder due to a pathologic
gain-­of-­function variant in TMEM173, which encodes the STING protein (stimulator of interferon genes). Interferon-­driven inflammation
(interferonopathy) results in painful ulcerating lesions (digits, face,
nose, ears) that become eschars and necrotic. The associated features

rather than late onset (sixth decade; Trp1538Arg). E, Inherited erythromelalgia is not associated with sensory nerve-­fiber degeneration, in contrast
with small-­fiber neuropathy. Epidermal innervations in a healthy individual are detected by immunostaining with the pan-­neuronal marker PGP9.5

shown here. (A, E, F from Bennett DIH, Woods CG. Painful and painless channelopathies. Lancet Neurol. 2014;13:587–599. Fig. 3; B-­D from Cregg R,

include interstitial lung disease, livedo reticularis, Raynaud phenomenon, and elevated inflammatory biomarkers (e.g., erythrocyte
sedimentation rate and C-­reactive protein). The differential diagnosis
includes juvenile idiopathic arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis,
and other infant-­onset autoinflammatory diseases.

Aicardi-­Goutières Syndrome

Aicardi-­Goutières syndrome (AGS) is an autosomal recessive (occasionally autosomal dominant), systemic autoinflammatory interferonopathy that presents in infancy with irritability and progresses to
dystonia, seizures, developmental delay, and progressive microcephaly.

3892 Part XXVI u Neuromuscular Disorders
Some patients may develop systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-­like
symptoms as well as cold-­induced chilblains.

Familial Chilblain Lupus

Familial chilblain lupus (FCL) is another interferonopathy with early
childhood onset of acral lesions (i.e., involving fingers, toes, nose,
cheeks, ears). This disorder is a monogenetic form of cutaneous lupus
with autosomal dominant inheritance (TREX1, SAMHD1, STING gene
variants)

DIAGNOSIS

All HSANs are characterized by absence of the normal axon flare
response to intradermal injection of histamine phosphate (see Chapter
655 for details). There are also descriptions of using nerve conduction
studies in the pain disorders. However, the combination of any concerning clinical features (see Tables 653.5 and 653.6) should prompt genetic
testing. In developed medical settings a combined panel for mendelian
disorders of pain perception, as well as insensitivity to pain or increased
pain perception, should include gene testing for the following disorders:
congenital insensitivity to pain, IEM, PEPD, small fiber neuropathy,
FEPs, HSAN, and forms of HSAN with prominent sensory loss.

TREATMENT
Symptomatic Management of Insensitivity to Pain
Syndromes

Treatment is primarily supportive for conditions like HSAN (see Chapter 655). Neuropathic pain medications like pregabalin or gabapentin
can improve burning, lancinating pains, and symptoms of restless legs
syndrome. Carbidopa, an inhibitor of DOPA-­decarboxylase, blocks
dopamine synthesis outside the brain and is effective in dysautonomic
crisis, and better than benzodiazepines. Unstable hypertension occurring with dysautonomic crisis can be treated with α2-­adrenergic agonists like clonidine and intranasal dexmedetomidine, or diazepam.
Outside of dysautonomic crisis, fluctuations in blood pressure and
orthostatic hypotension require head of the bed elevation to avoid
supine hypertension, while sufficient water and salt intake, compression devices, exercise, and adrenergic agents like midodrine and droxidopa can improve postural hypotension. Counseling is needed to avoid
overheating with the use of cold pack, regular rest, and staying in cool
areas for those with prominent anhidrosis, especially in HSAN-­IV.
Multidisciplinary management is recommended with involvement
of neurology, dermatology, physical and occupational therapy, prosthetics, and orthopedic surgery for optimal skin and limb care. These
teams can provide guidance on foot care including daily examinations
and cleaning, protective footwear with well-­fitted shoes, splinting,
stretching, guided exercise programs, and early treatment of injuries.
For those with tongue ulceration, smoothing incisors is preferable to
dental extraction. Artificial tears, moisture chamber glasses, scleral
lenses, tarsorrhaphy, and cautery of tear ducts should be evaluated
by ophthalmology to protect anesthetic corneas and increase baseline
moisture. Those with early cognitive impairment may benefit from
early special education school programs.

Therapies for Genetic Disabling Pain Syndromes

In general, the disabling pain syndromes do not have effective treatments. However, some patients with voltage-­
gated sodium channel–related FEPS experience pain attacks that may gradually weaken
and diminish with age. A similar age-­dependent reduction in painful
events is seen in patients with TRPA1-­related FEPS type 1. In contrast,
episodic pain does not gradually weaken with age in patients with
Nav1.8-­related FEPS type 2 and Nav1.9-­related FEPS type 3 disorder.
To date, medications such as mexiletine, lidocaine, and carbamazepine have been used as nonselective sodium channel blocking analgesics. There may also be some efficacy in certain pain channelopathies
(e.g., Nav1.7-­related PEPD). Other antiepilepsy medications have been
used with varying effectiveness including lamotrigine, topiramate,
tiagabine, and sodium valproate. However, there are no proven positive
outcomes for these nonselective anti-­epilepsy drugs in FEPS patients;

there is also the problem that analgesic dosing may be accompanied
by central nervous system side effects such as ataxia, confusion, and
sedation.

causes mainly a motor neuropathy selectively involving large nerves,
such as the common peroneal, radial, and median nerves, a condition known as mononeuritis multiplex (see Chapter 761). Arsenic
produces painful burning paresthesias and motor polyneuropathy.
Exposure to industrial and agricultural chemicals is a less common
cause of toxic neuropathy in children than in adults, but insecticides
are neurotoxins for both insects and humans, and if they are used
as sprays in closed spaces, they may be inhaled and induce lethargy,
vomiting, seizures, and neuropathy, particularly with recurrent or
long-­term exposure. Working adolescents and children in developing countries are also at risk. Lithium is widely used in batteries,
as well as in medication for the treatment of psychosis and other
psychiatric conditions, but can be neurotoxic, especially cumulatively over time. Puffer fish poisoning, which can be acquired even
when fish contaminated with the venom has been cooked, produces
a Guillain-­Barré–like syndrome. Ethanol abuse can be neurotoxic

and particularly affects the optic nerves, but optic neuritis is not a
peripheral neuropathy.
The most frequent cause of toxic neuropathies in children is
prescribed medications, though street drugs and even some legal
over-­the-­counter products also can be neurotoxic. Antimetabolic
and immunosuppressive drugs, such as vincristine, cisplatin, and
paclitaxel, produce polyneuropathies as complications of chemotherapy for neoplasms and immunologic disorders, such as juvenile
idiopathic arthritis. This iatrogenic cause is usually an axonal degeneration rather than primary demyelination, unlike primary autoimmune neuropathies. Excessive vitamin intake of megavitamins can be
neurotoxic. Zinc compounds are widely sold without prescription as
dietary supplements and promoted for treatment of a variety of disorders, both neurologic (e.g., hyposmia) and immunologic, and for various visceral organ systems; most claims are not evidence based. Zinc
ions are essential for the conservation of postsynaptic membranes

and mitochondria. Chronic excessive zinc intake is cumulative and
becomes toxic by impairing synaptic activity and mitochondrial
respiratory chain enzymes, especially complex I enzymes, resulting
in polyneuropathy, myopathy, and encephalopathy. Mitochondrial
dysfunction also is a frequent basis of neuropathy in many other toxic
neuropathies.
Chronic uremia is associated with toxic neuropathy and myopathy. The neuropathy is caused by excessive levels of circulating
parathyroid hormone (see Chapter 650). Reduction in serum parathyroid hormone levels is accompanied by clinical improvement
and a return to normal of nerve conduction velocity. Peripheral
nerve axonal damage, particularly of small fibers, can be secondary
to mitochondrial loss or dysfunction in toxic neuropathies. Abnormal toxic complex lipids, generated in Schwann cells by deficient
mitochondrial respiration, are capable of damaging or destroying
neighboring axons, a secondary mitochondrial toxic neuropathy.
Small heat-­shock proteins can be provoked that also may contribute
to toxic neuropathy.

Biologic neurotoxins associated with diphtheria, Lyme disease, West
Nile virus disease, leprosy, herpesviruses (Bell palsy), and rabies also
produce peripheral nerve–induced or ventral horn cell–induced weakness or paralysis. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections also
produce neuropathy, and this infection is particularly prevalent in children in several African countries, including those who emigrate to western countries as refugees. Tick paralysis, botulism, and paralytic shellfish
poisoning cause neuromuscular junction blockade rather than true neuropathy. During the 2020/2021 COVID-­19 pandemic, Guillain Barré
syndrome and peripheral neuropathy were described in association with
SARS-­CoV-­2 infection. The SARS-­CoV-­2–associated peripheral neuropathy was considered to be multifactorial and immune mechanisms,
preexisting risk factors, antiviral drugs, and bedding-­related nerve compression were considered contributing factors. Various inborn errors of
metabolism are also associated with peripheral neuropathy from metabolite toxicity or deficiencies (see Part XI and Table 654.1).

Chapter 655

Autonomic Neuropathies
Monique M. Ryan
Involvement of small, lightly, or unmyelinated autonomic nerve fibers
is seen in many peripheral neuropathies, but their autonomic manifestations are usually mild or subclinical. Some autonomic neuropathies
are more symptomatic, causing disturbances of autonomic regulation
of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, thermoregulatory, sudomotor, and pupillomotor systems.
The differential diagnosis is noted in Table 653.1 (in Chapter 653)
and Tables 655.1-­655.3. Table 655.4 lists the tests useful in assessing
autonomic nervous system function. The treatment of acquired autonomic dysfunction includes both management of the primary disorder
(Guillain-­Barré syndrome, diabetes) and symptomatic management of
organ-­specific manifestations (Table 655.5).

655.1 Familial Dysautonomia
Monique M. Ryan
Familial dysautonomia (Riley-­Day syndrome) is an autosomal recessive disorder most common in Eastern European Jews, in whom its
incidence is 1 in 10,000-­20,000. It is very rare in other ethnic groups
but is, overall, the most common hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy (HSAN). The variant gene, IKBKAP (IκB kinase–associated
protein), is at the 9q31-­q33 locus. Variants in IKBKAP affect the development and maturation of peripheral nerves. This and other autonomic neuropathies are often regarded as neurocristopathies because
the abnormal tissues are largely derived from the neural crest.

PATHOLOGY

This disease of the peripheral nerves is characterized pathologically by
a reduced number of the small unmyelinated nerve fibers that carry
pain, temperature, and taste sensation and mediate autonomic functions, including baroreceptors. There is also loss of small and large
myelinated fibers from peripheral nerves. The dorsal root ganglia are
small, with reduced neurons. The number of parasympathetic ganglion
cells in the myenteric plexuses is reduced. Optic nerve involvement,
with predominant loss of papillomacular nerve fibers, may impair
visual acuity. Fungiform and circumvallate papillae (taste buds) are
absent or reduced in the tongue (Fig. 655.1).

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Clinical manifestations are highly variable. Affected infants and children may be hypotonic, with motor delay and feeding difficulties.
Breath-­holding spells, followed by syncope, are common in the first
5 years of life. Responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia are reduced.
Recurrent pneumonia often leads to chronic lung disease. Affected
persons may experience profound postural hypotension without compensatory tachycardia but can also develop extreme hypertension and
tachycardia when under emotional and/or physical stress. Temperature dysregulation is reflected by the development of hyperthermia or
hypothermia with infections and environmental stressors.
When affected children become older, insensitivity to pain becomes
evident and traumatic injuries are frequent. Pain and temperature sensation are reduced, although to a lesser degree than in other HSANs
(see Table 655.2). Alacrima (absence of tears with emotional crying)
is a universal finding. Corneal ulcerations result from decreased corneal sensation and xerophthalmia. Newly erupting teeth cause tongue
ulcerations and, in older children, dental trauma; soft tissue mutilation may be prominent. Walking is delayed and appears ataxic, probably as a result of a combination of poor sensory feedback from muscle

spindles, vestibular nerve dysfunction, and cerebellar involvement. The
deep tendon reflexes are absent. Scoliosis or kyphosis, or both, is seen
in most patients and is usually progressive. There is an increased incidence of urinary incontinence. Bradycardia and other cardiac arrhythmias can occur; some patients require a cardiac pacemaker.
Approximately 40% of patients experience seizures; some are triggered by hypoxia during breath holding and some by fever, but some
have no obvious precipitants. Emotional lability and learning disabilities are common in school-­age children with familial dysautonomia.
Puberty is often delayed, especially in females. Short stature can occur
but is responsive to treatment with growth hormone.
After 3 years of age, dysautonomic crises begin, usually with attacks
of cyclic vomiting lasting 24-­72 hours or even longer. These repeated
episodes of retching and vomiting are associated with tachycardia,
hypertension, profuse sweating, blotching of the skin, apprehension, and irritability. Prominent gastric distention can occur, causing
abdominal pain and even respiratory distress. Hematemesis can complicate pernicious vomiting.

LABORATORY FINDINGS

ECG shows prolonged corrected QT intervals with lack of appropriate shortening with exercise, reflecting aberrant autonomic regulation
of cardiac conduction. Chest radiographs may show atelectasis and
chronic inflammatory changes. The urinary vanillylmandelic acid level
is decreased, and the homovanillic acid level is increased. The plasma
level of dopamine β-­hydroxylase (the enzyme that converts dopamine
to epinephrine) is diminished. Sural nerve biopsy shows loss of unmyelinated fibers, but nerve conduction studies and electromyography are
often normal, because they reflect only the function of large myelinated
fibers. Electroencephalography is useful for evaluating seizures.

DIAGNOSIS

All HSANs are characterized by absence of the normal axon flare
response to intradermal injection of histamine phosphate. Because the
skin of a normal infant reacts more intensely to histamine, a 1:10,000
dilution should be used. Instillation of 2.5% methacholine into the conjunctival sac produces miosis in patients with familial dysautonomia
but no detectable effect on a normal pupil; this is a nonspecific sign of
parasympathetic denervation from any cause. Methacholine is applied
to only one eye in this test, with the other eye serving as a control; the
pupils are compared at 5-­minute intervals for 20 minutes. The combination of alacrima, absent fungiform papillae, decreased patellar
reflexes, and an abnormal histamine test with Ashkenazi Jewish lineage
is diagnostic. Because of variable expression and potential overlap with
other HSANs, genetic testing should be used to confirm the diagnosis.

TREATMENT

Symptomatic treatment includes special attention to the respiratory and
gastrointestinal systems to prevent aspiration and malnutrition, topical
ocular lubricants to prevent corneal ulceration, orthopedic management
of scoliosis and joint problems, and anticonvulsants where required.
Gastrostomy, with or without fundoplication, should be considered in
those with recurrent aspiration. Hyperpyrexia from anhidrosis can be
life-­threatening and should be treated aggressively. Chronic lung disease should be treated symptomatically. Patients should be warned that
their insensitivity to hypoxia may place them at risk of complications
with underwater swimming, air travel, and travel to high altitudes. Protection from injuries is important because of the lack of pain as a protective mechanism. Some children require a cardiac pacemaker.
Dysautonomic crises respond poorly to standard antiemetics and
are usually treated with centrally acting medications such as diazepam
and clonidine. Carbidopa, a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, is also
effective in dysautonomic crises.

PROGNOSIS

Sixty percent of patients die before the age of 20 years, usually of
chronic respiratory failure or aspiration. Older patients often develop
chronic renal disease related to vasomotor instability and hypertension.
The prognosis is improved by treatment in a center familiar with this

655.2 Other Autonomic Neuropathies
Monique M. Ryan

CONGENITAL INSENSITIVITY TO PAIN AND
ANHIDROSIS

Congenital insensitivity to pain and anhidrosis, or HSAN type
IV, is an autosomal recessive disorder with onset in infancy (see

Table 655.2 and Chapter 653.10). Affected children usually present
with episodes of overheating related to warm environmental temperatures because they have absent or reduced sweating. Infantile
hypotonia improves with age. Frequent burns and traumatic injuries result from the lack of pain perception, which also causes poor
healing of fractures and a tendency for development of chronic
osteomyelitis and Charcot joints. Temperature sensation is also
markedly impaired. Anhidrosis causes a thick, calloused appearance
of the skin, with lichenification of the palms and chronic dystrophic
changes in the nails. There is no alacrima, but corneal ulceration
may result from hypoesthesia. Almost all patients have behavioral
and cognitive deficits. Nerve biopsy reveals an almost total absence
of unmyelinated nerve fibers, which usually convey pain, temperature, and autonomic sensation. The diagnosis is confirmed by targeted genetic testing.

Chapter 656

Guillain-­Barré Syndrome
Monique M. Ryan
Guillain-­Barré syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune disorder that is
thought to be a postinfectious polyneuropathy, involving mainly
motor but also sensory and sometimes autonomic nerves. This syndrome affects people of all ages and is not hereditary. Most GBS patients
in the United States and Europe have a demyelinating neuropathy, but
primarily axonal degeneration is apparent in some forms of GBS seen
mainly in China, Mexico, Bangladesh, and Japan.

The onset of weakness usually follows a nonspecific gastrointestinal
or respiratory infection by approximately 10 days. The original infection might have caused only gastrointestinal (especially Campylobacter
jejuni, but also Helicobacter pylori), respiratory (especially Mycoplasma
pneumoniae), or systemic (Zika virus, COVID-­19) symptoms. Consumption of undercooked poultry, unpasteurized milk, and contaminated water are the main sources of gastrointestinal infections. West
Nile virus also can mimic Guillain-­Barré–like syndrome, but more
often causes a motor neuron disease similar to poliomyelitis. GBS
may follow administration of vaccines against rabies, influenza, and
conjugated meningococcal vaccine, particularly serogroup C. Other
infectious precursors of GBS include mononucleosis, Lyme disease, cytomegalovirus, the Zika virus and, most recently, COVID-­19
infection.
Initial symptoms include numbness and paresthesia, followed by
weakness (Fig. 656.1). Radicular back pain and myalgia are common
in the initial stages; affected children can be very irritable. Weakness
usually begins in the lower extremities and progressively involves the
trunk, the upper limbs, and finally the bulbar muscles, but weakness is
sometimes proximally prominent. Extraocular muscle involvement is
rare, but many children develop facial weakness. In most cases weakness is essentially symmetric. Weakness progresses over days or weeks,
the clinical nadir occurring in less than 4 weeks. Approximately 60%
of children lose the ability to walk at some point in their illness; a small
proportion progress to flaccid tetraplegia. The maximal severity of
weakness is reached by 4 weeks after onset. The differential diagnosis
of GBS is shown in Tables 656.1 and 656.2.
Bulbar involvement occurs in about 50% of cases and can result in
respiratory insufficiency (see Fig. 656.1; Table 656.3). Dysphagia and
facial weakness can be signs of impending respiratory failure, interfere
with saliva control and swallowing, and increase the risk of aspiration.
Vocal cord paralysis may cause dyspnea or a hoarse voice. Severe bulbar and respiratory muscle involvement can lead to death if GBS is not
recognized and treated.
The autonomic nervous system is also involved in some cases. Lability of blood pressure and heart rate, postural hypotension, episodes of
profound bradycardia or tachycardia, and occasional asystole occur
more commonly in younger patients or those with severe weakness.
Cardiovascular monitoring is important, especially early in the disease
course, when rapid progression of weakness, respiratory insufficiency,
and autonomic instability can be life-­threatening. The tendon reflexes
are lost in GBS, usually early, but are sometimes preserved until later;
areflexia is more common but hyporeflexia may be seen. As many as
10% of affected children retain their reflexes throughout their course.
Subtypes of GBS include an acute inflammatory demyelinating
polyneuropathy and an acute motor axonal neuropathy; these are
distinguished by findings on nerve conduction studies and an associated pattern of antiganglioside antibodies (see Table 656.3). Localized
forms of GBS also occur and include a pattern of facial diplegia with
paresthesias and a pattern of pharyngeal-­cervical-­brachial weakness.
Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) is an uncommon GBS variant associated with acute external (and occasionally internal) ophthalmoplegia,
ataxia, and areflexia. The cranial nerve VI is most often involved in
MFS. Although areflexia is seen in MFS, patients have no or only very
mild lower extremity weakness, compared with GBS. Distal paresthesias are common in MFS. Urinary incontinence or retention is seen
in approximately 20% of cases but is usually transient. MFS overlaps
clinically with Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis, which has similar
findings with an associated encephalopathy.
Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy
(CIDP, sometimes called chronic inflammatory relapsing polyneuritis)
is a more chronic, slowly progressive, acquired inflammatory neuropathy with some clinical overlap with GBS (Table 656.4). Symptoms such
as weakness and paresthesias develop over more than 4-­6 weeks, recur
intermittently (relapsing), or progress slowly over periods of months
to years. Weakness is generally both proximal and distal, and variably
severe. Hyporeflexia or areflexia is almost universal. Motor deficits
occur in 94% of cases and sensory paresthesias in 64%, but cranial

Fig. 656.1 Pattern of symptoms in variants of Guillain-­Barré syndrome (GBS). Graphic representation of the pattern of symptoms typically ob-

served in the different clinical variants of GBS. Symptoms can be purely motor, purely sensory (rare), or a combination of motor and sensory. Ataxia
can be present in patients with Miller Fisher syndrome, and both decreased consciousness and ataxia can be present in patients with Bickerstaff
brainstem encephalitis. Symptoms can be localized to specific regions of the body, and the pattern of symptoms differs between variants of GBS.
Although rare, bilateral facial palsy with paresthesias, the pure sensory variant, and Miller Fisher syndrome are included in the GBS spectrum, but
they do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for GBS. (From El-­Abassi RN, Soliman M, Levy MH, et al. Treatment and management of autoimmune

nerve and autonomic involvement is uncommon. The cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) shows no pleocytosis, but the CSF protein is almost always
elevated. Nerve conduction studies show variable slowing of nerve
conduction; where required, sural nerve biopsy shows patchy myelin
loss and focal inflammatory changes. Acute-­onset CIDP may be difficult to distinguish from GBS; CIDP may also be difficult to distinguish
from GBS with treatment-­related symptom fluctuations.
Congenital GBS is very rare, manifesting as generalized hypotonia,
weakness, and areflexia in an affected neonate, fulfilling all electrophysiologic and CSF criteria and in the absence of maternal neuromuscular disease. Treatment is not always required.

LABORATORY FINDINGS AND DIAGNOSIS

CSF studies are helpful in diagnosing GBS. The CSF protein is usually
elevated to more than twice the upper limit of normal, the glucose level
is normal, and there is no pleocytosis; there should be fewer than 10
white blood cells/mm3. Bacterial cultures are negative, whereas viral
studies rarely isolate specific viruses. The dissociation between high
CSF protein and a lack of cellular response (cytoalbuminologic dissociation) in a patient with an acute or subacute polyneuropathy is essentially diagnostic of GBS. These findings may not be apparent in the first
week after the onset of symptoms (Table 656.5).
On MRI of the spinal cord in GBS, typical findings include thickening of the cauda equina and intrathecal nerve roots with gadolinium
enhancement (Fig. 656.2). Atypical findings should prompt consideration of the alternative diagnoses listed in Table 656.1. Imaging in
CIDP is similar but may show greater enhancement of spinal nerve
roots (Fig. 656.3).
Nerve conduction studies and electromyography are sensitive to
early signs of peripheral nerve inflammation in GBS. Motor and sensory
nerve conduction velocities are reduced to a variable extent, reflecting
the patchy nature of nerve involvement in this disorder, which is also
reflected by focal conduction block and dispersed responses. Electromyography may show acute denervation of muscle. Serum creatine
kinase levels may be mildly elevated or normal. Serum antiganglioside
antibodies against GM1 and GD1 are sometimes elevated in GBS, particularly in cases with primarily axonal rather than demyelinating neuropathy, suggesting that they might play a role in disease propagation
and/or recovery in some cases (see Table 656.3). Sural nerve biopsy
shows segmental demyelination, focal inflammation, and Wallerian
degeneration, but is almost never required for diagnosis.
Serologic testing for Campylobacter and Helicobacter infections
helps establish causation if results are positive but does not alter treatment. Stool cultures are rarely positive because the infection is generally self-­limited, and the neuropathy follows the acute gastroenteritis.

TREATMENT

Patients in early stages of GBS should be admitted to the hospital
for observation because the ascending paralysis can rapidly cause
(potentially life-­threatening) respiratory failure and autonomic instability (Fig. 656.4). The respiratory effort (measured by bedside testing
or spirometry) must be monitored for changes predicting onset of
hypoventilation and respiratory failure. Patients with milder weakness and slow progression may be treated expectantly, with observation for stabilization and spontaneous remission. Severe or rapidly

Table 656.5  Diagnostic Criteria for Guillain-­Barré
Syndrome*
FEATURES NEEDED FOR DIAGNOSIS OF GUILLAIN-­BARRÉ
SYNDROME IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
• Progressive weakness in legs and arms (sometimes initially only in legs)
• Areflexia (or decreased tendon reflexes) in weak limbs
ADDITIONAL SYMPTOMS
• Progressive phase lasts days to 4 wk (often 2 wk)
• Relative symmetry
• Mild sensory symptoms or signs (not present in acute motor
axonal neuropathy)
• Cranial nerve involvement, especially bilateral weakness of facial
muscles
• Autonomic dysfunction
• Pain (common)
FEATURES THAT SHOULD RAISE DOUBT ABOUT THE DIAGNOSIS
OF GUILLAIN-­BARRÉ SYNDROME
• CSF: increased number of mononuclear cells or
polymorphonuclear cells (>50 cells/μL)
• Severe pulmonary dysfunction with little or no limb weakness at
onset
• Severe sensory signs with little or no weakness at onset
• Bladder or bowel dysfunction at onset
• Fever at onset
• Sharp spinal cord sensory level
• Marked, persistent asymmetry of weakness
• Persistent bladder or bowel dysfunction
• Slow progression of weakness and without respiratory
involvement (consider subacute inflammatory demyelinating
polyneuropathy or acute-­onset chronic inflammatory
demyelinating polyneuropathy)
NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES
• Can be helpful in clinical practice but are generally not required
to diagnose Guillain-­Barré syndrome
• Essential for classification of Guillain-­Barré syndrome as acute
inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy or acute motor
axonal neuropathy
• Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy: features
of demyelination (decreased motor nerve conduction velocity,
prolonged distal motor latency, increased F-­wave latency,
conduction blocks, and temporal dispersion)
• Acute motor axonal neuropathy: no features of demyelination
(one demyelinating feature in one nerve, if distal CMAP amplitude
is less than 10% LLN, can be found; distal CMAP amplitude
less than 80% LLN in at least two nerves. Transient motor nerve
conduction block might be present.
*Classification of Guillain-­Barré syndrome as either acute inflammatory demyelinating
polyneuropathy or acute motor axonal neuropathy is not required for the diagnosis of
Guillain-­Barré syndrome. Whether acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and
acute motor axonal neuropathy require different treatments is unknown. The amount of
conduction slowing required to define demyelination differs between classification systems.

progressive muscle weakness is treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG); common protocols include IVIG 0.4 g/kg/day for
5 consecutive days or 1 g/kg/day for 2 days. Plasmapheresis and/
or immunosuppressive drugs are alternatives if IVIG is ineffective.
Steroids are not effective for weakness but may help with pain. Supportive care, such as respiratory support, prevention of pressure sores
and constipation, nutritional support, pain management, prevention
of deep vein thrombosis, and treatment of secondary bacterial infections is important.
Neuropathic pain in GBS should be treated aggressively, with narcotic
analgesics where necessary, and with medications such as gabapentin.

CIDP can be treated with either oral or pulsed steroids or IVIG,
with refractory cases often requiring use of other immunosuppressive
medications. Children with relapsing or slowly progressive weakness
often need months to years of therapy, but most eventually achieve a
sustained remission. The outcome is generally good, but some children
have permanent deficits.

PROGNOSIS

GBS is usually a monophasic illness; spontaneous recovery begins
within 2-­3 weeks but can take months. Therapy with IVIG hastens
recovery but not does alter the long-­term outcome. As many as 60% of
affected children become nonambulant during their illness, but most
eventually regain full strength. A minority has some residual weakness, most often of the ankle dorsiflexors. Improvement usually follows
a gradient opposite the direction of involvement, with bulbar function
recovering first and lower extremity weakness resolving last. The tendon reflexes are usually the last function to recover. Clinical features
predicting a severe course and slow (possibly incomplete) recovery
include cranial nerve involvement, the need for ventilatory support,
and maximum disability at the time of presentation. Neurophysiologic
studies do not necessarily predict the long-­term outcome, but children with demyelinating forms of GBS generally recover more quickly
than those with axonal forms. Bulbar and respiratory muscle involvement can lead to death from GBS if the syndrome is not recognized
and treated. Fatigue is the most common long-­term residuum of GBS.
Relapses occur in about 4% of children with GBS and are generally
responsive to immunomodulatory treatment.

can be managed according to the disease phase. Immunotherapy with either intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange is recommended
when the patient cannot walk unaided. Supportive management includes monitoring for disease progression and early intervention when there is
evidence of autonomic dysfunction, respiratory weakness, or bulbar weakness. Due to prolonged immobility, patients are also at risk of deep vein
thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, warranting preventive prophylaxis. After plateau is reached, some patients can have a relapse, which could be
due to treatment-­related fluctuation, or an acute onset of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. (From Shahrizaila N, Lehmann HC,

Chapter 657 u Bell Palsy 3907

Chapter 657

Bell Palsy
Monique M. Ryan
Bell palsy is an acute-­onset peripheral facial nerve palsy that is
not associated with any other cranial nerve neuropathies or brainstem dysfunction. It is a common disorder at all ages from infancy
through adolescence, usually developing suddenly about 2 weeks
after a presumed viral infection. Numerous viruses have been
linked with Bell palsy (Table 657.1). Active or reactivation of herpes simplex or varicella-­zoster virus are the most common causes
of Bell palsy (Fig. 657.1). In Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus), an acute facial nerve palsy is associated with painful
vesicles in the external auditory canal or auricle. Hereditary forms
of Bell palsy are rare. Bell palsy rarely occurs in the context of systemic hypertension or type 1 diabetes mellitus. Unilateral or bilateral facial nerve palsy is often a sign of Lyme disease. In addition,
Lyme-­associated facial palsy is often preceded by fever, malaise,
headache, myalgias or arthralgias, all symptoms uncommon in
idiopathic Bell palsy.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Pain behind the ear may precede weakness, which develops acutely.
Both the upper and lower portions of the face are paretic, and the
corner of the mouth droops. Patients are unable to close the eye on
the affected side and are hence at risk of exposure keratitis. Taste

on the anterior two thirds of the tongue is lost on the involved side
in approximately 50% of cases; this finding helps establish the anatomic limits of the lesion as being proximal or distal to the chorda
tympani branch of the facial nerve. Lacrimation is spared. Facial
numbness and paresthesias are rare, but when present suggest concomitant involvement of the trigeminal nerve. The blood pressure
should always be checked in a child with acute facial weakness.
Imaging is not required for typical Bell palsy. In children less
than 2 years of age or those in whom there is suspicion of other
pathologies because of atypical findings or chronic or recurrent
weakness, MRI of the facial nerve excludes structural lesions causing facial nerve dysfunction. Serology and other viral studies are
generally noncontributory. A full blood count should be considered
to exclude leukemia in younger patients or those with atypical findings. Lyme antibody testing is indicated in children from endemic
areas.
In patients who do not recover within a few weeks, neurophysiologic
examination of the facial nerve helps to determine the severity of the
facial neuropathy and the likely speed of recovery. In chronic cases,
other causes of facial neuropathy should be considered, including
hypertension, diabetes, facial nerve tumors such as schwannomas and
neurofibromas, infiltration of the facial nerve by leukemic cells or by
a rhabdomyosarcoma of the middle ear, brainstem infarcts or tumors,
and traumatic injury of the facial nerve.

TREATMENT

In contrast to adults, the outcome of pediatric Bell palsy is so good
that benefit from treatment with corticosteroids, with or without acyclovir, has not been established, although many centers recommend a
brief course of oral prednisone. In adults, treatment may include steroids plus an antiviral agent (valacyclovir, famciclovir) although this
is controversial, and steroids alone have been beneficial, whereas antiviral agents alone have had no benefit. The combination may provide
improved outcomes. Protection of the cornea with an ocular lubricant
is especially important at night.

PROGNOSIS

Most children experience complete spontaneous recovery from Bell
palsy within a few weeks from onset. A small proportion (<10%)
has some residual facial weakness. Bilateral Bell palsy is rare, but
as many as 15% of children experience recurrent episodes of facial
weakness.
Nerve regrowth is occasionally misdirected, resulting in synkinesis, where activation of one muscle group may produce activation of
another inappropriate muscle group; blinking may result in mouth
twitching, smiling may cause eye blinking, and lacrimation (crocodile tears) may occur while eating. This complication is much less
common in children than adults.

Disorders of the Eye
Chapter 658

Growth and Development
of the Eye
Scott E. Olitsky and Justin D. Marsh
The eye of a normal full-­term infant at birth is approximately 65% of
adult size. Postnatal growth is maximal during the first year, proceeds
at a rapid but decelerating rate until the third year, and continues at a
slower rate thereafter until puberty, after which little change occurs.
The anterior structures of the eye are relatively large at birth but thereafter grow proportionately less than the posterior structures. This
results in a progressive change in the shape of the globe such that it
becomes more spherical.
In an infant, the sclera is thin and translucent, with a bluish tinge.
The cornea is relatively large in newborns (averaging 10 mm) and
attains adult size (nearly 12 mm) by the age of 2 years or earlier. Its
curvature tends to flatten with age, resulting in a progressive change
in the refractive properties of the eye. A normal cornea is perfectly
clear. In infants born prematurely, however, the cornea may have
a transient opalescent haze. The anterior chamber in a newborn
appears shallow, and the angle structures, important in the maintenance of normal intraocular pressure, must undergo further differentiation after birth. The iris, typically light blue or gray at birth
in White individuals, undergoes progressive change of color as the
pigmentation of the stroma increases in the first 6 months of life.
The pupils of a newborn infant tend to be small and are often difficult to dilate. This is the result of an immature iris dilator muscle.
Remnants of the pupillary membrane (anterior vascular capsule)
are often evident on ophthalmoscopic examination, appearing as
cobweb-­like lines crossing the pupillary aperture, especially in preterm infants.
The lens of a newborn infant is more spherical than that of an adult;
its greater refractive power helps to compensate for the relative shortness of the young eye. The lens continues to grow throughout life, as
new peripheral fibers continually push older fibers toward the center
of the lens. With age, the lens becomes progressively denser and more
resistant to the change of shape that occurs during accommodation
(focusing of the lens).
The fundus of a newborn’s eye is less pigmented than that of an
adult; the choroidal vascular pattern is highly visible, and the retinal
pigment pattern often has a fine peppery or mottled appearance. In
some darkly pigmented infants, the fundus has a gray or opalescent
sheen. In a newborn, the macular landmarks, particularly the foveal
light reflex, are less well defined due to incomplete maturation of
the retinal layers. The peripheral retina appears pale or grayish, and
the peripheral retinal vasculature is immature, especially in premature infants. The optic nerve head color varies from pink to slightly
pale, sometimes grayish. Within 4-­6 months, the appearance of the
fundus approximates that of the mature eye.
Superficial retinal hemorrhages may be observed in many newborn infants. These are usually absorbed promptly and rarely leave
any permanent effect. The majority of birth-­related retinal hemorrhages resolve within 2 weeks, with complete resolution of all such
hemorrhages within 4-­6 weeks of birth. Conjunctival hemorrhages

also may occur at birth and are resorbed spontaneously without
consequence.
Remnants of the primitive hyaloid vascular system may appear as
small tufts or wormlike structures projecting from the disc (Bergmeister papilla) or as a fine strand traversing the vitreous; in some cases,
only a small dot (Mittendorf dot) remains on the posterior aspect of
the lens capsule.
An infant’s eye is somewhat hyperopic (farsighted). The general trend is for hyperopia to increase from birth until age 7 years.
Thereafter, the level of hyperopia tends to decrease rapidly until
age 14 years. Elimination of the hyperopic state may occur during this time. If the process continues, a child may become myopic
(nearsighted). A slower continuation of the decrease in hyperopia,
or increase in myopia, continues into the third decade of life. The
refractive state at any time in life depends on the net effect of many
factors: the size of the eye, the state of the lens, and the curvature
of the cornea.
Newborn infants tend to keep their eyes closed much of the time,
but normal newborns can see, respond to changes in illumination,
and fixate points of contrast. The visual acuity in newborns is estimated to be approximately 20/400. This poor vision is a result of the
immature, multilayered foveal anatomy. Retinal development continues postnatally, maturing completely during the first few years of
life. One of the earliest responses to a formed visual stimulus is an
infant’s regard for the mother’s face, evident especially during feeding. By 2 weeks of age, an infant shows more sustained interest in
large objects, and by 8-­10 weeks of age, a normal infant can follow
an object through an arc of 180 degrees. The acuity improves rapidly and may reach 20/30-­20/20 by the age of 2-­3 years.
Many normal infants may have imperfect coordination of the eye
movements and alignment during the early days and weeks, but proper
coordination should be achieved by 3-­6 months, usually sooner. Persistent deviation of an eye in an infant at 6 months of age requires
evaluation.
Tears often are not present with crying until after 1-­3 months.
Preterm infants have reduced reflex and basal tear secretion, which
may allow topically applied medications to become concentrated
and lead to rapid drying of their corneas.

Examination of the Eye
Scott E. Olitsky and Justin D. Marsh
The eye exam is a routine part of pediatric well childcare, which
begins in the newborn period. The primary care physician plays a
critical role in the detection of both obvious and insidious asymptomatic eye diseases. School and community screening programs can
also be effective in identifying problems at an early age. The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends preschool vision
screening during well child visits as a means of reducing preventable
visual loss (Table 659.1). Referrals to an ophthalmologist should be

3910 Part XXVII u Disorders of the Eye
made when a significant ocular abnormality or visual acuity deficit is
suspected. An ophthalmologist should also examine high-­risk children, such as those with a family history of eye disease, or various
systemic or genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome or juvenile
idiopathic arthritis.
The basic eye exam, whether performed by a pediatrician or an ophthalmologist, must include visual acuity and visual field testing, assessment of pupils, ocular motility and alignment, a general external/facial
examination, and finally, examination of the media and fundus via
ophthalmoscopy.
The periodicity for visual assessment should occur beginning
in the newborn to 6 month age group and continue at ages 6-­12
months, 1-­3 years, 4-­5 years, and 6 years and older. The assessments
include an ocular history, inspection of the lids and eyes, red reflex
testing, pupil examination, ocular motility testing, and assessment
of visual acuity.
When indicated, biomicroscopy (slit-­lamp examination), cycloplegic refraction, and tonometry are performed by an ophthalmologist.
Special diagnostic procedures, such as ultrasound, fluorescein angiography, electroretinography, or visual evoked response testing, are also
indicated for specific conditions.

VISUAL ACUITY

There are various means of assessing visual acuity in the pediatric population. A child’s age and ability to cooperate, as well as clinician preference, all factor into deciding which test to use. The most common
visual acuity test in infants is an assessment of their ability to fixate
and follow a target. If appropriate targets are used, this response can be
demonstrated by approximately 6 weeks of age.
The test begins by seating the child comfortably in the caretaker’s
lap. The object of visual interest, usually a bright-­colored toy or target
with lights, is slowly moved to the right and to the left. The examiner
observes whether the infant’s eyes turn toward the object and follow
its movements. The examiner can use a thumb or palm of the hand to
occlude one of the infant’s eyes to test each eye separately. Although
a sound-­producing object might compromise the purity of the visual
stimulus, in practice, toys that squeak or rattle heighten an infant’s
awareness and interest in the test.
The human face is a better target than test objects. The examiner
can exploit this by moving his or her face slowly in front of the infant’s
face. If the appropriate following movements are not elicited, the test
should be repeated with the caretaker’s face as the test stimulus. It
should be remembered that even children with poor vision can follow a large object without apparent difficulty, especially if only one
eye is affected.
An objective measurement of visual acuity is usually possible
when children reach the age of 2.5-­3 years. Children this age are
tested using a schematic picture or other illiterate eye chart. Examples include Allen or Lea symbols and tumbling E. Each eye should
be tested separately. It is essential to prevent peeking. The examiner
should hold the occluder in place and observe the child throughout
the test. The child should be reassured and encouraged throughout
the test because many children are intimidated by the process and
fear a “bad grade” or punishment for errors. In addition, many children may be too timid to verbally identify figures being tested and
may be more willing to participate if given the opportunity to match
the presented symbols to identical symbols provided on a handout
during the exam. Matching is often preferred at this age, particularly
in randomized control trials, because it also allows the clinician to
test visual acuity using letters instead of figures, even if a child has not
yet learned the alphabet.
An adult-­type Snellen acuity chart can be used at 5-­6 years of age if
the child knows letters. A visual acuity of 20/40 is generally accepted as
normal for 3-­year-­old children. At 4 years of age, 20/30 is acceptable.
By 5 or 6 years of age, most children attain 20/20 vision.
Optokinetic nystagmus (the response to a sequence of moving targets; “railroad” nystagmus) can also be used to assess vision; this can
be calibrated by targets of various sizes (stripes or dots) or by a rotating
drum (known as an OKN drum) at specified distances.

The visual evoked response, an electrophysiologic method of evaluating the response to light and special visual stimuli, such as calibrated
stripes or a checkerboard pattern, can also be used to study visual function in selected cases.
Preferential looking tests are used for evaluating vision in infants
and children who cannot respond verbally to standard acuity tests.
This is a behavioral technique based on the observation that, given a
choice, an infant prefers to look at patterned rather than unpatterned
stimuli. Because these tests require the presence of a skilled examiner,
their use is often limited to research protocols involving preverbal
children.

VISUAL FIELD ASSESSMENT

Visual field assessment must be geared to a child’s age and abilities.
Formal visual field examination (perimetry and scotometry) can often
be accomplished in school-­age children. In younger children and in
the pediatrician’s office, the examiner must often rely on confrontation techniques and finger counting in quadrants of the visual field. In
many such children, only testing by attraction can be accomplished;
the examiner observes a child’s response to familiar objects brought
into each of the four quadrants of the visual field of each eye in turn.
The child’s bottle, a favorite toy, and lollipops are particularly effective
attention-­getting items. These gross methods can often detect diagnostically significant field changes such as the bitemporal hemianopia of a
chiasmal lesion or the homonymous hemianopia of a cerebral lesion.

COLOR VISION TESTING

Color vision testing can be accomplished when a child is able to name
or trace the test figures, which include numbers, shapes, or other symbols. The common color vision testing tools include Ishihara color
plates or Hardy Rand Littler. Color vision testing is not frequently necessary in young children; however, parents may request testing, particularly if their child seems to be slow in learning colors or if there is a
family history of color vision deficiency. It is important to keep in mind
and reassure parents that “color-­deficient” children do not misname
colors, and that true “color blindness” is very rare and not compatible
with normal vision. Color deficiency is common in male patients but
rare in females because the gene is transmitted in an X-­linked manner.
Achromatopsia, which may be encountered occasionally, is a condition of complete color blindness associated with subnormal visual acuity, nystagmus, and photophobia.
Color discrimination is a means of assessing the intensity of a hue,
typically red. Patients describe the intensity of red depicted from the
test object. A change in color discrimination (often referred to as color
“desaturation”) can be a sign of optic nerve or retinal disease.

PUPILLARY EXAMINATION

The pupil exam includes evaluations of both the direct and consensual
responses to light, accommodation (a near target), and reduced illumination, noting the size and symmetry of the pupils under each testing
condition. Special care must be taken to differentiate the reaction to
light from the reaction to near gaze. A child’s natural tendency is to
look directly at the approaching light, inducing the near gaze reflex
when one is attempting to test only the reaction to light; accordingly,
every effort must be made to control fixation on a distance target. The
swinging flashlight test is especially useful for detecting unilateral or
asymmetric prechiasmatic afferent defects in children (see “Marcus
Gunn Pupil” in Chapter 662).

OCULAR MOTILITY

Ocular motility testing assesses alignment and extraocular muscle
function. This is tested by having a child follow an object in various
positions of gaze, known as the cardinal positions. The cardinal positions are those in which one extraocular muscle predominantly functions and a deficit can be identified if present. Movements of each eye
individually (ductions) and of the two eyes together (versions, conjugate movements, and convergence) are assessed.
Alignment can be assessed in two ways. The first is symmetry of the
corneal light reflexes. The second method is to occlude each eye in an

alternating fashion and observe for a change in fixation of the viewing
eye (see discussion on cover testing for strabismus in Chapter 663).

BINOCULAR VISION

Attaining binocular visual function is one of the primary goals of
amblyopia therapy and ocular realignment surgery. Just as there are
multiple methods for assessing visual acuity, there are various means
of testing the level of binocular vision. The Titmus test is probably the
most frequently used test; a series of three-­dimensional images are
shown to the child while he or she wears a set of polarized glasses. The
level of difficulty with which these images can be detected correlates
with the degree of binocular vision present.

EXTERNAL EXAMINATION

The external examination begins with general inspection, paying close attention to size, shape, and symmetry of the orbits, in

addition to the position and movement of the lids and position
and symmetry of the globes. Viewing the eyes and lids in such a
manner aids in detecting orbital asymmetry, lid masses, proptosis (exophthalmos), and abnormal pulsations. Palpation is also
important in detecting orbital and lid masses. Orbital dermoids
and capillary hemangiomas are frequently evaluated during the
external examination.
The lacrimal system is assessed by looking for evidence of tear
deficiency, overflow of tears (epiphora), erythema, and swelling in
the region of the tear sac or gland. The lacrimal gland is located
in the superotemporal orbit, beneath the eyebrow. The tear drainage system, which includes the lacrimal sac, is located within the
medial wall of the orbit, where the eyelids meet the bridge of the
nose. The sac is massaged to check for reflux when obstruction
is suspected. The presence and position of the puncta are also
checked.

3912 Part XXVII u Disorders of the Eye
The lids and conjunctivae are specifically examined for focal
lesions, foreign bodies, and inflammatory signs; loss and misdirection of lashes should also be noted. When necessary, the lids can be
everted in the following manner: (1) instruct the patient to look down;
(2) grasp the lashes of the patient’s upper lid between the thumb and
index finger of one hand; (3) place a probe, a cotton-­tipped applicator, or the thumb of the other hand at the upper margin of the tarsal
plate; and (4) pull the lid down and outward and evert it over the
probe, using the instrument as a fulcrum. Foreign bodies commonly
lodge in the concavity just above the lid margin and are exposed only
by fully everting the lid.
The anterior segment of the eye is then evaluated with oblique focal
illumination, noting the luster and clarity of the cornea, the depth and
clarity of the anterior chamber, and the features of the iris. Transillumination of the anterior segment aids in detecting opacities and in demonstrating atrophy or hypopigmentation of the iris; these latter signs
are important when ocular albinism is suspected. When necessary,
fluorescein dye can be used to aid in diagnosing abrasions, ulcerations,
and foreign bodies.

BIOMICROSCOPY (SLIT-­LAMP EXAMINATION)

The slit-­lamp exam provides a highly magnified view of the various structures of the eye and an optical section through the media
of the eye—the cornea, aqueous humor, lens, and vitreous. Lesions
can be identified and localized according to their depth within the
eye; the resolution is sufficient to detect individual inflammatory
cells in the aqueous and anterior vitreous. With the addition of
special lenses and prisms, the angle of the anterior chamber and
components of the fundus also can be examined with a slit lamp.
Biomicroscopy is often crucial in trauma and in examining for
iritis. It is also helpful in diagnosing many metabolic and genetic
diseases of childhood.

FUNDUS EXAMINATION (OPHTHALMOSCOPY)

The ideal setting for ophthalmoscopy is with a well-­dilated pupil
unless there are neurologic or other contraindications. Tropicamide (Mydriacyl) 0.5–1% and phenylephrine (Neo-­Synephrine)
2.5% are recommended as mydriatics of short duration. These
are safe for most children, but the possibility of adverse systemic
effects must be recognized. For very small infants, especially 6
months or younger, more dilute preparations may be advisable.
Beginning with posterior landmarks, the disc, the macula, and the
four quadrants are systematically examined by following each of
the major vessel groups to the periphery. Retinal hemorrhages,
vascular anomalies, and posterior uveitis are often appreciated
during this segment of the examination. Color, cup, and contour
of the optic nerve should be noted as well. Abnormalities are frequently followed with further imaging studies such as a CT or MRI
or diagnostic testing such as automated perimetry (see “Visual
Field Assessment” earlier). The midperipheral retina can be seen
if a child is directed to look up and down and to the right and left.
Even with care, only a limited fraction of the fundus can be seen
with a direct or handheld ophthalmoscope. For examination of the
far periphery, an indirect ophthalmoscope is used, and full dilation
of the pupil is essential.

REFRACTION

Refraction determines the focusing power of the eye: the degree
of nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hypermetropia), or
astigmatism. Retinoscopy provides an objective determination of
the amount of correction needed and can be performed at any age,
including the newborn period. In young children, it is best done
with cycloplegia using cyclopentolate 1% eye drops in an ophthalmologist’s office. Subjective refinement of refraction involves
asking patients for preferences in the strength and axis of corrective lenses; it can be accomplished in many school-­age children.
Refraction and determination of visual acuity with appropriate
corrective lenses in place are essential steps in deciding whether a
patient has a visual defect or amblyopia. Photoscreening cameras
aid ancillary medical personnel in screening for refractive errors in

preverbal children. The accuracy and practical usefulness of these
devices are still being investigated.

TONOMETRY

Tonometry is the method of assessing intraocular pressure. It may
be performed with a portable, stand-­alone instrument or by the
applanation method during slit-­
lamp examination. Alternative
methods are pneumatic, electronic, or rebound tonometry. When
accurate measurement of the pressure is necessary in a child who
cannot cooperate, it may be performed with sedation or general
anesthesia. A gross estimate of pressure can be made by palpating
the globe with the index fingers placed side by side on the upper lid
above the tarsal plate.

Abnormalities of
Refraction and
Accommodation
Scott E. Olitsky and Justin D. Marsh
Emmetropia is the normal state in which parallel rays of light come
to focus on the retina with the eye at rest (nonaccommodating). Even
though such an ideal optical state is common, the opposite condition,
ametropia, often occurs. Three principal types of ametropia exist:
hyperopia (farsightedness), myopia (nearsightedness), and astigmatism (Fig. 660.1). Most children are physiologically hyperopic at birth.
Nevertheless, myopia and astigmatism may develop early in childhood,
particularly when associated with previous prematurity or numerous
medical diagnoses. With growth, the refractive state tends to change
and should be evaluated periodically.
Measurement of the refractive state of the eye (refraction) can be
accomplished both objectively and subjectively. The objective method
involves directing a beam of light from a retinoscope onto a patient’s
retina. Using loose lenses of various strengths held in front of the eye,
the retinal light reflex (viewed through the pupil) can be neutralized,
yielding a precise refraction. An objective refraction is obtainable at
any age because it requires no response from the patient. In infants
and children, it is generally more accurate to perform a refraction
after instillation of eye drops that produce mydriasis (dilation of the
pupil) and cycloplegia (paralysis of accommodation); those used most
commonly are tropicamide (Mydriacyl), cyclopentolate (Cyclogyl),
and atropine sulfate. A subjective refraction involves placing lenses in
front of the eye and having the patient report which lenses provide the
clearest image of the letters on a chart. This method is dependent on
a patient’s ability to discriminate and communicate, but it can be used
for some children and may be helpful in determining the best refractive
correction for children who are developmentally capable.

HYPEROPIA

If parallel rays of light come to focus posterior to the retina with the eye
in a neutral state, hyperopia or farsightedness exists. This may result
from a shorter anteroposterior diameter of the eye or a lower refractive
power of the cornea or lens.
In hyperopia, the additional refracting power needed to bring
objects into focus at distance and near is generated through the accommodative mechanism. If the accommodative effort required for focus
is within that child’s accommodative amplitude, the vision is clear. In

distant object are focused on the photoreceptors. B, When a closer object is viewed, the image is in focus behind the photoreceptors. The image can
be brought forward into focus on the photoreceptors by the process of accommodation—increasing the optical power of the lens (C). In hyperopic eyes
(D), the eye is too short, and the image of a distant object is focused behind the photoreceptors and can be brought into focus by accommodation.
Myopic eyes are eyes that have grown too long (E), and the image of a distant object falls in front of the photoreceptors and cannot be brought into
focus by accommodation. When closer objects are viewed, the image moves back toward the photoreceptors, and at a certain distance (the far point),
which is related inverse to the severity of the myopia, it comes into focus (F). Closer objects can then be brought into focus using accommodation.
Optical correction for myopia is achieved with concave (diverging) lenses, which move the image into focus on the photoreceptors (G). Contact lenses
work in a similar way, whereas refractive surgery reduces the power of the cornea to bring the image of distant objects into focus. For equal corneal
power, myopic eyes have longer axial lengths than emmetropic eyes, with deeper anterior and vitreal chambers. Their lenses tend to be thinner and
of lower power than those of emmetropic eyes. (From Morgan IG, Ohno-­Matusi K, Saw SM. Myopia. Lancet. 2012;379:1739-­1746, Fig. 1, p. 1740.)

3914 Part XXVII u Disorders of the Eye
high degrees of hyperopia requiring greater accommodative effort,
vision may be blurred, and the child may complain of eyestrain, headaches, or fatigue. Squinting, eye rubbing, and lack of interest in reading
are frequent manifestations. If the induced discomfort is great enough,
a child may not make the effort to focus and may develop bilateral
amblyopia (ametropic amblyopia). Esotropia may also be associated
(see discussion on convergent strabismus, accommodative esotropia in
Chapter 663). Convex lenses (spectacles or contact lenses) of sufficient
strength to provide clear vision and comfort are prescribed when indicated. Even children who have high degrees of hyperopia but who have
good vision will happily wear glasses because they provide comfort by
eliminating the excessive accommodation required to see well. Preverbal children should also be given glasses for high levels of hyperopia
to prevent the development of esotropia or amblyopia. Children with
normal levels of hyperopia do not require correction in the majority
of cases.

MYOPIA

In myopia, parallel rays of light come to focus anterior to the retina.
This is a result of either a long anteroposterior diameter of the eye or a
higher refractive power of the cornea or lens. The principal symptom
is blurred vision for distant objects. The far point of clear vision varies
inversely with the degree of myopia; as the myopia increases, the far
point of clear vision moves closer to the eye. For example, an individual
with one diopter of myopia has a far point of clear focus that is 1 m
from the eye. Any object located farther than 1 m from the eye will
begin to appear blurry. Similarly, for an individual with 3 diopters of
myopia, the far point of clear vision is now ⅓ m from the eye, as the
far point is the inverse of the power of myopia, as measured in meters.
Thus myopic children tend to hold objects and reading material closer,
prefer to be close to the blackboard, and may be uninterested in distant
activities. Squinting is common because the visual acuity is improved
when the lid aperture is reduced, also known as the pinhole effect.
Myopia is infrequent in infants and preschool-­age children. It is
more common in infants with a history of retinopathy of prematurity. A hereditary tendency to myopia is also observed, and children
of myopic parents should be examined at an early age. Nonsyndromic
myopia is associated in some families with variants in the high-­grade
myopia-­1 locus (MYP1) as well as in SLITRK6 and RASGRF1 genes.
The incidence of myopia increases during the school years, especially
during the preteen and teen years. The degree of myopia also increases
with age during periods of rapid growth.
Concave lenses (spectacles or contact lenses) of appropriate strength
are provided to allow for clear vision. Changes are usually needed
periodically, from every few months to every 1-­2 years. Globally the
prevalence of myopia appears to be increasing, leading to heightened
interest in myopia prevention treatment. Numerous therapies, including cycloplegic agents (topical atropine sulfate), peripheral defocus
contact lenses, and reading addition spectacle lenses (bifocal lenses)
are under investigation in an attempt to prevent or slow the progression of myopia.
Excimer laser correction for myopia has been approved for adults
since 1995. The laser is applied to the corneal stroma to reshape the
cornea, changing its refractive power (Fig. 660.2). Laser-­assisted in
situ keratomileusis (LASIK) uses either a microkeratome or a femtosecond laser to produce an epithelial-­stromal flap, permitting the
underlying corneal tissue to be ablated. The flap is then reseated and
assumes the altered corneal shape. Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK)
requires manual removal of the epithelium after treatment with alcohol
to expose the Bowman layer and stroma, allowing the corneal surface
to then be treated by the excimer laser. The epithelium regenerates to
cover the defect over a period of 4-­10 days. Reduction or elimination of
refractive error is usually significant and remains stable over time. Risks
are greatest with high degrees of myopia (>10 diopters) and include
starbursts, halos, and distorted images or multiple images (usually at
night). Refractive surgery is not approved for pediatric patients but is
occasionally used off-­label to treat certain forms of amblyopia or other
high refractive error states in children who are unable to wear proper
refractive correction.

In most cases, myopia is not a result of pathologic alteration of the
eye and is referred to as simple or physiologic myopia. Some children
may have pathologic myopia, a rare condition caused by a pathologically abnormal axial length of the eye; this is usually associated with
thinning of the sclera, choroid, and retina and often with some degree
of uncorrectable visual impairment. Tears or breaks in the retina may
occur as it becomes increasingly thin, leading to the development of
retinal detachments. Myopia may also occur as a result of other ocular
abnormalities, such as keratoconus, ectopia lentis, congenital stationary night blindness, and glaucoma. Myopia is also a major feature of
Stickler syndrome, a genetic disorder of connective tissue involving
problems with vision, hearing, and facial and skeletal development;
it is also common in Marfan syndrome, homocystinuria, and Weill-­
Marchesani syndrome.

ASTIGMATISM

In astigmatism, the refractive powers of the various meridians of the eye
differ. Most cases are caused by irregularity in the curvature of the cornea, although some astigmatism results from changes in the lens. Mild
degrees of astigmatism are common and may produce no symptoms.
With greater degrees, distortion of vision can occur. To achieve a clearer
image, a person with astigmatism uses accommodation or squints to
obtain a pinhole effect. Symptoms include eyestrain, headache, and
fatigue. Cylindrical or spherocylindrical lenses are used to provide optical correction when indicated. Glasses may be needed constantly or only
part time, depending on the degree of astigmatism and the severity of the
attendant symptoms. In some cases, contact lenses are used.
Infants and children with corneal irregularity resulting from injury,
ptosis, or hemangiomas of the periorbita or eyelid are at increased risk
of astigmatism and associated amblyopia.

ANISOMETROPIA

When the refractive state of one eye is significantly different from the
refractive state of the other eye, anisometropia exists. If uncorrected,
one eye may always be out of focus, leading to the development of
amblyopia. Early detection and correction are essential if normal visual
development in both eyes is to be achieved.

ACCOMMODATION

During accommodation, the ciliary muscle contracts, the suspensory
fibers of the lens relax, and the lens assumes a more rounded shape,
adding power to the lens. The amplitude of accommodation is greatest during childhood and gradually diminishes with age. The physiologic decrease in accommodative ability that occurs with age is called
presbyopia.
Disorders of accommodation in children are relatively rare. Premature presbyopia is occasionally encountered in young children. The
most common cause of paralysis of accommodation in children is

intentional or inadvertent use of cycloplegic substances, topically or
systemically; included are all the anticholinergic drugs and poisons, as
well as plants and plant substances having these effects. Neurogenic
causes of accommodative paralysis include lesions affecting the oculomotor nerve (third cranial nerve) along any part of its course. Differential diagnoses include tumors, degenerative diseases, vascular lesions,
trauma, and infectious etiologies. Systemic disorders that may cause
impairment of accommodation include botulism, diphtheria, Wilson
disease, diabetes mellitus, and syphilis. Adie tonic pupil may also lead
to a deficiency of accommodation after some viral illnesses (see Chapter 662). An apparent defect in accommodation may be psychogenic in
origin; it is common for a child to feign inability to read when it can be
demonstrated that visual acuity and ability to focus are normal.

Disorders of Vision
Scott E. Olitsky and Justin D. Marsh
Severe visual impairment (corrected vision poorer than 6/60) and
blindness in children have many etiologies and may be caused by multiple defects affecting any structure or function along the visual pathways
(Tables 661.1, 661.2, 661.3). The overall incidence is approximately
2.5/100,000 children; the incidence is higher in developing countries,
in low birthweight infants, and in the first year of life. The most common causes occur during the prenatal and perinatal time periods; the
cerebral-­visual pathways, optic nerve (hypoplasia, atrophy), and retinal (Leber amaurosis) sites are most often affected. Important prenatal causes include microphthalmia/anophthalmia as well as autosomal
recessive (most common), autosomal dominant, and X-­linked genetic
disorders and hypoxia or chromosomal syndromes. Perinatal/neonatal
causes include retinopathy of prematurity, hypoxia-­ischemia, and infection. Severe visual impairment starting in older children may be due to
central nervous system or retinal tumors, infections, hypoxia-­ischemia,
injuries, neurodegenerative disorders, or juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

AMBLYOPIA

This is a decrease in visual acuity, unilateral or bilateral, that occurs in
visually immature children as a result of a lack of a clear image projecting onto the retina. The unformed retinal image may occur secondary to a deviated eye (strabismic amblyopia), an unequal need for
vision correction between the eyes (anisometropic amblyopia), a high
refractive error in both eyes (ametropic amblyopia), or a media opacity within the visual axis (deprivation amblyopia).
The development of visual acuity normally proceeds rapidly in
infancy and early childhood. Anything that interferes with the formation of a clear retinal image during this early developmental period can
produce amblyopia. Amblyopia occurs only during the critical period
of development before the cortex has become visually mature, within
the first decade of life. The younger the child, the more susceptible he
or she is to the development of amblyopia.
The diagnosis of amblyopia is confirmed when a complete ophthalmologic examination reveals reduced acuity that is unexplained by an
organic abnormality. If the history and ophthalmologic examination
do not support the diagnosis of amblyopia in a child with poor vision,
consideration must be given to other causes (neurologic, psychologic).
Amblyopia is usually asymptomatic and can avoid detection until vision
screening, which may delay diagnosis as screening programs often target school-­age children. This is problematic because amblyopia is more
resistant to treatment at an older age, being reversed more rapidly in
younger children whose visual system is less mature. Thus one key to
the successful treatment of amblyopia is early detection and prompt
intervention.

3915

Most often, treatment first consists of removing any media opacity or
prescribing appropriate glasses, if needed, so that a well-­focused retinal
image can be produced in each eye. The sound eye is then covered (occlusion therapy) or blurred with glasses (fogging) or drops (penalization
therapy) to stimulate proper visual development of the more severely
affected eye. Occlusion therapy may provide a more rapid improvement
in vision, but some children may better tolerate atropine penalization.
The best treatment for any one patient should be selected on an individual
basis. The goals of treatment should be thoroughly understood and the
treatment carefully supervised. Close monitoring of amblyopia therapy
by an ophthalmologist is essential, especially in the very young, to avoid
deprivation amblyopia in the good eye. Many families need reassurance
and support throughout the trying course of treatment. Although full-­
time occlusion has historically been considered the best way to treat children with amblyopia, a series of prospective studies has shown that some
children can achieve similar results with part-­time patching, or the use
of atropine drops. Historical thought was that older children would not
respond to amblyopia therapy. Studies suggest older children and adolescents deemed visually mature who demonstrate amblyopia, particularly
refractive or anisometropic in etiology, can demonstrate improvement in
vision with appropriate therapy.

DIPLOPIA

Diplopia, or double vision, is generally a result of a misalignment of the
visual axes. Occluding either eye relieves the diplopia if it is binocular in
origin. Affected children commonly squint, cover one eye with a hand,
or assume an abnormal head posture (a face turn or head tilt) to alleviate
the bothersome sensation. These behaviors, especially in preverbal children, are important clues to diplopia. The onset of diplopia in any child
warrants prompt evaluation; it may signal the onset of a serious problem
such as increased intracranial pressure, a brain tumor, infection (Lyme disease), migraine, Guillain-­Barré syndrome, or an orbital mass (Fig. 661.1).
Monocular diplopia is less common and results from refractive error,
dislocation of the lens, cataract, dry eyes, or some defect in the media
or macula. With this type of diplopia, occluding the nondiplopic eye
will not relieve the symptoms. Monocular diplopia may also often have
psychologic causes.

SUPPRESSION

In the presence of strabismus, diplopia occurs secondary to the same
image falling on different regions of the retina in each eye. In a visually
immature child, a process may occur in the cortex that eliminates the
disability of seeing double. This is an active process and is termed suppression. It typically only develops in children. Although suppression
eliminates the annoying symptom of diplopia, frequent suppression
may not only place the patient at risk for amblyopia but also increase
the risk for worsening strabismus. Once suppression develops, it may
allow an intermittent strabismus to become constant or strabismus to
redevelop later in life, even after successful treatment during childhood.

AMAUROSIS

Amaurosis is partial or total loss of vision; the term is usually reserved
for profound impairment, blindness, or near blindness. When amaurosis exists from birth, primary consideration in the differential diagnosis
must be given to developmental malformations, damage consequent to
gestational or perinatal infection, anoxia or hypoxia, perinatal trauma,
and the genetically determined diseases that can affect the eye itself or
the visual pathways (see Table 661.3). Often the reason for amaurosis can
be readily determined by objective ophthalmic examination; examples
are severe microphthalmia, corneal opacification, dense cataracts, chorioretinal scars, macular defects, retinal dysplasia, and severe optic nerve
hypoplasia. In other cases, an intrinsic retinal disease may not be apparent on initial ophthalmoscopic examination, or the defect may involve
the brain and not the eye. Neuroradiologic (MRI or CT) and electrophysiologic (electroretinography) evaluation are helpful in these cases.
Amaurosis that develops in a child who once had useful vision has
different implications. In the absence of obvious ocular disease (cataract, chorioretinitis, retinoblastoma, retinitis pigmentosa), consideration must be given to many neurologic and systemic disorders that
can affect the visual pathways (see Table 661.1). Amaurosis of rather

rapid onset may indicate an encephalopathy (hypertension), infectious
or inflammatory (optic neuritis) processes, vasculitis, migraine, leukemia, drugs or toxins, eclampsia, or trauma. It may be caused by acute
demyelinating disease affecting the optic nerves, chiasm, or cerebrum.
In some cases, precipitous loss of vision is a result of increased intracranial pressure, rapidly progressive hydrocephalus, or dysfunction of
a ventricular shunt. More slowly progressive visual loss suggests tumor
or neurodegenerative disease. Gliomas of the optic nerve and chiasm
and craniopharyngiomas are primary diagnostic considerations in
children who show progressive loss of vision.
Clinical manifestations of impairment of vision vary with the age
and abilities of a child, the mode of onset, and the laterality and severity
of the deficit. The first clue to amaurosis in an infant may be nystagmus

or strabismus, with the vision deficit itself passing undetected for some
time. Timidity, clumsiness, or behavioral change may be the initial clues
in the very young. Deterioration in school progress and indifference to
school activities are common signs in an older child. School-­age children often try to hide their disability and, in the case of very slowly
progressive disorders, may not themselves realize the severity of the
problem; some detect and promptly report small changes in their vision.
Any evidence of loss of vision requires prompt and thorough ophthalmic evaluation. Complete delineation of childhood amaurosis and
its cause may require extensive investigation involving neurologic
evaluation, electrophysiologic tests, neuroradiologic procedures, and
sometimes metabolic and genetic studies. Furthermore, attendant special educational, social, and emotional needs must be met.

on the right side of the figure. Only then should the clinician
identify which muscle is weak, although this is unnecessary if
the clinician already suspects myasthenia (from fatigability) or
full third nerve palsy (from weakness of the medial rectus, superior rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique muscles, with
or without a dilated pupil). Uncommon causes of diplopia and
associated ptosis, not presented in the figure, are botulism,
the Fisher variant of Guillain-­Barre syndrome, and aberrant regeneration of the third nerve. Uncommon causes of diplopia
and associated orbital findings (e.g., proptosis) are carotid-­

NYCTALOPIA

Nyctalopia, or night blindness, is vision that is defective in reduced
illumination. It generally implies impairment in function of the rods,
particularly in dark adaptation time and perceptual threshold. Stationary congenital night blindness may occur as an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-­linked recessive condition. It may be
associated with myopia and nystagmus. Children may have excessive
problems going to sleep in a dark room, which may be mistaken for a
behavioral problem. Progressive night blindness usually indicates primary or secondary retinal, choroidal, or vitreoretinal degeneration (see
Chapter 670); it occurs also in vitamin A deficiency or as a result of
retinotoxic drugs such as quinine.

PSYCHOGENIC DISTURBANCES

Vision problems of psychogenic origin are common in school-­age children. Both conversion reactions and willful feigning are encountered. The
usual manifestation is a report of reduced visual acuity in one or both
eyes. Another common manifestation is constriction of the visual field. In
some cases, the symptom is diplopia or polyopia (see Chapters 35 and 38).
Important clues to the diagnosis are inappropriate affect, excessive
grimacing, inconsistency in performance, and suggestibility. A thorough ophthalmologic examination is essential to differentiate organic
from functional visual disorders.
Affected children usually fare well with reassurance and positive
suggestions. In some cases, mental health care is indicated. In all cases,
the approach must be supportive and nonpunitive.

DYSLEXIA

This is the inability to develop the capability to read at an expected level
despite an otherwise normal intellect (see Chapter 51). The terms reading disability and dyslexia are often used interchangeably. Most dyslexic individuals also display poor writing ability. Dyslexia is a primary
reading disorder and should be differentiated from secondary reading
difficulties caused by intellectual disability, environmental or educational deprivation, and systemic physical or other organic brain or eye
diseases. Because there is not one standard test for dyslexia, the diagnosis is usually made by comparing reading ability with intelligence and
standard reading expectations. Dyslexia is a language-­based disorder
and is not caused by any defect in the eye or visual acuity per se, nor
is it attributable to a defect in ocular motility or binocular alignment.
Although ophthalmologic evaluation of children with a reading problem is recommended to diagnose and correct any concurrent ocular
problems such as a refractive error, amblyopia, or strabismus, treatment directed to the eyes themselves cannot be expected to correct
developmental dyslexia (see Chapter 51).

of all patients, regardless of the means of transmission, and is found
in approximately 1/50,000 persons. Pathologic variants in PAX6 on
11p13 are typically implicated, and aniridia may be associated with
other ocular findings.
Aniridia is a panocular disorder and should not be thought of as an
isolated iris defect. Macular and optic nerve hypoplasia are commonly
present and lead to decreased vision and sensory nystagmus. The visual
acuity is approximately 20/200 in most patients, although the vision
may occasionally be better. Other ocular deformities are common and
may involve the lens and cornea. The cornea may be small, and a cellular infiltrate (pannus) occasionally develops in the superficial layers
of the peripheral cornea (keratopathy). Clinically this appears as a gray
opacification. Lens abnormalities include cataract formation and partial or total lens dislocation. Glaucoma develops in as many as 75% of
individuals with aniridia.
One-­fifth of sporadic aniridic patients may develop Wilms tumor
(see Chapter 548.1). Because of their proximity in location, large
deletions may include both PAX6 and WT1, leading to this association. Although it has traditionally been taught that only patients with
sporadic aniridia are at risk for developing Wilms tumor, it has also
been reported in individuals with familial aniridia. Additionally, genitourinary abnormalities and intellectual disability, when present with
aniridia, are strongly associated with Wilms tumor (WAGR syndrome).
Wilms tumor usually presents before the fifth year, and these children
should be screened using renal ultrasonography every 3-­6 months until
approximately 5 years of age if there is an 11p13 region deletion placing
the child at risk for Wilms tumor.

COLOBOMA OF THE IRIS

A coloboma is the defect formed when the embryonic fissure fails to
close completely. This unilateral or bilateral developmental defect may
present as a defect in a sector of the iris, a hole in the substance of the iris,
or a notch in the pupillary margin (Fig. 662.2). Simple (isolated) colobomas may be sporadic but are frequently transmitted as an autosomal
dominant trait and may occur alone or in association with other anomalies and syndromes (syndromic) (Table 662.1). Because of the anatomic
location of the embryonic fissure, an iris coloboma is always located inferiorly, giving the iris a keyhole appearance. An iris coloboma may be
the only externally visible part of a more extensive coloboma that also
involves the choroid, retina, and optic nerve. When this occurs, vision is
likely to be severely affected. Complications include retinal detachment,
cataract formation, and choroidal neovascularization. All children with
an iris coloboma should undergo a full ophthalmologic examination.

MICROCORIA

Microcoria (congenital miosis) appears as a small pupil that does not
react to light or accommodation and that dilates poorly, if at all, with
medication. The condition may be unilateral or bilateral. In bilateral
cases, the degree of miosis may be different in each eye. The eye may
be otherwise normal or may demonstrate other abnormalities of the

The term aniridia is a misnomer because some iris tissue is usually present, although it is hypoplastic (Fig. 662.1). Two-­thirds of
the cases are dominantly transmitted with a high degree of penetrance. The other third of cases are sporadic and are considered
new pathologic genetic variants. The condition is bilateral in 98%

anterior segment. Congenital microcoria is usually transmitted as an
autosomal dominant trait, although it may occur sporadically.

CONGENITAL MYDRIASIS

In this disorder, the pupils appear dilated, do not constrict significantly
to light or near gaze, and respond minimally to miotic agents. The iris
is otherwise normal, and affected children are usually healthy. Trauma,
pharmacologic mydriasis, and neurologic disorders should be considered. Congenital mydriasis is one component of the multisystemic
smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome; associated features include a
patent ductus arteriosus and dilation of the aorta. Many apparent cases
of congenital mydriasis show abnormalities of the central iris structures and may be considered a form of aniridia.

DYSCORIA AND CORECTOPIA

Dyscoria is abnormal shape of the pupil, and corectopia is abnormal
pupillary position. They may occur together or independently as congenital or acquired anomalies.
Congenital corectopia is usually bilateral and symmetric and rarely
occurs as an isolated anomaly; it is often accompanied by dislocation of
the lens (ectopia lentis et pupillae), and the lens and pupil are commonly
dislocated in opposite directions. Ectopia lentis et pupillae is transmitted as an autosomal recessive disorder; consanguinity is common. It

is associated with pathologic variants in ADAMTSL4, which encodes a
secreted glycoprotein widely distributed in the eye, which binds fibrillin-­1 microfibrils and accelerates microfibril biogenesis.
When acquired, distortion and displacement of the pupil are frequently a result of trauma or intraocular inflammation. Prolapse of the
iris after perforating injuries of the eye leads to peaking of the pupil in
the direction of the perforation. Posterior synechiae (adhesions of the
iris to the lens) are commonly seen when inflammation from any cause
occurs in the anterior segment.

ANISOCORIA

Anisocoria occurs when the pupils are of different sizes. This may be
a result of local or neurologic disorders. As a rule, if the inequality is
more pronounced in the presence of bright focal illumination or on near
gaze, there is a defect in pupillary constriction and the larger pupil is
abnormal. If the anisocoria is worse in reduced illumination, a defect
in dilation exists and the smaller pupil is abnormal (Figs. 662.3 and
662.4). Neurologic causes of anisocoria (parasympathetic or sympathetic lesions) must be differentiated from local causes such as synechiae (adhesions), congenital iris defects (colobomas, aniridia), and
pharmacologic effects. Horner syndrome is an important cause of
anisocoria (see later). Simple central anisocoria may occur in otherwise healthy individuals.

DILATED FIXED PUPIL

A dilated, unreactive pupil may be caused by internal ophthalmoplegia,
Hutchinson pupil of transtentorial herniation, tonic pupil, pharmacologic
blockade, and iridoplegia secondary to ocular trauma (see Fig. 662.3).
The most common cause of a dilated unreactive pupil is purposeful
or accidental instillation of a cycloplegic agent, particularly atropine
and related substances. Central nervous system lesions, such as a pinealoma, may cause internal ophthalmoplegia in children. Because the
external surface of the oculomotor nerve carries the fibers responsible
for pupillary constriction, compression of the nerve along its intracranial course may be associated with internal ophthalmoplegia, even
before the development of ptosis or an ocular motility deficit. Although
ophthalmoplegic migraine is a common cause of a third nerve palsy
with pupillary involvement in children, an intracranial aneurysm must
also be considered in the differential diagnosis. The blown pupil of
transtentorial herniation, occurring with increasing intracranial pressure, is generally unilateral, and patients usually are obviously ill. The
pilocarpine test can help differentiate neurologic iridoplegia from
pharmacologic blockade. In the case of neurologic iridoplegia, the
dilated pupil constricts within minutes after instillation of 1 or 2 drops
of 0.5–1% pilocarpine; if the pupil has been dilated with atropine, pilocarpine has no effect. Because pilocarpine is a long-­acting drug, this
test is not to be used in acute situations in which pupillary signs must
be carefully monitored. Because of the consensual pupil response to
light, even complete uniocular blindness does not cause a unilaterally
dilated pupil.

TONIC PUPIL

This is typically a large pupil that reacts poorly to light (the reaction may be very slow or even absent), reacts poorly and slowly to
accommodation, and redilates in a slow, tonic manner. The features of tonic pupil are explained by cholinergic supersensitivity
of the sphincter after peripheral (postganglionic) denervation and
imperfect reinnervation. A distinctive feature of a tonic pupil is its
sensitivity to dilute cholinergic agents. Instillation of 0.125% pilocarpine causes significant constriction of the involved pupil and
has little or no effect on the unaffected side. The condition is usually unilateral.
Tonic pupil may develop after the acute stage of a partial or complete iridoplegia. It can be seen after trauma to the eye or orbit and may
occur in association with toxic or infectious conditions. For those in
the pediatric age group, tonic pupil is uncommon. Infectious processes
(primarily viral syndromes) and trauma are the primary causes. Features of tonic pupil may also be seen in infants and children with familial dysautonomia (Riley-­Day syndrome), although the significance of
these findings has been questioned. Tonic pupil has also been reported
in young children with Charcot-­Marie-­Tooth disease. Tonic pupil and
other pupillary abnormalities may be noted in ROHHAD syndrome
(rapid onset obesity, hypoventilation, hypothalamic dysfunction, and

Fig. 662.3 Approach to anisocoria. The first two
questions (Is there normal light reaction? And is anisocoria worse in darkness or light?) distinguish problems with the pupillary dilator muscle (i.e., Horner
syndrome, simple anisocoria; left side of figure) from
problems with the pupillary constrictor muscle (i.e.,
third cranial nerve, iris; right side of figure). Two
other tests distinguish Horner syndrome from simple anisocoria: the cocaine test and pupillary dilator lag (i.e., the pupil dilates slowly in darkness, as
documented in photographs). (From Czarnecki JSC,

autonomic dysregulation). The occurrence of tonic pupil in association
with decreased deep tendon reflexes in young women is referred to as
Adie syndrome.
Ross syndrome is similar to Adie syndrome and includes decreased
deep tendon reflexes and hypohidrosis.

MARCUS GUNN PUPIL

A relative afferent pupillary defect (Marcus Gunn pupil) indicates an
asymmetric, prechiasmatic, afferent conduction defect. It is best demonstrated by the swinging flashlight test, which allows comparison of
the direct and consensual pupillary responses in both eyes (Fig. 662.5).
With patients fixing on a distant target (to control accommodation),
a bright focal light is directed alternately into each eye in turn. In the
presence of an afferent lesion, both the direct response to light in the
affected eye and the consensual response in the other eye are subnormal. Swinging the light to the better or normal eye causes both pupils
to react (constrict) normally. Swinging the light back to the affected eye
causes both pupils to redilate to some degree, reflecting the defective
conduction. This is a very sensitive and useful test for detecting and
confirming optic nerve and retinal disease. This test is only abnormal if
there is a “relative” difference in the conduction properties of the optic
nerves. Therefore patients with bilateral and symmetric optic nerve

pupils will react to light, whereas the larger pupil of patient 1 does not
react well to light. (From McGee S. Evidence-­Based Physical Diagnosis.

disease will not demonstrate an afferent pupillary defect. A subtle relative afferent defect may be found in some children with amblyopia.

HORNER SYNDROME

The principal signs of oculosympathetic paresis (Horner syndrome)
are homolateral miosis, mild ptosis, and apparent enophthalmos with
slight elevation of the lower lid as a result of the ptosis. Patients may
also have decreased facial sweating, increased amplitude of accommodation, and transient decrease in intraocular pressure. If paralysis
of the ocular sympathetic fibers occurs before the age of 2 years, heterochromia iridis with hypopigmentation of the iris may occur on the
affected side (Fig. 662.6).
Oculosympathetic paralysis may be caused by a lesion (tumor,
trauma, infarction) in the midbrain, brainstem, upper spinal cord,
neck, middle fossa, or orbit (Table 662.2). Congenital oculosympathetic paresis, often as part of Klumpke brachial palsy, is common,
although the ocular signs, particularly the anisocoria, may pass undetected for years. Horner syndrome is also seen in some children after
thoracic surgery. Congenital Horner syndrome may occur in association with vertebral anomalies and with enterogenous cysts. In some
infants and children, Horner syndrome is the presenting sign of tumor
in the mediastinal or cervical region—specifically neuroblastoma. Rare
causes of Horner syndrome, such as vascular lesions or ectopic thymus
tissue, also occur in the pediatric age group. In many cases, no cause of
congenital Horner syndrome can be identified. Occasionally the condition is familial.
When the cause of Horner syndrome is in question, investigative
procedures should be implemented and may include imaging of the
head, neck, and chest, as well as 24-­hour urinary catecholamine assay.
Examining old photographs and old records can sometimes be helpful
in establishing the age at onset of Horner syndrome.
The cocaine test is useful in diagnosing oculosympathetic paralysis;
a normal pupil dilates within 20-­45 minutes after instillation of one or
two drops of 4% cocaine, whereas the miotic pupil of an oculosympathetic paresis dilates poorly, if at all, with cocaine. In some cases,
there is also denervation supersensitivity of the affected eye to dilute

Fig. 662.5 The relative afferent pupillary defect (Marcus Gunn pupil).
The figure depicts a patient with an abnormal right optic nerve. Under
normal room light illumination (row 1), the pupils are symmetrical. During
the swinging flashlight test, the pupils constrict when the normal eye is
illuminated (rows 2 and 4) but dilate when the abnormal eye is illuminated
(rows 3 and 5). Although both pupils constrict or dilate simultaneously, the
clinician is usually focused on just the illuminated pupil. The pupil that dilates during the swinging flashlight test has the “relative afferent pupillary
defect” and is labeled the Marcus Gunn pupil. (From McGee S. Evidence-­
Based Physical Diagnosis. 3rd ed. Elsevier; 2012; Fig. 20.2, p. 165.)

to a “reversal” of the apparent miosis. Furthermore, instillation of 1%
hydroxyamphetamine hydrobromide can help determine the location
of sympathetic lesion because it only dilates the pupil if the postganglionic sympathetic neuron is intact.

PARADOXICAL PUPIL REACTION

Some children exhibit paradoxical constriction of the pupils to darkness. An initial brisk constriction of the pupils occurs when the light
is turned off, followed by slow redilation of the pupils. The response
to direct light stimulation and the near response are normal. The
mechanism is not clear, but paradoxical constriction of the pupils in
reduced light can be a sign of retinal or optic nerve abnormalities. The
phenomenon has been observed in children with congenital stationary night blindness, albinism, retinitis pigmentosa, Leber congenital
retinal amaurosis, and Best disease. It has also been observed in those
with optic nerve anomalies, optic neuritis, optic atrophy, and possibly
amblyopia. Thus children with paradoxical pupillary constriction to
darkness should have a thorough ophthalmologic examination.

PERSISTENT PUPILLARY MEMBRANE

Involution of the pupillary membrane and anterior vascular capsule
of the lens is usually completed during months 5-­6 of fetal development. It is common to see some remnants of the pupillary membrane
in newborns, particularly in premature infants. These membranes are
nonpigmented strands of obliterated vessels that cross the pupil and
may secondarily attach to the lens or cornea. The remnants tend to
atrophy in time and usually present no problem. In some cases, however, significant remnants that remain obscure the pupil and interfere
with vision. In rare cases, there is patency of the vascular elements;
hyphema may result from rupture of persistent vessels.
Intervention must be considered to minimize amblyopia in infants
with extensive persistent pupillary membrane of sufficient degree to
interfere with vision in the early months of life. In some cases, mydriatics and occlusion therapy may be effective, but in others, surgery may
be needed to provide an adequate pupillary aperture.

HETEROCHROMIA

In heterochromia, the two irises are of different color (heterochromia
iridium) or a portion of an iris differs in color from the remainder (heterochromia iridis). Simple heterochromia may occur as an autosomal
dominant characteristic. Congenital heterochromia is also a feature of
Waardenburg syndrome, an autosomal dominant condition characterized principally by lateral displacement of the inner canthi and puncta,

pigmentary disturbances (usually a median white forelock and patches
of hypopigmentation of the skin), and defective hearing. Change in the
color of the iris may occur as a result of trauma, hemorrhage, intraocular inflammation (iridocyclitis, uveitis), intraocular tumor (especially
retinoblastoma), intraocular foreign body, glaucoma, iris atrophy, or
oculosympathetic palsy (Horner syndrome), which may be associated
with a cervical neuroblastoma, melanosis oculi, previous intraocular
surgery, and some glaucoma medications.

OTHER IRIS LESIONS

Discrete nodules of the iris, referred to as Lisch nodules, are commonly seen in patients with neurofibromatosis (see Chapter 636.1).
Lisch nodules represent melanocytic hamartomas of the iris and vary
from slightly elevated pigmented areas to distinct ball-­like excrescences. The nodules cause no visual disturbance. Lisch nodules are
found in 92–100% of individuals older than 5 years of age who have
neurofibromatosis but are rare in infancy. Slit-­lamp identification of
these nodules may help fulfill the criteria required to confirm the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis.
In leukemia (see Chapter 544), there may be infiltration of the iris,
sometimes with hypopyon, an accumulation of white blood cells in
the anterior chamber, which may herald relapse or involvement of the
central nervous system.
The lesion of juvenile xanthogranuloma (nevoxanthoendothelioma; see Chapter 711) may occur in the eye as a yellowish fleshy mass
or plaque of the iris. Spontaneous hyphema (blood in the anterior
chamber), glaucoma, or a red eye with signs of uveitis may be associated. A search for the skin lesions of xanthogranuloma should be made
in any infant or young child with spontaneous hyphema, although the
iris lesions may be present without cutaneous manifestations. In many
cases, the ocular lesion responds to topical corticosteroid therapy.

LEUKOCORIA

This includes any white pupillary reflex, or so-­called cat’s-­eye reflex. Primary diagnostic considerations in any child with leukocoria are cataract, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous, cicatricial retinopathy of
prematurity, retinal detachment, retinoschisis, larval granulomatosis,
and retinoblastoma (Fig. 662.7). Also to be considered are endophthalmitis, organized vitreous hemorrhage, leukemic ophthalmopathy,
exudative retinopathy (as in Coats disease), and less-­common conditions such as medulloepithelioma, massive retinal gliosis, the retinal pseudotumor of Norrie disease, the so-­called pseudoglioma of the
Bloch-­Sulzberger syndrome, retinal dysplasia, and the retinal lesions of
the phakomatoses. A white reflex may also be seen with fundus coloboma, large atrophic chorioretinal scars, and ectopic medullation of
retinal nerve fibers. Leukocoria is an indication for prompt and thorough
evaluation.
The diagnosis can often be made by direct examination of the eye by
ophthalmoscopy and biomicroscopy. Ultrasonographic and radiologic
examinations are often helpful. In some cases, the final diagnosis rests
with a pathologist.

Disorders of Eye
Movement and Alignment
Scott E. Olitsky and Justin D. Marsh
STRABISMUS

Strabismus, or misalignment of the eyes, is one of the most common
eye problems encountered in children, affecting approximately 4% of
children younger than 6 years of age. Strabismus can result in vision
loss (amblyopia) and can have significant psychologic effects. Early
detection and treatment of strabismus are essential to prevent permanent visual impairment. Of children with strabismus, 30–50% develop
amblyopia. Restoration of proper alignment of the visual axis must
occur at an early stage of visual development to allow these children
a chance to develop normal binocular vision. The word strabismus
means “to squint or to look obliquely.” Many terms are used in discussing and characterizing strabismus (Table 663.1).
Orthophoria is the ideal condition of exact ocular balance. It implies
that the oculomotor apparatus is in perfect equilibrium so that the eyes
remain coordinated and aligned in all positions of gaze and at all distances. Even when binocular vision is interrupted, as by occlusion of
one eye, truly orthophoric individuals maintain perfect alignment.
Orthophoria is seldom encountered because the majority of individuals have a small latent deviation (heterophoria).
Heterophoria is a latent tendency for the eyes to deviate. This
latent deviation is normally controlled by fusional mechanisms that
provide binocular vision or avoid diplopia (double vision). The eye
deviates only under certain conditions, such as fatigue, illness, or
stress, or during tests that interfere with maintenance of these normal fusional abilities (such as covering one eye). If the amount of
heterophoria is large, it may give rise to bothersome symptoms, such
as transient diplopia (double vision), headaches, or asthenopia (eyestrain). Some degree of heterophoria is found in normal individuals;
it is usually asymptomatic.
Heterotropia is a misalignment of the eyes that is constant. It occurs
because of an inability of the fusional mechanism to control the deviation. Tropias may be unilateral or may alternate between either eye,
depending on the patient. In an alternating tropia, there is no preference for fixation of either eye, and both eyes drift with equal frequency.
Because each eye is used periodically, vision usually develops normally.
A unilateral tropia is a more serious situation because only one eye is
constantly misaligned. The undeviated eye becomes the preferred eye,
resulting in loss of vision or amblyopia of the deviated eye.
It is common in ocular misalignments to describe the type of deviation. This helps to make decisions on the cause and treatment of the
strabismus. The prefixes eso-­, exo-­, hyper-­, and hypo-­ are added to the
terms phoria and tropia to further delineate the type of strabismus.
Esophorias and esotropias are inward or convergent deviations of the
eyes, commonly known as crossed eyes. Exophorias and exotropias are
divergent or outward-­facing eye deviations, walleyed being the lay term.
Hyperdeviations and hypodeviations designate upward or downward,
respectively, deviations of an eye. In cases of unilateral strabismus, the
deviating eye is often part of the description of the misalignment (left
esotropia).

Diagnosis

Many techniques are used to assess ocular alignment and movement
of the eyes to aid in diagnosing strabismic disorders. In a child with
strabismus or any other ocular disorder, assessment of visual acuity is
mandatory. Decreased vision in one eye requires evaluation for a strabismus or other ocular abnormalities, which may be difficult to discern
on a brief screening evaluation. Even strabismic deviations of only a

3925

few degrees in magnitude, too small to be evident by gross inspection,
may lead to amblyopia and significant vision loss.
Corneal light reflex tests are perhaps the most rapid and easily performed diagnostic tests for strabismus. They are particularly useful in
children who are uncooperative and in those who have poor ocular
fixation. To perform the Hirschberg corneal reflex test, the examiner
projects a light source onto the cornea of both eyes simultaneously as
a child looks directly at the light. Comparison should then be made of
the placement of the corneal light reflex in each eye. In straight eyes,
the light reflection appears symmetric and, because of the relationship
between the cornea and the macula, slightly nasal to the center of each
pupil. If strabismus is present, the reflected light is asymmetric and
appears displaced in one eye. The Krimsky method of the corneal reflex
test uses prisms placed over one or both eyes to align the light reflections. The amount of prism needed to align the reflections is used to
measure the degree of deviation. Although it is a useful screening test,
corneal light reflex testing may not detect a small angle or an intermittent strabismus.
Cover tests for strabismus require a child’s attention and cooperation, good eye movement capability, and reasonably good vision in
each eye (Fig. 663.1). If any of these are lacking, the results of these
tests may not be valid. These tests consist of the cover-­uncover test and
the alternate cover test. In the cover-­uncover test, a child looks at an
object in the distance, preferably 6 m away. An eye chart is commonly
used for fixation in children older than 3 years of age. For younger
children, a noise-­making toy or movie helps hold their attention for
the test. As the child looks at the distant object, the examiner covers
one eye and watches for movement of the uncovered eye. If no movement occurs, there is no apparent misalignment of that eye. After one
eye is tested, the same procedure is repeated on the other eye. When
performing the alternate cover test, the examiner rapidly covers and
uncovers each eye, shifting back and forth from one eye to the other. If
the child has an ocular deviation, the eye rapidly moves as the cover is
shifted to the other eye. Both the cover-­uncover test and the alternate
cover test should be performed at both distance and near fixation. The
cover-­uncover test differentiates tropias, or manifest deviations, from
latent deviations, called phorias.

Clinical Manifestations and Treatment

The etiologic classification of strabismus is complex, and the causative
types must be distinguished; there are comitant and noncomitant
forms of strabismus.

Comitant Strabismus

Comitant strabismus is the most common type of strabismus. The
individual extraocular muscles usually have no defect, and extraocular
motility is full in all positions of gaze. The amount of deviation is constant, or relatively constant, in the various directions of gaze.
Pseudostrabismus is one of the most common reasons a pediatric ophthalmologist is asked to evaluate an infant. This condition is
characterized by the false appearance of strabismus when the visual
axes are aligned accurately. This appearance may be caused by a
flat, broad nasal bridge, prominent epicanthal folds, or a narrow
interpupillary distance, giving the appearance of esotropia despite
the eyes being aligned (pseudoesotropia). The observer may see less
white sclera nasally than would be expected, and the impression is
that the eye is turned in toward the nose, especially when the child
gazes to either side. Parents frequently comment that when their
child looks to the side, the eye almost disappears from view. Pseudoesotropia can be differentiated from a true misalignment of the
eyes when the corneal light reflex is centered in both eyes and when
the cover-­uncover test shows no refixation movement. Once pseudoesotropia has been confirmed, parents can be reassured that the
child will outgrow the appearance of esotropia. As the child grows,
the bridge of the nose becomes more prominent and displaces the
epicanthal folds, and the medial sclera becomes proportional to the
amount visible on the lateral aspect. It is the appearance of crossing
that the child will outgrow. Because true esotropia can develop later
in children with pseudoesotropia, parents and pediatricians should

be cautioned that reassessment is required if the apparent deviation
does not improve.
Esodeviations are the most common type of ocular misalignment
in children and represent >50% of all ocular deviations. Congenital esotropia is a confusing term. Few children who are diagnosed with this
disorder are actually born with an esotropia. For this reason, infants
with confirmed onset earlier than 6 months are typically considered to
have what was previously classified as congenital esotropia, although
the term infantile esotropia is perhaps a more accurate description.
Between 2-­4 months of age, many infants will exhibit strabismus,
including esotropia, which typically resolve spontaneously. Esotropia
that resolves without treatment do so before 10-­12 weeks of age and
have intermittent or variable deviations. Those most likely to benefit
from active treatment have persistent esotropia (10 weeks-­6 months of

age) and constant esotropia (40 PD), in combination with a refractive
error ≤ +3.00 D, and the absence of prematurity, developmental delay,
meningitis, nystagmus, eye anomalies, and incomitant or paralytic
strabismus. The evaluation is noted in Figure 663.2.
The characteristic angle of infantile esodeviations is large and constant (Fig. 663.3). Because of the large deviation, cross-­fixation is
frequently encountered. This is a condition in which the child looks
to the right with the left eye and to the left with the right eye. With
cross-­fixation, there is no need for the eye to turn away from the nose
(abduction) as the adducting eye is used in side gaze; this condition
simulates a sixth nerve palsy. Abduction can be demonstrated by the
doll’s-­head maneuver or by patching one eye for a short time. Children with infantile esotropia tend to have refractive errors similar
to those of normal children of the same age. This contrasts with the
characteristic high level of farsightedness associated with accommodative esotropia. Amblyopia is common in children with infantile
esotropia.
The primary goal of treatment in infantile esotropia is to eliminate
or reduce the deviation as much as possible. Ideally this results in normal sight in each eye, in straight-­looking eyes, and in the development
of binocular vision. Early treatment (before age 2 years) is more likely
to lead to the development of binocular vision, which helps maintain
long-­term ocular alignment. Once any associated amblyopia is treated,
surgery is performed to align the eyes. Even with successful surgical
alignment, it is common for vertical deviations to develop in children
with a history of infantile esotropia. The two most common forms of
vertical deviations to develop are inferior oblique muscle overaction
and dissociated vertical deviation. In inferior oblique muscle overaction, the overactive inferior oblique muscle produces an upshoot of the
eye closest to the nose when the patient looks to the side (Fig. 663.4). In
dissociated vertical deviation, one eye drifts up slowly with no movement of the other eye. Surgery may be necessary to treat either or both
of these conditions.
It is important that parents realize that early successful surgical
alignment is only the beginning of the treatment process. Because
many children may redevelop strabismus or amblyopia, they need to
be monitored closely during the visually immature period of life.
Accommodative esotropia is defined as a “convergent deviation
of the eyes associated with activation of the accommodative (focusing) reflex.” It usually occurs in a child who is between 2-­3 years of age
and who has a history of acquired intermittent or constant crossing.
Amblyopia occurs in the majority of cases.
The mechanism of accommodative esotropia involves uncorrected
hyperopia, accommodation, and accommodative convergence. The
image entering a hyperopic (farsighted) eye is blurred. If the amount
of hyperopia is not significant, the blurred image can be sharpened by
accommodating (focusing of the lens of the eye). Accommodation is
closely linked with convergence (eyes turning inward) because both are
required to view an object at near. If a child’s hyperopic refractive error

Chapter 663 u Disorders of Eye Movement and Alignment
is large or if the amount of convergence that occurs in response to each
unit of accommodative effort is great, esotropia may develop.
The treatment for accommodative esotropia is to prescribe the full
hyperopic (farsighted) correction. These glasses eliminate a child’s
need to accommodate and therefore correct the esotropia (Fig. 663.5).
Although many parents are initially concerned that their child will not
want to wear glasses, the benefits of binocular vision and the decrease
in the focusing effort required to see clearly provide a strong stimulus
to wear glasses, and they are generally accepted well. The full hyperopic
correction sometimes straightens the eye position at distance fixation
but leaves a residual deviation at near fixation. This may be observed,
treated with bifocal lenses, or treated with surgery.
It is important to warn parents of children with accommodative
esotropia that the esodeviation may appear to increase without glasses
after the initial correction is worn. Parents frequently state that before
wearing glasses, their child had a small esodeviation, whereas after
removal of the glasses, the esodeviation becomes quite large. Parents
often blame the increased esodeviation on the glasses. This apparent
increase is a result of the child using the appropriate amount of accommodative effort after the glasses have been worn. When these children
remove their glasses, they continue to use an accommodative effort to
bring objects into proper focus and increase the esodeviation.
Most children maintain straight eyes once initially treated. Because
hyperopia generally decreases with age, patients may outgrow the need
to wear glasses to maintain alignment. In some patients, a residual
esodeviation persists even when wearing their glasses. This condition
commonly occurs when there is a delay between the onset of accommodative esotropia and treatment. In others, the esotropia may initially be eliminated with glasses, but crossing redevelops and is not
correctable with glasses. Any residual component of esotropia that is
not fully correctable with glasses is typically referred to as “nonaccommodative,” and a child with both accommodative and nonaccommodative components of esotropia is often referred to as having “partially

3927

accommodative” esotropia. Surgery for the nonaccommodative portion of the crossing may be indicated to restore binocular vision.
Exodeviations are the second most common type of misalignment.
The divergent deviation may be intermittent or constant. Intermittent
exotropia is the most common exodeviation in childhood. It is characterized by outward drifting of one eye, which usually occurs when
a child is fixating at distance. The deviation is generally more frequent
with fatigue or illness. Exposure to bright light may cause reflex closure
of the exotropic eye. Because the eyes initially can be kept straight most
of the time, visual acuity tends to be good in both eyes and binocular
vision is initially normal.
The age at onset of intermittent exotropia varies but is often between
age 6 months and 4 years. The decision to perform eye muscle surgery
is based on the amount and frequency of the deviation. If the deviation is small and infrequent, it is reasonable to observe the child. If the
exotropia is large or increasing in frequency, surgery is indicated to
maintain normal binocular vision.
Constant exotropia may rarely be congenital. Congenital exotropia
may be associated with neurologic disease or abnormalities of the bony
orbit, as in Crouzon syndrome. Exotropia that occurs later in life may
represent a deterioration of an intermittent exotropia that was present in childhood. Surgery can restore binocular vision even in long-­
standing cases.

Noncomitant Strabismus

When an eye muscle is paretic, palsied, or restricted, a muscle imbalance occurs in which the deviation of the eye varies according to the
direction of gaze. Recent onset of a paretic muscle can be suggested
by the symptom of double vision that increases in one direction, the
findings of an ocular deviation that increases in the field of action of
the paretic muscle, and an increase in the deviation when the child
fixates with the paretic eye. It is important to differentiate a noncomitant strabismus from a comitant deviation because noncomitant forms

the internal branch of the third nerve is involved, pupillary dilation
may be noted as well. Eye movements are usually limited nasally, in elevation, and in depression. In addition, clinical findings and treatment
may be complicated in congenital and traumatic cases of third nerve
palsy, owing to misdirection of regenerating nerve fibers, referred to as
aberrant regeneration. This results in anomalous and paradoxical eyelid, eye, and pupil movement such as elevation of the eyelid, constriction of the pupil, or depression of the globe on attempted medial gaze.

of strabismus are often associated with trauma, systemic disorders, or
neurologic abnormalities (Table 663.2).

Third Nerve Palsy

In the pediatric population, third nerve palsies are usually congenital.
The congenital form is often associated with a developmental anomaly or birth trauma. Acquired third nerve palsies in children can be
an ominous sign and may indicate a neurologic abnormality such as
increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and an intracranial neoplasm or
aneurysm. Other, less serious causes include an inflammatory or infectious lesion, head trauma, postviral syndromes, and migraines.
A third nerve palsy, whether congenital or acquired, usually results
in an exotropia and a hypotropia, or downward deviation of the affected
eye, as well as complete or partial ptosis of the upper lid. This characteristic strabismus results from the action of the normal, unopposed
muscles, the lateral rectus muscle, and the superior oblique muscle. If

These palsies can be congenital or acquired. Because the fourth nerve
has a long intracranial course, it is susceptible to damage resulting
from head trauma. In children, however, fourth nerve palsies are more
frequently congenital than traumatic. A palsied fourth nerve results
in weakness in the superior oblique muscle, which causes an upward
deviation of the affected eye, a hypertropia. Because the antagonist
muscle, the inferior oblique, is relatively unopposed, the affected eye
demonstrates an upshoot when looking toward the nose. Children
typically present with a head tilt to the shoulder opposite the affected
eye and may also position their chin down and face turned away from
the affected side. This head position places the eye away from the area
of greatest action of the affected muscle and therefore minimizes the
deviation and the associated double vision. Because the abnormal head
posture maintains the child’s ocular alignment, amblyopia is uncommon. Because no abnormality exists in the neck muscles, attempts to
correct the head tilt by exercises and neck muscle surgery are ineffective. Recognition of a superior oblique paresis can be difficult because
deviation of the head and the eye may be minimal. Treatment may
include eye muscle surgery to improve the ocular alignment and eliminate the abnormal head posture.

Sixth Nerve Palsy

These palsies produce markedly crossed eyes with limited ability to
move the afflicted eye laterally. Children frequently present with their
head turned toward the palsied muscle, a position that helps preserve
binocular vision. The esotropia is largest when the eye is moved toward
the affected muscle.
Congenital sixth nerve palsies are rare. Decreased lateral gaze in
infants is often associated with other disorders, such as infantile esotropia or Duane retraction syndrome. In neonates, a transient sixth
nerve paresis can occur; it usually clears spontaneously by 6 weeks. It

is believed that increased ICP associated with labor and delivery is the

Acquired sixth nerve palsies in childhood are often an ominous sign
because the sixth nerve is susceptible to increased ICP associated with
hydrocephalous and intracranial tumors. Other causes of sixth nerve
defects in children include trauma, vascular malformations, meningitis, and Gradenigo syndrome. A benign sixth nerve palsy, which is
painless and acquired, can be noted in infants and older children. This
is frequently preceded by a febrile illness or upper respiratory tract
infection and may be recurrent. Complete resolution of the palsy is
common in this scenario, although other causes of an acute sixth nerve
palsy should be eliminated before this diagnosis is made.

Strabismus Syndromes

Special types of strabismus have unusual clinical features. Most of these
disorders are caused by structural anomalies of the extraocular muscles
or adjacent tissues. Most strabismus syndromes produce noncomitant
misalignments.

Monocular Elevation Deficiency

A monocular elevation deficit in both abduction and adduction
is referred to as monocular elevation deficiency (previously called
double-­elevator palsy). It may represent a paresis of both elevators, the
superior rectus and inferior oblique muscles, or a possible restriction
to elevation from a fibrotic inferior rectus muscle. When an affected
child fixates with the nonparetic eye, the paretic eye is hypotropic
and the ipsilateral upper eyelid may appear ptotic. Fixation with the
paretic eye causes a hypertropia of the nonparetic eye and a disappearance of the ptosis (Fig. 663.6). Because the apparent ptosis is
actually secondary to the strabismus, correction of the hypotropia
treats the pseudoptosis.

Fig. 663.6 Double-­elevator palsy of the right eye. Note the disappearance of the apparent ptosis when fixating with the involved eye.

Duane Syndrome

This congenital disorder of ocular motility is characterized by retraction of the globe on adduction. Duane syndrome occurs more frequently in females and involves the left eye more commonly than the
right eye. It is caused by the absence of the sixth nerve nucleus and
subsequent anomalous innervation of the lateral rectus muscle, which
results in co-­contraction of the medial and lateral rectus muscles on
attempted adduction of the affected eye. Within the spectrum of Duane
syndrome, patients may exhibit impairment of abduction, impairment

of adduction, or upshoot or downshoot of the involved eye on adduction. They may have esotropia, exotropia, or relatively straight eyes.
Many children exhibit a compensatory head posture to maintain single
vision. Some develop amblyopia. Surgery to improve alignment or to
reduce a noticeable face turn can be helpful in selected cases. Duane
syndrome usually occurs sporadically, but it can be inherited as an
autosomal dominant trait. While typically occurring as an isolated
condition, some patients may have various associated ocular and systemic anomalies.

Möbius Syndrome

The distinctive features of Möbius syndrome are congenital facial paresis and abduction weakness. The facial palsy is commonly bilateral, frequently asymmetric, and often incomplete, tending to spare the lower
face and platysma. Ectropion, epiphora, and exposure keratopathy may
develop. The abduction defect may be unilateral or bilateral. Esotropia is common. The cause is unknown. Whether the primary defect
is maldevelopment of cranial nerve nuclei, hypoplasia of the muscles,
or a combination of central and peripheral factors is unclear. Some
familial cases have been reported. Associated developmental defects
may include ptosis, palatal and lingual palsy, hearing loss, pectoral and
lingual muscle defects, micrognathia, syndactyly, supernumerary digits, and the absence of hands, feet, fingers, or toes. Surgical correction
of the esotropia is indicated and any attendant amblyopia should be
treated.

Brown Syndrome

In this syndrome, elevation of the eye in the adducted position is
restricted (Fig. 663.7). An associated downward deviation of the
affected eye in adduction may also occur. A compensatory head posture may be evident. Brown syndrome occurs as a result of restriction
of the superior oblique tendon as it moves through the trochlea. Cases
may be congenital or acquired. Acquired Brown syndrome may follow trauma to the orbit involving the region of the trochlea or sinus
surgery. It may also occur with inflammatory processes, particularly
sinusitis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
Acquired inflammatory Brown syndrome may respond to treatment
with either nonsteroidal medications or corticosteroids. Surgery may
be helpful for selected cases of Brown syndrome.

Parinaud Syndrome

This eponym designates a palsy of vertical gaze, isolated or associated
with pupillary or nuclear oculomotor (third cranial nerve) paresis. It
indicates a lesion affecting the mesencephalic tegmentum. The ophthalmic signs of midbrain disease include vertical gaze palsy, dissociation of the pupillary responses to light and to near focus, general
pupillomotor paralysis, corectopia, dyscoria, accommodative disturbances, pathologic lid retraction, ptosis, extraocular muscle paresis,
and convergence paralysis. Some cases have associated spasms of convergence, convergent retraction nystagmus, and vertical nystagmus,
particularly on attempted vertical gaze. Combinations of these signs
are referred to as the sylvian aqueduct syndrome.
A principal cause of vertical gaze palsy and associated mesencephalic signs in children is tumor of the pineal gland or third
ventricle. Differential diagnosis includes trauma and demyelinating disease. In children with hydrocephalus, impairment of vertical
gaze and pathologic lid retraction are referred to as the setting-­sun
sign. A transient supranuclear disorder of gaze is sometimes seen in
healthy neonates.

CONGENITAL OCULAR MOTOR APRAXIA

This congenital disorder of conjugate gaze is characterized by a
defect in voluntary horizontal gaze, compensatory jerking movement
of the head, and retention of slow pursuit and reflexive eye movements. Additional features are absence of the fast (refixation) phase
of optokinetic nystagmus and obligate contraversive deviation of the
eyes on rotation of the body. Affected children typically are unable to
look quickly to either side voluntarily in response to a command or
in response to an eccentrically presented object but may be able to

Fig. 663.7 Brown syndrome of the right eye.
follow a slowly moving target to either side. To compensate for the
defect in purposive lateral eye movements, children jerk their head
to bring the eyes into the desired position and may also blink repetitively in an attempt to change fixation. The signs tend to become less
conspicuous with age.
The pathogenesis of congenital ocular motor apraxia is unknown.
It may be a result of delayed myelination of the ocular motor pathways. Structural abnormalities of the central nervous system (CNS)
have been found in a few patients, including agenesis of the corpus
callosum and cerebellar vermis, porencephaly, hamartoma of the
foramen of Monro, and macrocephaly. Many children with congenital ocular motor apraxia show delayed motor and cognitive
development.

NYSTAGMUS

Nystagmus (rhythmic oscillations of one or both eyes) may be caused
by an abnormality in any one of the three basic mechanisms that regulate position and movement of the eyes: the fixation, conjugate gaze,
or vestibular mechanism. In addition, physiologic nystagmus may be
elicited by appropriate stimuli (Table 663.3).
Congenital sensory nystagmus is generally associated with ocular abnormalities that lead to decreased visual acuity; common disorders that lead to early-­onset nystagmus include albinism, aniridia,
achromatopsia, congenital cataracts, congenital macular lesions, congenital optic atrophy, and congenital optic nerve hypoplasia. In some
instances, nystagmus occurs as a dominant or X-­linked characteristic
without obvious ocular abnormalities.
Congenital idiopathic motor nystagmus is characterized by horizontal jerky oscillations, often with gaze preponderance. There are no
ocular anatomic defects that cause the nystagmus, and the visual acuity
is generally near normal. There may be a null point in which the nystagmus damps and the vision improves; a compensatory head posture
will develop that places the eyes into the position of least nystagmus.
The cause of congenital idiopathic motor nystagmus is unknown; in
some instances, this is familial. Eye muscle surgery may be performed
to eliminate an abnormal head posture by bringing the point of best
vision into straight-­ahead gaze.
Acquired nystagmus requires prompt and thorough evaluation.
Spontaneous nystagmus is often associated with either peripheral
or central vestibular disorders. Peripheral disorders are often acute
and benign, but the severity of symptoms is often problematic to
the patient (room spinning, unsteady gait, tinnitus, diaphoresis).
Central vestibular lesions are more concerning for CNS disorders
(vestibular nuclei, brainstem, cerebellum, cortex); symptoms are
more chronic and less severe. Worrisome pathologic types are the
gaze-­paretic or gaze-­evoked oscillations of cerebellar, brainstem, or
cerebral disease.
Nystagmus retractorius or convergent nystagmus is repetitive
jerking of the eyes into the orbit or toward each other. It is usually seen
with vertical gaze palsy as a feature of Parinaud (sylvian aqueduct) syndrome. The causal condition may be neoplastic, vascular, or inflammatory. In children, nystagmus retractorius suggests particularly the
presence of pinealoma or hydrocephalus.
A diagnostic approach to nystagmus is noted in Figures 663.8 and
663.9 and Table 663.4.

Spasmus nutans is a special type of acquired nystagmus in childhood (see also Chapter 637). In its complete form, it is characterized
by the triad of pendular nystagmus, head nodding, and torticollis. The
nystagmus is characteristically very fine, very rapid, horizontal, and
pendular; it is often asymmetric, sometimes unilateral. Signs usually

develop within the first year or two of life. Components of the triad
may develop at various times. In many cases, the condition is benign
and self-­limited, usually lasting a few months, sometimes years. The
cause of this classic type of spasmus nutans, which usually resolves
spontaneously, is unknown. Some children exhibiting signs resembling

those of spasmus nutans have underlying brain tumors, particularly
hypothalamic and chiasmal optic gliomas. Appropriate neurologic and
neuroradiologic evaluation and careful monitoring of infants and children with nystagmus are therefore recommended.

OTHER ABNORMAL EYE MOVEMENTS

To be differentiated from true nystagmus are certain special types of
abnormal eye movements, particularly opsoclonus, ocular dysmetria,
and flutter (Table 663.5).

Opsoclonus

Opsoclonus and ataxic conjugate movements are spontaneous, nonrhythmic, multidirectional, chaotic movements of the eyes. The eyes

appear to be in agitation, with bursts of conjugate movement of varying amplitude in varying directions. Opsoclonus is most often associated with infectious or autoimmune encephalitis. It may be the first
sign of neuroblastoma or other tumors producing a paraneoplastic
syndrome.

Ocular Motor Dysmetria

This is analogous to dysmetria of the limbs. Affected individuals show
a lack of precision in performing movements of refixation, characterized by an overshoot (or undershoot) of the eyes with several corrective to-­and-­fro oscillations on looking from one point to another.
Ocular motor dysmetria is a sign of cerebellar or cerebellar pathway
disease.

PTOSIS

In blepharoptosis, the upper eyelid droops below its normal level. Congenital ptosis is usually a result of a localized dystrophy of the levator
muscle in which the striated muscle fibers are replaced with fibrous
tissue. The condition may be unilateral or bilateral and can be familial,
transmitted as a dominant trait (Figs. 664.1 and 664.2).
Parents often comment that the eye looks smaller because of the
drooping eyelid. The lid crease is decreased or absent where the levator muscle would normally insert below the skin surface. Because the
levator is replaced by fibrous tissue, the lid does not move downward
fully in downgaze (lid lag). If the ptosis is severe, affected children often
attempt to raise the lid by lifting their brow or adapting a chin-­up head
posture to maintain binocular vision.
Marcus Gunn jaw-­winking ptosis (maxillopalpebral synkinesis)
accounts for 5% of ptosis in children. In this syndrome, an abnormal
synkinesis exists between the fifth and third cranial nerves; this causes
the eyelid to elevate with movement of the jaw. The wink is produced
by chewing or sucking and may be more noticeable than the ptosis
itself (Fig. 664.3).
Although ptosis in children is often an isolated finding, it may also
be acquired and occur in association with other ocular or systemic
disorders (Fig. 664.4). Systemic disorders include myasthenia gravis,
muscular dystrophy, Miller Fisher variant of Guillain Barré syndrome,
and botulism. Ocular disorders include mechanical ptosis secondary to
lid tumors, blepharophimosis syndrome, congenital fibrosis syndrome,
combined levator/superior rectus maldevelopment, and congenital or
acquired third nerve palsy. Ptosis may be a sign of cerebral herniation.
A small degree of ptosis is seen in Horner syndrome (see Chapter 662).
A complete ophthalmic and systemic examination is therefore important in the evaluation of a child with ptosis.
Amblyopia may occur in children with ptosis. The amblyopia may
be secondary to the lid covering the visual axis (deprivation) or induced

astigmatism (anisometropia). When amblyopia occurs, it should generally be treated before treating the ptosis.
Treatment of ptosis in a child is indicated for elimination of an
abnormal head posture, improvement in the visual field, prevention of
amblyopia, and restoration of a normal eyelid appearance. The timing
of surgery depends on the degree of ptosis, its cosmetic and functional
severity, the presence or absence of compensatory posturing, the wishes
of the parents, and the discretion of the surgeon. Surgical treatment is
determined by the amount of levator function that is present. A levator
resection may be used in children with moderate to good function. In
patients with poor or absent function, a frontalis suspension procedure
may be necessary. This technique requires that a suspension material
be placed between the frontalis muscle and the tarsus of the eyelid. It
allows patients to use their brow and frontalis muscle more effectively
to raise their eyelid. Amblyopia may still exist even after surgical correction and should be treated if present.

EPICANTHAL FOLDS

These vertical or oblique folds of skin extend on either side of the
bridge of the nose from the brow or lid area, covering the inner canthal region. They are present to some degree in most young children
and become less apparent with age. The folds may be sufficiently broad
to cover the medial aspect of the eye, making the eyes appear crossed
(pseudoesotropia). Epicanthal folds are a common feature of many
syndromes, including chromosomal aberrations (trisomies) and disorders of single genes.

LAGOPHTHALMOS

This is a condition in which complete closure of the lids over the globe
is difficult or impossible. It may be paralytic because of a facial palsy
involving the orbicularis muscle, or spastic, as in thyrotoxicosis. It may
be structural when retraction or shortening of the lids results from
scarring or atrophy consequent to injury (burns) or disease. Children
with various craniosynostosis syndromes can have problematic lagophthalmos. Infants with congenital ichthyosis may have lagophthalmos caused by the restrictive effect of the lids. Lagophthalmos may
accompany proptosis or buphthalmos (enlarged cornea because of
elevated intraocular pressure) when the lids, although normal, cannot
effectively cover the enlarged or protuberant eye. A degree of physiologic lagophthalmos may occur normally during sleep, but functional

lagophthalmos in an unconscious or debilitated patient can be a
problem.
In patients with lagophthalmos, exposure of the eye may lead to
drying, infection, corneal ulceration, or perforation of the cornea; the
result may be loss of vision, even loss of the eye. In lagophthalmos,
protection of the eye by artificial tear preparations, ophthalmic ointment, or moisture chambers is essential. Gauze pads are to be avoided
because the gauze may abrade the cornea. In some cases, surgical closure of the lids (tarsorrhaphy) may be necessary for long-­term protection of the eye.

LID RETRACTION

Pathologic retraction of the lid may be myogenic or neurogenic. Myogenic retraction of the upper lid occurs in thyrotoxicosis, in which it
is associated with three classic signs: a staring appearance (Dalrymple
sign), infrequent blinking (Stellwag sign), and lag of the upper lid on
downward gaze (von Graefe sign).
Neurogenic retraction of the lids may occur in conditions affecting the
anterior mesencephalon. Lid retraction is a feature of the syndrome of
the sylvian aqueduct. In children, it is commonly a sign of hydrocephalus. It may occur with meningitis. Paradoxical retraction of the lid is seen
in the Marcus Gunn jaw-­winking syndrome. It may also be seen with
attempted eye movement after recovery from a third nerve palsy if aberrant regeneration of the oculomotor nerve fibers has occurred.
Simple staring and the physiologic or reflexive lid retraction (“eye
popping”), in contrast to pathologic lid retractions, occur in infants
in response to a sudden reduction in illumination or as a startle
reaction.

ECTROPION, ENTROPION, AND EPIBLEPHARON

Ectropion is eversion of the lid margin; it may lead to overflow of tears
(epiphora) and subsequent maceration of the skin of the lid, inflammation of exposed conjunctiva, or superficial exposure keratopathy.
Common causes are scarring consequent to inflammation, burns, or
trauma and weakness of the orbicularis muscle as a result of facial
palsy; these forms may be corrected surgically. Protection of the cornea is essential. Ectropion is also seen in certain children who have
faulty development of the lateral canthal ligament; this may occur in
Down syndrome.

Medicine. 2018 Sep;97[36]:e12124, Fig. 8B.)

Entropion is inversion of the lid margin, which may cause discomfort and corneal damage because of the inward turning of the lashes
(trichiasis). A principal cause is scarring secondary to inflammation,
such as occurs in trachoma or as a sequela of Stevens-­Johnson syndrome. There is also a rare congenital form. Surgical correction is effective in many cases.
Epiblepharon is commonly seen in childhood and may be confused
with entropion. In epiblepharon, a roll of skin beneath the lower eyelid lashes causes the lashes to be directed vertically and to touch the
cornea (Fig. 664.5). Unlike entropion, the eyelid margin itself is not
rotated toward the cornea. Epiblepharon usually resolves spontaneously. When mild symptoms are present, such as mild ocular irritation,
lubrication is typically recommended. Rarely, corneal scarring may
occur, and surgery may be necessary.

BLEPHAROSPASM

This spastic or repetitive closure of the lids may be caused by irritative
disease of the cornea, conjunctiva, or facial nerve; fatigue or uncorrected refractive error; or common tic. Thorough ophthalmic examination for pathologic causes, such as trichiasis, keratitis, conjunctivitis, or
foreign body, is indicated. Local injection of botulinum toxin may give
relief but frequently must be repeated.

BLEPHARITIS

This inflammation of the lid margins is characterized by erythema and
crusting or scaling; the usual symptoms are irritation, burning, and
itching. The condition is commonly bilateral and chronic or recurrent.
The two main types are staphylococcal and seborrheic. In staphylococcal blepharitis, ulceration of the lid margin is common, the lashes
tend to fall out, and conjunctivitis and superficial keratitis are often
associated. In seborrheic blepharitis, the scales tend to be greasy, the lid
margins are less red, and ulceration usually does not occur. Commonly
blepharitis presents as a combination of the two.

Fig. 664.5 Epiblepharon.
Thorough daily cleansing of the lid margins with a cloth or moistened cotton applicator to remove scales and crusts is important in the
treatment of both forms. Staphylococcal blepharitis is treated with
an antistaphylococcal antibiotic applied directly to the lid margins.
When a child also has seborrhea, concurrent treatment of the scalp is
important.
Pediculosis of the eyelashes may produce a clinical picture of blepharitis. The lice can be smothered with ophthalmic-­grade petrolatum
ointment applied to the lid margin and lashes. Nits should be mechanically removed from the lashes. It should be remembered that pediculosis can represent a sexually transmitted disease.
Mites (Demodex spp.) are an increasingly recognized cause of
blepharitis, including in children and adolescents. Close inspection
of the eyelashes often reveals sheathing of the lash at its base. Tea tree
oil or products containing tea tree oil may be helpful, in addition to
diligent lid hygiene.

3936 Part XXVII u Disorders of the Eye
HORDEOLUM (STYE)

Infection of the glands of the lid may be acute or subacute; tender
focal swelling and redness are noted. The usual agent is Staphylococcus aureus. When the meibomian glands are involved, the lesion is
referred to as an internal hordeolum; the abscess tends to be large and
may point through either the skin or the conjunctival surface. When
the infection involves the glands of Zeis or Moll, the abscess tends to
be smaller and more superficial and points at the lid margin; it is then
referred to as an external hordeolum or stye.
Treatment is frequent warm compresses and, if necessary, surgical
incision and drainage. In addition, topical antibiotic preparations are
often used. Untreated, the infection may progress to cellulitis of the lid
or orbit, requiring the use of systemic antibiotics.

CHALAZION

A chalazion is a granulomatous inflammation of a meibomian gland
characterized by a firm, nontender nodule in the upper or lower lid.
This lesion tends to be chronic and differs from internal hordeolum
in the absence of acute inflammatory signs. Although many chalazia
subside spontaneously, incision and drainage may be necessary if they
become large enough to distort vision (by inducing astigmatism by
exerting pressure on the globe) or become cosmetically unacceptable.
Patients who experience frequent chalazia formation, or those who
have significant corneal changes secondary to the underlying blepharitis, may benefit from systemic, low-­dose erythromycin or azithromycin
treatment.

COLOBOMA OF THE EYELID

This cleftlike deformity may vary from a small indentation or notch
of the free margin of the lid to a large defect involving almost the
entire lid. If the gap is extensive, ulceration and corneal opacities may
result from exposure. Early surgical correction of the lid defect is recommended. Other deformities frequently associated with lid colobomas include dermoid cysts or dermolipomas on the globe; they often
occur in a position corresponding to the site of the lid defect. Lid
colobomas may also be associated with extensive facial malformation,
as in mandibulofacial dysostosis (Franceschetti or Treacher Collins
syndrome).

as a clear, cystic, sinuous conjunctival mass, may provide a clue to
the diagnosis. In some cases, there is also orbital involvement. The
treatment may include sclerosant therapy, percutaneous drainage, or
surgical excision.
Plexiform neuromas of the lids occur in children with neurofibromatosis, often with ptosis as the first sign. The lid may take on an
S-­shaped configuration. The lids may also be involved by other tumors,
such as retinoblastoma, neuroblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma of the
orbit; these conditions are discussed elsewhere.

TUMORS OF THE LID

A number of lid tumors arise from surface structures (the epithelium
and sebaceous glands). Nevi may appear in early childhood; most are
junctional. Compound nevi tend to develop in the prepubertal years
and dermal nevi at puberty. Malignant epithelial tumors (basal cell
carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma) are rare in children, but the
basal cell nevus syndrome and the malignant lesions of xeroderma
pigmentosum and of Rothmund-­Thomson syndrome may develop in
childhood.
Other lid tumors arise from deeper structures (the neural, vascular, and connective tissues). Capillary hemangiomas are especially
common in children (Fig. 664.6). Many tend to regress spontaneously, although they may show alarmingly rapid growth in infancy.
In many cases, the best management of such hemangiomas is patient
observation, allowing spontaneous regression to occur (see Chapter 691). In the case of a rapidly expanding lesion, which may cause
amblyopia by obstructing the visual axis or inducing astigmatism,
treatment should be considered. Systemic propranolol is an effective
treatment without the risks associated with corticosteroid use. Other
treatment options include topical timolol, corticosteroids (systemically or by direct injection), and surgical excision. Cutaneous capillary malformations (e.g., port-­wine stain) can occur as an isolated
lesion or in association with other signs of Sturge-­Weber syndrome.
Affected patients should be monitored for the development of glaucoma. Lymphangiomas (lymphatic malformations) of the lid appear
as firm masses at or soon after birth and tend to enlarge slowly during
the growing years. Associated conjunctival involvement, appearing

THE TEAR FILM

The tear film, which bathes the eye, is a complex structure composed
of three layers. The innermost mucin layer is secreted by the goblet and epithelial cells of the conjunctiva and the acinar cells of the
lacrimal gland. It adds stability and provides an attachment for the
tear film to the conjunctiva and cornea. The middle aqueous layer
constitutes 98% of the tear film and is produced by the main lacrimal gland and accessory lacrimal glands. It contains various electrolytes and proteins as well as antibodies. The outermost lipid layer is
produced largely from the sebaceous meibomian glands of the eyelid
and retards evaporation of the tear film. Tears drain medially into the
punctal openings of the lid margin and flow through the canaliculi
into the lacrimal sac and then through the nasolacrimal duct into

the nose (Fig. 665.1). Preterm infants have reduced tear secretion.
This may mask the diagnosis of a nasolacrimal duct obstruction and
concentrate topically applied medications. Tear production reaches
adult levels at 1-3 months.

DACRYOSTENOSIS

Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (CNLDO), or dacryostenosis, is the most common disorder of the lacrimal system, occurring
in up to 20% of newborn infants. It is usually caused by a failure of
canalization of the epithelial cells (resulting in membrane formation)
that form the nasolacrimal duct as it enters the nose beneath the inferior turbinate (valve of Hasner). Signs of CNLDO may be present at
the time of birth, although the condition may not become evident
until normal tear production develops. Signs of CNLDO include an
excessive tear lake, overflow of tears onto the lid and cheek, and reflux
of mucoid material that is produced in the lacrimal sac. Erythema or
maceration of the skin may result from irritation and rubbing produced by dripping of tears and discharge. If the blockage is complete,
these signs may be severe and continuous. If obstruction is only partial,
the nasolacrimal duct may be capable of draining the basal tear film
that is produced. However, under periods of increased tear production (exposure to cold, wind, sunlight) or increased closure of the distal
end of the nasolacrimal duct (nasal mucosal edema), tear overflow may
become evident or may increase.
Infants at increased risk for CNLDO include those with trisomy
21, EEC (ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, clefting) syndrome,
branchiooculofacial syndrome, craniometaphyseal or craniodiaphyseal dysplasias, LADD (lacrimo-­auriculo-­dento-­digital) syndrome,
CHARGE (coloboma, heart anomaly, choanal atresia, retardation,
genital, and ear anomalies) syndrome, and Goldenhar syndrome
(Table 665.1).
Infants with CNLDO may develop acute infection and inflammation of the nasolacrimal sac (dacryocystitis), inflammation of the surrounding tissues (pericystitis), or, rarely, periorbital cellulitis. With
dacryocystitis, the sac area is swollen, red, and tender, and patients may
have systemic signs of infection such as fever and irritability.
The primary treatment of uncomplicated nasolacrimal duct
obstruction is a regimen of nasolacrimal massage, usually two or

three times daily, accompanied by cleansing of the lids with warm
water. Topical antibiotics are used for control of mucopurulent
drainage. A bland ophthalmic ointment may be used on eyelids if
the skin is macerated. Most cases of CNLDO resolve spontaneously;
96% resolve before 1 year of age. For cases that do not resolve by
1 year, the nasolacrimal duct may be probed, with a cure rate of
approximately 80%. Some ophthalmologists intubate the nasolacrimal system at the same time because this may improve the outcome
of the procedure.
Acute dacryocystitis (Fig. 665.2) requires prompt treatment with
systemic antibiotics. In such cases, some form of definitive surgical
intervention is usually indicated.
A dacryocystocele (mucocele) is an unusual presentation of a nonpatent nasolacrimal sac that is obstructed both proximally and distally. Dacryocystoceles can be seen at birth or shortly after birth as a
bluish subcutaneous mass just below the medial canthal tendon (Figs.
665.3 and 665.4). Initial treatment of dacryocystocele is usually conservative, involving massage/digital decompression of the lacrimal
sac. If resolution of the dacryocystocele is not achieved with conservative management, surgical probing may be beneficial. At times,
the intranasal portion of the nasolacrimal duct becomes distended,
causing respiratory compromise. In one study, 9.5% of infants with
dacryocystocele had related respiratory compromise, and this may be
more common when dacryocystoceles are present bilaterally. These
infants benefit from early probing. When left untreated, dacryocystocele may progress to dacryocystitis/cellulitis, requiring systemic antibiotics and often hospitalization. Once the cellulitis has improved,
the nasolacrimal system should be probed if spontaneous resolution
has not occurred.
Not all tearing in infants and children is caused by nasolacrimal
obstruction. Tearing may also be a sign of glaucoma, intraocular
inflammation, or external irritation, such as that from a corneal abrasion or foreign body.

ALACRIMA AND “DRY EYE”

Alacrima refers to a wide spectrum of disorders with reduced or
absent tear secretion. Occasionally normal basal tearing occurs with
an absence of emotional tearing. Etiologies can be divided into syndromes that have a pathologic association or are inherited. Associated
syndromes include familial dysautonomia (Riley-­Day syndrome),
anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, and triple-­A syndrome (Allgrove
syndrome: achalasia, alacrima, adrenal insufficiency). Examples of
pathologic association include aplasia of cranial nerve nuclei and
lacrimal gland aplasia/hypoplasia. Both autosomal recessive and
autosomal dominant inheritance have been reported in isolated congenital alacrima. In addition, medications with anticholinergic side
effects can decrease tear production. The patients with alacrima have
variable presentation, including no symptoms, photophobia, foreign
body sensation, eye pain, and decreased vision. The symptoms, if
present, often occur early in life. Because the dryness can be severe,
damage to the cornea and subsequent loss of vision may occur. The
goal of treatment is to minimize corneal irritation, corneal scarring,
and loss of vision. Aggressive ocular lubrication is used to prevent
these sequelae.
An acquired abnormality of any layer of the tear film may produce
a dry eye. Commonly acquired disorders that may lead to a decreased
or unstable tear film include Sjögren syndrome, Stevens-­Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, vitamin A deficiency, viral infections of the lacrimal gland, ocular pemphigoid, trachoma, chemical
burns, irradiation, isotretinoin treatment of acne, graft-­versus-­host
disease, and meibomian gland dysfunction. Corneal exposure as a
consequence of poor lid closure or other pathologic states can quickly
lead to pathologically dry eyes. Examples of conditions leading to such
exposure include ichthyosis, xeroderma pigmentosum, and certain

Chapter 666 u Disorders of the Conjunctiva

Chapter 666

Disorders of the
Conjunctiva
Scott E. Olitsky and Justin D. Marsh
CONJUNCTIVITIS

The conjunctiva reacts to a wide range of bacterial and viral agents,
allergens, irritants, toxins, and systemic diseases. Conjunctivitis is
common in childhood and may be infectious or noninfectious. The
differential diagnosis of a red-­appearing eye includes conjunctival disease, as well as other ocular sites (Table 666.1).

Ophthalmia Neonatorum

This form of conjunctivitis, occurring in infants younger than 4 weeks
of age, is the most common eye disease of newborns. Its many different
causal agents vary greatly in their virulence and outcome. Silver nitrate
instillation may result in a mild self-­limited chemical conjunctivitis,
whereas Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Pseudomonas are capable of causing
corneal perforation, blindness, and death. The risk of conjunctivitis in
newborns depends on frequencies of maternal infections, prophylactic
measures, circumstances during labor and delivery, and postdelivery
exposure to microorganisms.

Epidemiology

Conjunctivitis during the neonatal period is usually acquired during
vaginal delivery and reflects the sexually transmitted infections prevalent in the community. The incidence of gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum can be reduced by widespread use of topical silver nitrate or
erythromycin prophylaxis, prenatal screening, and treatment of maternal gonorrhea. Gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum has an incidence
of 0.3/1,000 live births in the United States. In comparison, Chlamydia
trachomatis is the most common organism causing ophthalmia neonatorum in the United States, with an incidence of 8.2/1,000 births.

Clinical Manifestations

The clinical manifestations of the various forms of ophthalmia neonatorum are not specific enough to allow an accurate diagnosis. Although
the timing and character of the signs are somewhat typical for each
cause of this condition, there is considerable overlap, and physicians
should not rely solely on clinical findings. Regardless of its cause, ophthalmia neonatorum is characterized by redness and chemosis (swelling) of the conjunctiva, edema of the eyelids, and discharge, which may
be purulent.
Neonatal conjunctivitis is a potentially blinding condition. The infection may also have associated systemic manifestations that require treatment. Any newborn infant who develops signs of conjunctivitis needs a
prompt and comprehensive systemic and ocular evaluation to determine
the agent causing the infection and the appropriate treatment.
The onset of inflammation caused by silver nitrate drops usually
occurs within 6-­12 hours after birth, with clearing by 24-­48 hours. The
usual incubation period for conjunctivitis caused by N. gonorrhoeae is
2-­5 days, and for that caused by C. trachomatis, 5-­14 days. Gonococcal infection may be present at birth owing to prolonged rupture of
amniotic membranes or be delayed beyond 5 days of life because of
partial suppression by ocular prophylaxis. Gonococcal conjunctivitis
may also begin in infancy after inoculation by the contaminated fingers of adults. The time of onset of disease with other bacteria is highly
variable.
Gonococcal conjunctivitis begins with mild inflammation and a
serosanguineous discharge. Within 24 hours, the discharge becomes
thick and purulent, and tense edema of the eyelids with marked chemosis occurs. If proper treatment is delayed, the infection may spread to

involve the deeper layers of the conjunctivae and the cornea. Complications include corneal ulceration and perforation, iridocyclitis, anterior synechiae, and, rarely, panophthalmitis. Conjunctivitis caused by
C. trachomatis (inclusion blennorrhea) may vary from mild inflammation to severe swelling of the eyelids with copious purulent discharge.
The process involves mainly the tarsal conjunctivae; the corneas are
rarely affected. Conjunctivitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus or other
organisms is similar to that produced by C. trachomatis. Conjunctivitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is uncommon, acquired in the
nursery, and a potentially serious process. It is characterized by the
appearance on days 5-­18 of edema, erythema of the lids, purulent discharge, pannus formation, endophthalmitis, sepsis, shock, and death.

Diagnosis

Conjunctivitis appearing after 48 hours should be evaluated for a possibly infectious cause. Gram stain of the purulent discharge should be
performed and tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for gonococcus. If a viral cause is suspected, a swab should be submitted for
PCR testing. In chlamydial conjunctivitis, the diagnosis is made by
tests for chlamydial antigen or DNA. The differential diagnosis of
ophthalmia neonatorum includes dacryocystitis caused by congenital
nasolacrimal duct obstruction with lacrimal sac distention (dacryocystocele; see Chapter 665).

Treatment

Treatment of infants in whom gonococcal ophthalmia is suspected
where the Gram stain shows the characteristic intracellular Gram-­
negative diplococci should be initiated immediately with ceftriaxone,
25-­50 mg/kg/24 hr for one dose IV or IM, not to exceed 125 mg. The
eye should also be irrigated initially with saline every 10-­30 minutes,
gradually increasing to 2-­hour intervals until the purulent discharge
has cleared. Treatment (ceftriaxone 25-­50 mg/kg/day, IM or IV in a
single daily dose for 7 days, with cefotaxime 25 mg/kg q 12 hr substituted if the patient has hyperbilirubinemia) is extended if sepsis or
other extraocular sites are involved. Associated meningitis is treated
for 10-­14 days. Neonatal conjunctivitis secondary to chlamydial infections is treated with oral erythromycin (50 mg/kg/24 hr in four divided
doses) for 2 weeks. This cures conjunctivitis and may prevent subsequent chlamydial pneumonia. Pseudomonas neonatal conjunctivitis is
treated with systemic antibiotics, including an aminoglycoside, plus
local saline irrigation and gentamicin ophthalmic ointment. Staphylococcal conjunctivitis is treated with parenteral methicillin and local
saline irrigation.

Prognosis and Prevention

Before the institution of topical ophthalmic prophylaxis at birth, gonococcal ophthalmia was a common cause of blindness or permanent eye
damage. If properly applied, this form of prophylaxis is highly effective
unless infection is present at birth. Drops of 0.5% erythromycin or 1%
silver nitrate are instilled directly into the open eyes at birth using wax
or plastic single-­dose containers. Saline irrigation after silver nitrate
application is unnecessary. Silver nitrate is ineffective against active
infection and may have limited use against Chlamydia. Povidone-­
iodine (2% solution) may also be an effective prophylactic agent, especially in developing countries.
Identification of maternal gonococcal infection and appropriate
treatment has become a standard element of routine prenatal care.
An infant born to a woman who has untreated gonococcal infection
should receive a single dose of ceftriaxone, 50 mg/kg (maximum 125
mg) IV or IM, in addition to topical prophylaxis. The dose should be
reduced for premature infants. Penicillin (50,000 units) should be used
if the mother’s gonococcal isolate is known to be penicillin sensitive.
Neither topical prophylaxis nor topical treatment prevents the afebrile pneumonia that occurs in 10–20% of infants exposed to C. trachomatis. Although chlamydial conjunctivitis is often a self-­limiting
disease, chlamydial pneumonia may have serious consequences. It is
important that infants with chlamydial disease receive systemic treatment. Treatment of colonized pregnant people with erythromycin may
prevent neonatal disease.

Acute Purulent Conjunctivitis

This is characterized by more or less generalized (bilateral in 50–75%)
conjunctival hyperemia, edema, mucopurulent exudate, glued eyes (lids
stuck together after sleeping), and various degrees of ocular pain and
discomfort. It is usually a result of bacterial infection. In addition, there
is usually little or no pruritus or periauricular lymph node enlargement;

the peak season is between December and April. Bacterial conjunctivitis
is more common in young children (<5 years), whereas viral conjunctivitis is more common among adolescents and adults. The most frequent
causes are nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (60–80%; associated
with ipsilateral otitis media), pneumococci (20%), and staphylococci
(5–10%). Bacterial purulent conjunctivitis, especially that caused by

pneumococcus or H. influenzae, may occur in epidemics. Conjunctival smear and culture are helpful in differentiating specific types. These
common forms of acute purulent conjunctivitis usually respond well
to warm compresses and topical instillation of antibiotic drops, which
shortens the duration of illness and hastens return to school. Topical
antibiotics include aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramycin), quinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, moxifloxacin), and combinations
of antibiotics and chloramphenicol (Table 666.2). Brazilian purpuric
fever caused by Haemophilus aegyptius manifests as conjunctivitis and
sepsis. Hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis is caused by gonococcal or
meningococcal infection and requires systemic, not topical, antimicrobial therapies. Concerning symptoms that should require an ophthalmology referral include vision loss, severe purulent discharge, corneal
involvement, conjunctival scarring, cutaneous-­conjunctival involvement (Stevens-­Johnson syndrome), recurrent symptoms, severe pain,
herpes simplex virus infection, severe photophobia, and involvement
with a contact (cosmetic or prescription) lens.

Viral Conjunctivitis

less common in children than in adults. Children may have associated
upper respiratory tract infection and pharyngitis. No specific medical
therapy is available to decrease the symptoms or shorten the course of
the disease. Emphasis must be placed on prevention of spread of the
disease. A replicating virus is present in 95% of patients 10 days after
the appearance of symptoms.
Pharyngoconjunctival fever presents with high fever, pharyngitis, bilateral conjunctivitis, and periauricular lymphadenopathy. It is
highly contagious.

Membranous and Pseudomembranous Conjunctivitis

These types of conjunctivitis can be encountered in a number of diseases. The classic membranous conjunctivitis is that of diphtheria,
accompanied by a fibrin-­rich exudate that forms on the conjunctival
surface and permeates the epithelium; the membrane is removed with
difficulty and leaves raw bleeding areas. In pseudomembranous conjunctivitis, the layer of fibrin-­rich exudate is superficial and can often
be stripped easily, leaving the surface smooth. This type occurs with

This is generally characterized by a watery discharge. Follicular changes
(small aggregates of lymphocytes) are often found in the palpebral conjunctiva. Involvement is often unilateral and associated with periauricular nodes. Viral conjunctivitis occurs more often in the summer
and in older children (>5 years). Conjunctivitis resulting from adenovirus infection is relatively common, sometimes with corneal involvement as well as pharyngitis or pneumonia. Outbreaks of conjunctivitis
caused by enterovirus are also encountered; this type may be hemorrhagic (Fig. 666.1). Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis may be epidemic
because of enterovirus CA24 or 70 and is characterized by red, swollen,
and painful eyes with a hemorrhagic watery discharge. Conjunctivitis
is commonly associated with such systemic viral infections as childhood exanthems, particularly measles. Viral conjunctivitis is usually
self-­limited.

Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis

This is caused by adenovirus serotypes 8, 19, or 37, and is transmitted
by direct contact. It initially presents as a sensation of a foreign body
beneath the lids, with itching and burning. Edema (chemosis) and
photophobia develop rapidly, and large oval follicles appear within the
conjunctiva. Preauricular adenopathy and a pseudomembrane on the
conjunctival surface occur frequently. Subepithelial corneal infiltrates
may develop and may cause blurring of vision; these usually disappear
but may permanently reduce visual acuity. Corneal complications are

Fig. 666.1 Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) is a highly conta-

gious conjunctivitis that presents with symptoms of pain, redness, and
tearing. Ocular findings include extensive subconjunctival hemorrhages, follicles, and chemosis. Causative agents include coxsackie group
A24 (CA24) and enterovirus E70 (EV70). (From Krachmer JH, Palay DA.

many bacterial and viral infections, including staphylococcal, pneumococcal, streptococcal, or chlamydial conjunctivitis, and in epidemic
keratoconjunctivitis. It is also found in vernal conjunctivitis and in
Stevens-­Johnson disease.

Allergic Conjunctivitis

This is usually accompanied by intense itching, clear watery discharge,
and conjunctival edema (chemosis) (see Chapter 188). It is commonly
seasonal (spring-­summer). Cold compresses and topical antihistamine
drops give symptomatic relief. Topical mast cell stabilizers or prostaglandin inhibitors may also help. In selected cases, topical corticosteroids are used under an ophthalmologist’s supervision but should not
be used routinely or for a long time.

Vernal Conjunctivitis

This usually begins in the prepubertal years and may recur for many
years. Atopy appears to have a role in its origin, but the pathogenesis is
uncertain. Extreme itching and tearing are the usual complaints. Large,
flattened, cobblestone-­like papillary lesions of the palpebral conjunctivae are characteristic (Fig. 666.2). A stringy exudate and a milky
conjunctival pseudomembrane are frequently present. Small elevated
lesions of the bulbar conjunctiva adjacent to the limbus (Horner-­
Trantas dots) may be found. Smear of the conjunctival exudate reveals
many eosinophils. Topical corticosteroid therapy and cold compresses
afford some relief. Topical mast cell stabilizers or prostaglandin inhibitors are useful when long-­term control is needed. The long-­term use of
corticosteroids should be avoided.

bulbs, and industrial pollutants. Alkalis tend to linger in the conjunctival tissues and continue to inflict damage for hours or days. Acids
precipitate the proteins in tissues and so produce their effect immediately. In either case, prompt, thorough, and copious irrigation is crucial. Extensive tissue damage, even loss of the eye, can result, especially
if the offending agent is an alkali.

OTHER CONJUNCTIVAL DISORDERS

Subconjunctival hemorrhage is manifested by bright or dark red
patches in the bulbar conjunctiva and may result from injury or inflammation. It commonly occurs spontaneously. It may occasionally result
from severe sneezing or coughing. Rarely, it may be a manifestation of
a blood dyscrasia. Subconjunctival hemorrhages are self-­limiting and
require no treatment.
Pinguecula is a yellowish white, slightly elevated mass on the bulbar
conjunctiva, usually in the interpalpebral region (Fig. 666.4). It represents elastic and hyaline degenerative changes of the conjunctiva. No
treatment is required except for cosmetic reasons, in which case simple
excision suffices.
Pterygium is a fleshy triangular conjunctival lesion that may
encroach on the cornea. It typically occurs in the nasal interpalpebral region (Fig. 666.5). The pathologic findings are similar to those

Parinaud Oculoglandular Syndrome

This represents a form of cat-­scratch disease and is caused by Bartonella henselae, which is transmitted from cat to cat by fleas (see Chapter
255). Kittens are more likely than adult cats to be infected. Humans
can become infected when they are scratched by a cat. In addition,
bacteria may pass from a cat’s saliva to its fur during grooming. The
bacteria can then be deposited on the conjunctiva after rubbing one’s
eyes after handling the cat. Lymphadenopathy and conjunctivitis are
hallmarks of the disease. Conjunctival granulomas may develop (Fig.
666.3). The course is generally self-­limited, but antibiotics may be
used in some cases.

Chemical Conjunctivitis

This can result when an irritating substance enters the conjunctival
sac (as in the acute but benign conjunctivitis caused by silver nitrate
in newborns). Other common offenders are household cleaning substances (including detergent pods), sprays, smoke, smog, metal halide

opacities in adult life. All modes of inheritance have been described,
although X-­linked recessive is the most common. Systemic abnormalities that may be associated with megalocornea include Marfan
syndrome, craniosynostosis, and Alport syndrome. The cause of the
enlargement of the cornea and the anterior segment is unknown, but
possible explanations include a defect in the growth of the optic cup
and an arrest of congenital glaucoma.
Pathologic corneal enlargement caused by glaucoma is to be differentiated from this anomaly. Any progressive increase in the size of the
cornea, especially when accompanied by photophobia, lacrimation, or
haziness of the cornea, requires prompt ophthalmologic evaluation.

MICROCORNEA

of a pinguecula. The development of pterygia is related to exposure
to ultraviolet light, and it therefore is more commonly found among
people who live near the equator. Removal is suggested when the lesion
encroaches far onto the cornea. Recurrence after removal is common.
Dermoid cyst and dermolipoma are benign lesions, clinically similar in appearance. They are smooth, elevated, round to oval lesions
of various sizes. The color varies from yellowish white to fleshy pink.
The most frequent site is the upper outer quadrant of the globe; they
also commonly occur near or straddling the limbus. Dermolipoma is
composed of adipose and connective tissue. Dermoid cysts may also
contain glandular tissue, hair follicles, and hair shafts. Excision for
cosmetic reasons is feasible. Dermolipomas are often connected to the
extraocular muscles, making their complete removal impossible without sacrificing ocular motility.
Conjunctival nevus is a small, slightly elevated lesion that may vary
in pigmentation from pale salmon to dark brown. It is usually benign,
but careful observation for progressive growth or changes suggestive of
malignancy is advised.
Symblepharon is a cicatricial adhesion between the conjunctiva
of the lid and the globe; the lower lid is usually affected. It follows
operation or injuries, especially burns from lye, acids, or molten
metals. It is a serious complication of Stevens-­Johnson syndrome.
It may interfere with motion of the eyeball and may cause diplopia.
The adhesions should be separated and the raw surfaces kept from
uniting during healing. Grafts of oral mucous membrane may be
necessary.

Microcornea, or anterior microphthalmia, is an abnormally small
cornea in an otherwise relatively normal eye. It may be familial,
with transmission being dominant more often than recessive. More
commonly, a small cornea is just one feature of an otherwise developmentally abnormal or microphthalmic eye; associated defects
include colobomas, microphakia, congenital cataract, glaucoma, and
aniridia.

KERATOCONUS

This is a disease of unclear pathogenesis characterized by progressive thinning and bulging of the central cornea, which becomes cone
shaped. Although familial cases are known, most cases are sporadic. It
is a common ocular condition with an incidence of 1 in 2,000 adults.
Eye rubbing and contact lens wear have been implicated as pathogenic,
but the evidence to support this is equivocal. The incidence is increased
in individuals with atopy, Down syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and retinitis pigmentosa.
Most cases are bilateral, but involvement may be asymmetric.
The disorder usually presents and progresses rapidly during adolescence; progression then slows and stabilizes when patients reach full
growth. Descemet’s membrane may occasionally be stretched beyond
its elastic breaking point, causing an acute rupture in the membrane
with resultant sudden and marked corneal edema (acute hydrops,
Fig. 667.1) and decrease in vision. The corneal edema resolves as
endothelial cells cover the defective area. Some degree of corneal
scarring occurs, but the visual acuity is often better than before the
initial incident. Signs of keratoconus include Munson sign (bulging of the lower eyelid on looking downward) and the presence of
a Fleischer ring (a deposit of iron in the epithelium at the base of
the cone). Glasses and contact lenses are the first step in treating the
visual distortion caused by keratoconus. Corneal cross-­linking is a
procedure using riboflavin and UV light and may arrest the progression of keratoconus. If the cornea vaults too severely for the vision to
be corrected with contact lenses, then a corneal transplant must be
performed to restore vision.

MEGALOCORNEA

This is a nonprogressive symmetric condition characterized by an
enlarged cornea (>12 mm in diameter) and an anterior segment in
which there is no evidence of previous or concurrent ocular hypertension (glaucoma). High myopia is frequently present and may lead to
reduced vision. A frequent complication is the development of lens

Loss of the normal transparency of the cornea in neonates may occur
secondary to either intrinsic hereditary or extrinsic environmental
causes (Table 667.1).

SCLEROCORNEA

In sclerocornea, the normally translucent cornea is replaced by sclera-­
like tissue. Instead of a clearly demarcated cornea, white, feathery, often
ill-­defined, and vascularized tissue develops in the peripheral cornea,
appearing to blend with and extend from the sclera. The central cornea is usually clearer, but total replacement of the cornea with sclera
may occur. The curvature of the cornea is often flatter, similar to the
sclera. Potentially coexisting abnormalities include a shallow anterior
chamber, iris abnormalities, and microphthalmos. This condition is
usually bilateral. In approximately 50% of cases, a dominant or recessive inheritance has been described. Sclerocornea has been reported
in association with numerous systemic abnormalities including limb
deformities, craniofacial defects, and genitourinary disorders. In generalized sclerocornea, especially if bilateral, early corneal transplantation should be considered in an effort to provide vision.

3944 Part XXVII u Disorders of the Eye
Sclerocornea is classified into one of the congenital corneal opacity
disorders with cornea plana if it involves peripheral scleralization or a
total sclerocornea disorder such as Peters anomaly.

PETERS ANOMALY

Fig. 667.1 Acute hydrops from keratoconus with significant corneal
edema.

Peters anomaly (irido-­corneo-­trabecular dysgenesis) is a bilateral central corneal opacity (leukoma) that is present at birth (Fig. 667.2). It
is often associated with iridocorneal adhesions that extend from the
iris collarette to the border of the corneal opacity. Approximately 50%
of patients have other ocular abnormalities, which may include cataracts, glaucoma, and microphthalmia. As many as 80% of cases may be
bilateral, and 60% are associated with systemic malformations (Peters
plus syndrome), which may include short stature, developmental
delay, cleft lip and/or palate, dysmorphic facial features, and cardiac,
genitourinary, and central nervous system malformations. Peters plus
syndrome is an autosomal recessive (B3GLCT gene) disorder.
Some investigators have divided Peters anomaly into two types: a
mesodermal or neuroectodermal form (type 1), which does not show

has a branching, treelike pattern that can be demonstrated by fluorescein staining (Fig. 667.5). The acute episode is accompanied by pain,
photophobia, tearing, blepharospasm, and conjunctival injection. Specific treatment may include mechanical debridement of the involved
corneal epithelium to remove the source of infection and eliminate
an antigenic stimulus to inflammation in the adjacent stroma. Medical treatment may include the use of topical trifluridine, topical ganciclovir, or systemic acyclovir/valacyclovir. In addition, a cycloplegic
agent is useful to relieve pain from spasm of the ciliary muscle. Overly
aggressive topical antiviral treatment itself can be toxic to the cornea
and should be avoided. Recurrent infection and deep stromal involvement can lead to corneal scarring and loss of vision.
Topical use of corticosteroids causes exacerbation of superficial herpetic disease of the eye and may lead to corneal perforation; eye drops
combining steroids and antibiotics are therefore to be avoided in treatment of red eye, unless there are clear-­cut indications for their use and
close supervision during therapy.
Infants born to mothers infected with herpes simplex virus should
be examined carefully for signs of ocular involvement. Intravenous
acyclovir is required for treatment of ocular herpes in newborns.

anomaly.

associated lens changes, and a surface ectodermal form (type 2), which
does. Histologic findings include a focal absence of Descemet’s membrane and corneal endothelium in the region of the opacity. Peters
anomaly may be caused by incomplete migration and differentiation
of the precursor cells of the central corneal endothelium and Descemet’s membrane, or a defective separation between the primitive
lens and cornea during embryogenesis. Peters anomaly may be autosomal recessive (CYP1B1 gene) or autosomal dominant (FOXC1, PAX6,
PITX2 genes).

CORNEAL DYSTROPHIES

These are rare inherited disorders that may present at birth, during childhood, or during early adulthood with bilateral involvement
(although severity may be asymmetric) and that progress with time
(Table 667.2). In most, inheritance is autosomal dominant with variable expression; the most common pathogenic variant is in TGFB1,
which is associated with the granular corneal dystrophy types 1 and 2,
as well as lattice corneal dystrophy. Congenital hereditary endothelial
dystrophy is both an autosomal recessive and dominant disorder; the
recessive form presents at birth and is more severe (Fig. 667.3; see also
Table 667.2); three variants are X-­linked.

DERMOIDS

Epibulbar dermoids are choristomas. They are often present at birth
and may increase in size with age. They occur most frequently in the
lower temporal quadrant. They most commonly straddle the limbus
and extend into the peripheral cornea (Fig. 667.4). Rarely, they may be
confined entirely to the cornea or conjunctiva. Epibulbar (or limbal)
dermoids may cause visual disturbance by encroaching on the visual
axis or by contributing to the development of astigmatism, which may
lead to amblyopia.
A dermoid usually appears as a well-­circumscribed, rounded or oval,
gray or pinkish-­yellow mass with a dry surface from which short hairs
may protrude. It may affect only the superficial layers of the cornea,
although full-­thickness involvement is common. Associated ocular
anomalies include eyelid and iris colobomas, microphthalmos, and
retinal and choroidal defects. A total of 30% of dermoids are associated
with systemic abnormalities. Many of the associated anomalies involve
developmental defects of the first branchial arch (vertebral anomalies,
dysostosis of the facial bones, ear anomalies and dental anomalies, and
Goldenhar syndrome). Epibulbar dermoids are found in 75% of cases
of Goldenhar syndrome.

DENDRITIC KERATITIS

Infection of the cornea with the herpes simplex virus produces a characteristic lesion of the corneal epithelium, referred to as a dendrite; it

CORNEAL ULCERS

The usual signs and symptoms are focal or diffuse corneal haze, hyperemia, lid edema, pain, photophobia, tearing, and blepharospasm. It is
important to distinguish a corneal ulcer from that of a corneal abrasion. Although a corneal abrasion involves loss of the epithelial layer of
the cornea and subsequently stains with topical fluorescein, a corneal
ulcer also has underlying stromal infiltration and appears white or hazy
on examination. Corneal ulcers can be infectious or noninfectious in
origin. Hypopyon (pus in the anterior chamber) is common, particularly when the cause is infection. Regardless of cause, corneal ulcers
require prompt treatment. Infectious cases result most frequently
from contact lens wear and traumatic lesions that become secondarily
infected. Although many organisms are capable of infecting the cornea,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be particularly devastating because it can
rapidly destroy stromal tissue and lead to corneal perforation. Neisseria gonorrhoeae also is particularly damaging to the cornea. Indolent
ulcers may be caused by fungi, often in association with the use of contact lenses. In each case, scrapings of the cornea must be studied in an
effort to identify the infectious agent and determine the best therapy.
Although aggressive local treatment is generally needed to save the eye,
systemic treatment may be necessary in some cases as well. Perforation
or scarring resulting from corneal ulceration is an important cause of
blindness throughout the world and is estimated to be responsible for
10% of blindness in the United States.
Unexplained corneal ulcers in infants and young children should
raise the question of a sensory defect, as in Riley-­Day or Goldenhar-­
Gorlin syndrome, or of a metabolic disorder, such as tyrosinemia
(Fig. 667.6). Corneal ulceration can also occur as a consequence
of severe vitamin deficiencies, such as those seen with malabsorption in cystic fibrosis or restrictive eating disorders. Peripherally
located inflammatory ulcers are commonly associated with blepharitis and typically require both topical antibiotic and corticosteroid
treatment.

PHLYCTENULES

These are small, yellowish, slightly elevated lesions usually located
at the corneal limbus; they may encroach on the cornea and extend
centrally. A small corneal ulcer is often found at the head of the
advancing lesion, with a fascicle of blood vessels behind the head
of the lesion. Although once thought to represent a sign of systemic
tuberculin infection, phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis is a morphologic expression of delayed hypersensitivity to diverse antigens. In
children, it commonly occurs as a result of a hypersensitivity reaction to nonpathogenic staphylococcal strains at the eyelid margin.
Treatment usually consists of eliminating the underlying disorder,
usually staphylococcal blepharitis or meibomianitis, and suppressing
the immune response with the use of topical corticosteroid therapy.
A superficial stromal pannus and scarring sometimes remain after
treatment.

INTERSTITIAL KERATITIS

This denotes nonulcerative inflammation of the corneal stroma. There
is a diverse list of causes of interstitial keratitis (IK), including bacterial, viral, parasitic, and inflammatory etiologies (Table 667.3). In the
United States, herpesvirus infections and congenital syphilis account
for the majority of cases of IK. Although the corneal findings may
regress with time, “ghost vessels,” which represent the previous vascular changes, and patchy corneal scarring remain and serve as permanent stigmata of the disease.
Cogan syndrome is an autoimmune IK associated with hearing loss and vestibular symptoms. Although its cause is unknown, a

systemic vasculitis is suspected. Prompt treatment is required to avoid
permanent hearing loss. Both the corneal changes and the auditory
involvement may respond to the use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents.

CORNEAL MANIFESTATIONS OF SYSTEMIC
DISEASE

Several metabolic diseases produce distinctive corneal changes in
childhood. Refractile polychromatic crystals are deposited throughout the cornea in cystinosis (see Chapter 105.4). Corneal deposits
producing various degrees of corneal haze also occur in certain types

Chapter 668 u Abnormalities of the Lens

Chapter 668

Abnormalities of the Lens
Scott E. Olitsky and Justin D. Marsh
CATARACTS

A cataract is any opacity of the lens (Fig. 668.1). Some are clinically
unimportant; others significantly affect visual function. The incidence
of infantile cataracts is approximately 2-­13/10,000 live births. Approximately 60% of cataracts are an isolated defect, 22% are part of a syndrome, and the remaining cases are associated with other unrelated
major birth defects. Cataracts are more common in low birthweight
infants. Infants who weigh at or below 2,500 g have a three-­to fourfold
increased odds of developing infantile cataracts. Some cataracts are
associated with other ocular or systemic diseases.

Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of cataracts in infants and children
includes a wide range of developmental disorders, infectious and
inflammatory processes, metabolic diseases, and toxic and traumatic insults (Table 668.1). Cataracts may also develop secondary
to intraocular processes, such as retinopathy of prematurity, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous, retinal detachment, retinitis
pigmentosa, and uveitis. Finally, a fraction of cataracts in children
are inherited (Fig. 668.2).

Developmental Variants

Early developmental processes may lead to various congenital lens
opacities. Discrete dots or white plaquelike opacities of the lens capsule are common and sometimes involve the contiguous subcapsular
region. Small opacities of the posterior capsule may be associated with
persistent remnants of the primitive hyaloid vascular system (the common Mittendorf dot), whereas those of the anterior capsule may be
associated with persistent strands of the pupillary membrane or vascular sheath of the lens. Congenital cataracts of this type are usually
stationary and rarely interfere with vision, but in some cases, progression occurs.

Prematurity

A special type of lens change seen in some preterm newborn infants is
the so-­called cataract of prematurity. The appearance is of a cluster of
tiny vacuoles in the distribution of the Y sutures of the lens. They can
be visualized with an ophthalmoscope and are best seen with the pupil
well dilated. The pathogenesis is unclear. In most cases, the opacities
disappear spontaneously, often within a few weeks.

Fig. 668.1 Leukocoria secondary to cataract.

3949

Mendelian Inheritance

Many isolated, idiopathic cataracts unassociated with other diseases
are hereditary. There are ∼35 genes associated with isolated pediatric
cataracts; ∼40% are inherited as autosomal dominants, ∼20% are autosomal recessive, and ∼35% have both dominant and recessive traits.
Twelve crystallin gene pathologic variants are the most frequently
identified genetic etiologies for both autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance patterns. Other involved genes include transcription
factors, membrane proteins, and cytoskeletal proteins.

Congenital Infection Syndrome

Cataracts in infants and children can be a result of prenatal infection.
Lens opacity may occur in any of the major congenital infection syndromes (e.g., toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, syphilis, rubella, herpes
simplex virus). Cataracts may also occur secondary to other perinatal
infections, including measles, poliomyelitis, influenza, varicella-­zoster,
and vaccinia.

Metabolic Disorders

Cataracts are a prominent manifestation of many metabolic diseases, particularly certain disorders of carbohydrate, amino acid,
calcium, and copper metabolism. A primary consideration in any
infant with cataracts is the possibility of galactosemia (see Chapter 107.2). In classic infantile galactosemia, galactose-­1-­phosphate
uridyltransferase deficiency, the cataract is typically of the zonular
type, with haziness or opacification of one or more of the perinuclear layers of the lens. Haziness or clouding of the nucleus also
often occurs. In its early stages, the cataract generally has a distinctive oil droplet appearance and is best detected with the pupil fully
dilated. Progression to complete opacification of the lens may occur
within weeks. With early treatment (galactose-­free diet), the lens
changes may be reversible.
In galactokinase deficiency, cataracts are the sole clinical manifestation. The cataracts are usually zonular and may appear in the first few
months of life, first few years of life, or later in childhood.
In children with juvenile-­onset diabetes mellitus, lens changes are
uncommon. Some develop snowflake-­like white opacities and vacuoles of the lens. Others develop cataracts that may progress and mature
rapidly, sometimes in a matter of days, especially during adolescence.
An antecedent event may be the sudden development of myopia caused
by changes in the optical density of the lens. Congenital lens opacities may be seen in children of diabetic and prediabetic mothers (see
Chapter 147).
Hypoglycemia in neonates can also be associated with early development of cataracts. Ketotic hypoglycemia is also associated with
cataracts.
An association between cataracts and hypocalcemia is well established. Various lens opacities may be seen in patients with hypoparathyroidism (see Chapter 611).
The oculocerebral renal syndrome of Lowe is associated with cataracts in infants. Affected male children frequently have dense bilateral cataracts at birth, often in association with glaucoma and miotic
pupils. Punctate lens opacities are frequently present in heterozygous
females.
The distinctive sunflower cataract of Wilson disease is not commonly seen in children. Various lens opacities may be seen in children
with certain of the sphingolipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses, and
mucolipidoses, particularly Niemann-­Pick disease, mucosulfatidosis,
Fabry disease, and aspartylglycosaminuria.
Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is an autosomal recessive
metabolic storage disease involving a pathogenic variant in an enzyme
used during bile acid synthesis, leading to accumulation of cholesterol
in the brain and elsewhere. In addition to cataract formation in childhood, patients may develop chronic diarrhea in infancy and progressive cognitive and neurologic impairment later in life. Early detection
is vital as cataract formation may occur before permanent neurologic
impairment, providing a window of time to treat the condition. Treatment typically consists of oral chenodeoxycholic acid.

cataracts is unclear. The effect on vision depends on the extent and
density of the opacity. In many cases, the acuity is only minimally or
moderately impaired. Reversibility of steroid-­induced cataracts may
occur in some cases. All children receiving long-­term steroid treatment
should have periodic eye examinations.
Trauma to the eye is a major cause of cataracts in children (Fig.
668.3). Opacification of the lens may result from blunt or penetrating injury. Cataracts can be an important manifestation of child
abuse.
Cataract formation after exposure to therapeutic radiation is dose
and duration dependent. Adult research shows 50% occurrence in lens
dose of 15 Gy. Delayed onset is the rule.

Miscellaneous Disorders

The list of multisystem syndromes and diseases associated with lens
opacities and other eye anomalies is extensive (see Table 668.1).

Treatment

The treatment of cataracts that significantly interfere with vision includes
the following: (1) surgical removal of lens material to provide an optically
clear visual axis; (2) correction of the resultant aphakic refractive error
with spectacles, contact lenses, or intraocular lens implantation; and (3)
correction of any associated sensory deprivation amblyopia. Because the
use of spectacles may not be possible in children after cataract removal, the
use of contact lenses for visual rehabilitation is sometimes a medical necessity. Intraocular lens implantation is the mainstay for visual rehabilitation
in children 2 years or older. A multicenter trial studied the visual outcomes
in very young children treated with a contact lens versus an intraocular
lens implant. One year after treatment, the children randomized into the
intraocular lens implant group had more intraoperative complications,
adverse events, and need for additional intraocular surgery. Although the
median visual acuity was better in the contact lens group, the difference
did not reach statistical significance. Treatment of the amblyopia may be
the most demanding and difficult step in the visual rehabilitation of infants
or children with cataracts. Not all cataracts require surgical intervention.
Cataracts that are not visually significant should be monitored for change,
and the child should be monitored for the development of amblyopia.

Fig. 668.4 Complete dislocation of lens into the anterior chamber
seen in Weill-­Marchesani syndrome.

Prognosis

Prognosis depends on many factors, including the nature of the cataract, the underlying disease, age at onset, age at intervention, duration
and severity of any attendant amblyopia, and presence of any associated
ocular abnormalities (e.g., microphthalmia, retinal lesions, optic atrophy,
glaucoma, nystagmus, and strabismus). Persistent amblyopia is the most
common cause of poor visual recovery after cataract surgery in children.
Secondary conditions and complications may develop in children who
have had cataract surgery, including inflammatory sequelae, secondary
membranes, glaucoma, retinal detachment, and changes in the axial length
of the eye. All of these should be considered in planning treatment.

ECTOPIA LENTIS

Normally the lens is suspended in place behind the iris diaphragm by
the zonular fibers of the ciliary body. Abnormalities of the suspensory
system resulting from a developmental defect, disease, or trauma may
result in instability or displacement of the lens. Displacement of the
lens is classified as luxation, which is complete displacement of the
lens (also known as dislocation) (Fig. 668.4), or as subluxation, which
is a partial displacement (Fig. 668.5). Symptoms include blurring of
vision, which is often the result of refractive changes such as myopia,

Fig. 668.5 Marfan syndrome. Upward lens subluxation. (From Hoyt

CS, Taylor D. Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus. 4th ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier; 2013: Fig. 35.9A, p. 333.)

astigmatism, or aphakic hyperopia. Some patients experience diplopia
(double vision). An important sign of displacement is iridodonesis, a
tremulousness of the iris caused by the loss of its usual support. Also,
the anterior chamber may appear deeper than normal. Sometimes the
equatorial region (“edge”) of the displaced lens may be visible in the
pupillary aperture. On ophthalmoscopy, this may appear as a black
crescent. Also, the difference between the phakic and aphakic portions
can be appreciated when focusing on the fundus.

Differential Diagnosis

A major cause of lens displacement is trauma. Displacement may also
occur as a result of ocular disease, such as uveitis, intraocular tumor,
congenital glaucoma, high myopia, megalocornea, or aniridia, or in
association with cataract. Ectopia lentis may also be inherited or associated with systemic disease.

3952 Part XXVII u Disorders of the Eye
Displacement of the lens occurring as a heritable ocular condition
unassociated with systemic abnormalities is referred to as simple ectopia lentis. Simple ectopia lentis is usually transmitted as an autosomal
dominant condition. The lens is generally displaced upward and temporally. The ectopia may be present at birth or may appear later in life.
Another form of heritable dislocation is ectopia lentis et pupillae (see
Chapter 662). In this condition, both the lens and pupil are displaced,
usually in opposite directions. This condition is generally bilateral,
with one eye being almost a mirror image of the other. Ectopia lentis et pupillae is an autosomal recessive condition, although variable
expression with some intermingling with simple ectopia lentis has
been reported.
Systemic disorders associated with displacement of the lens include
Marfan syndrome, homocystinuria, Weill-­Marchesani syndrome, and
sulfite oxidase deficiency. Ectopia lentis occurs in approximately 80%
of patients with Marfan syndrome. In approximately 50% of patients
with Marfan syndrome, the ectopia is evident by 5 years of age. In
most cases, the lens is displaced superiorly and temporally; it is almost
always bilateral and relatively symmetric. In homocystinuria, the lens
is usually displaced inferiorly and somewhat nasally. The subluxation
of the lens occurs early in life and is often evident by 5 years of age.
In Weill-­Marchesani syndrome, the displacement of the lens is often
downward and forward, and the lens tends to be small and round.
Ectopia lentis is also associated occasionally with other conditions,
including Ehlers-­
Danlos, Sturge-­
Weber, Crouzon, and Klippel-­
Feil
syndromes; oxycephaly; and mandibulofacial dysostosis. A syndrome
of dominantly inherited blepharoptosis, high myopia, and ectopia lentis has also been described.

Treatment and Prognosis

Displacement of the lens often results only in optical problems. In
some cases, however, more serious complications may develop, such as
glaucoma, uveitis, retinal detachment, or cataract. Management must
be individualized according to the type of displacement, its cause, and
the presence of any complicating ocular or systemic conditions. For
many patients, optical correction by spectacles or contact lenses can be
provided. Manipulation of the iris diaphragm with mydriatic or miotic
drops may sometimes help improve vision. In selected cases, the best
treatment is surgical removal of the lens. In many children, treatment
of any associated amblyopia must be instituted early. In addition, for
children with ectopia lentis, safety precautions should be taken to prevent injury to the eye.

OTHER DISORDERS OF THE LENS
Microspherophakia

The term microspherophakia refers to a small, round lens that may
occur as an isolated anomaly (probably autosomal recessive) or in association with other ocular abnormalities, such as ectopia lentis, myopia,
or retinal detachment (possibly autosomal dominant). Microspherophakia may also occur in association with various systemic disorders,
including Marfan syndrome, Weill-­Marchesani syndrome, Alport syndrome, mandibulofacial dysostosis, and Klinefelter syndrome.

Anterior Lenticonus

Anterior lenticonus is a rare bilateral condition in which the anterior
capsule of the lens thins, allowing the lens to bulge forward centrally. It
may be accompanied by lens opacities or other eye anomalies and is a
prominent feature of Alport syndrome. The increased curvature of the
central area may cause high myopia. Spontaneous rupture of the anterior capsule may occur, requiring prompt surgical intervention.

Posterior Lenticonus

Posterior lenticonus, which occurs more commonly than anterior lenticonus, is characterized by a circumscribed round or oval bulge of the
posterior lens capsule and cortex, involving the central region of the
lens. In the early stages, by the red reflex test, this may look like an oil
droplet. It occurs in infants and young children and tends to increase
with age. Usually the lens material within and surrounding the capsular bulge eventually becomes opacified. Posterior lenticonus usually

occurs as an isolated ocular anomaly. It is generally unilateral but may
be bilateral. It is believed to be sporadic, although autosomal dominant
and X-­linked inheritance has been suggested in some cases. Infants
or children with posterior lenticonus may require optical correction,
amblyopia treatment, and surgery for progressive cataract.

Disorders of the Uveal
Tract
Scott E. Olitsky and Justin D. Marsh
UVEITIS (IRITIS, CYCLITIS, CHORIORETINITIS)

The uveal tract (the inner vascular coat of the eye, consisting of the
iris, ciliary body, and choroid) (Fig. 669.1) is subject to inflammatory
involvement in numerous systemic diseases, both infectious and noninfectious, and in response to exogenous factors, including trauma and
toxic agents (Table 669.1). Inflammation may affect any one portion
of the uveal tract preferentially or all parts together. Uveitis may be
classified as anterior (iris, ciliary body), intermediate (vitreous-­choroid
locations), posterior (choroid, retina) or panuveitis, with subclassification as infectious, inflammatory, or systemic disease associated and eye
limited.
Iritis may occur alone or in conjunction with inflammation of the
ciliary body as iridocyclitis or in association with pars planitis. Pain,
photophobia, and lacrimation are the characteristic symptoms of acute
anterior uveitis, but the inflammation may develop insidiously without disturbing symptoms. Signs of anterior uveitis include conjunctival hyperemia, particularly in the perilimbal region (ciliary flush), and
cells and protein (“flare”) in the aqueous humor (Figs. 669.2 and 669.3).
Inflammatory deposits on the posterior surface of the cornea (keratic
precipitates) and congestion of the iris may also be seen. More chronic
cases may show degenerative changes of the cornea (band keratopathy),
lenticular opacities (cataract), development of glaucoma, and impairment of vision. The cause of anterior uveitis is often idiopathic; primary
considerations in children are rheumatoid disease, particularly pauciarticular arthritis, Kawasaki disease, postinfectious reactive arthritis
syndrome, tubulointerstitial nephritis (TINU), HLA-­B27 associated
syndromes, and sarcoidosis. Iritis may be secondary to corneal disease,
such as herpetic keratitis or a bacterial or fungal corneal ulcer, or to a
corneal abrasion or foreign body. Traumatic iritis and iridocyclitis are
especially common in children.
Iridocyclitis that occurs in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis deserves special mention. Unlike most forms of anterior uveitis, it
rarely creates pain, photophobia, or conjunctival hyperemia. Loss of
vision may not be noticed until severe and irreversible damage has
occurred. Because of the lack of symptoms and the high incidence of
uveitis in these children, routine periodic screening is necessary. Ophthalmic screening guidelines are based on 3 factors that predispose
children with arthritis to uveitis (Fig. 669.4):
1.	Type of arthritis
2.	Age of onset of arthritis
3.	Antinuclear antibody (ANA) status
Choroiditis, inflammation of the posterior portion of the uveal tract,
invariably also involves the retina; when both are obviously affected,
the condition is termed chorioretinitis. The causes of posterior uveitis
are numerous; the more common are toxoplasmosis, histoplasmosis,
cytomegalovirus, sarcoidosis, syphilis, tuberculosis, and toxocariasis

(Fig. 669.5). Depending on the etiology, the inflammatory signs may
be diffuse or focal. Vitreous reaction often occurs as well. With many
types, the result is atrophic chorioretinal scarring demarcated by pigmentation, often with visual impairment. Secondary complications
include retinal detachment, glaucoma, and phthisis.
Panophthalmitis is inflammation involving all parts of the eye. It is
frequently suppurative, most often as a result of a perforating injury or
of septicemia. It produces severe pain, marked congestion of the eye,
inflammation of the adjacent orbital tissues and eyelids, and loss of
vision. In many cases, the eye is lost despite intensive treatment of the
infection and inflammation. Enucleation of the eye or evisceration of
the orbit may be necessary.
Sympathetic ophthalmia is a rare type of uveal inflammatory response
that affects the uninjured eye after a perforating injury to the other eye. It
may occur weeks, months, or even years after the injury. A hypersensitivity
phenomenon is the most probable cause. Loss of vision in the uninjured
(sympathizing) eye may result. Removal of the injured eye prevents the
development of sympathetic ophthalmia but does not stop the progression of the disease once it has occurred. High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone is the initial treatment of choice. Immune therapy (immune
suppression or modulators) may need to be added to steroids; these agents
include cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cytoxan and
TNF-alpha blocking agents (infliximab, adalimumab).

Treatment

3953

The various forms of intraocular inflammation are treated according
to their underlying systemic causal factors. When infection is proved
or suspected, appropriate systemic antimicrobial or antiviral therapy is
used. In some cases, intravitreal injection is indicated.
Elimination of the intraocular inflammation is important to reduce
the risk of severe, and often permanent, vision loss. Untreated, the
inflammatory process may lead to the development of band keratopathy (calcium deposition in the cornea), cataracts, glaucoma, and irreversible retinal damage. Anterior inflammation may respond well to
topical corticosteroid treatment. Posterior cases often require systemic
therapy. The use of topical and systemic corticosteroids can lead to the
development of glaucoma and cataracts. To reduce the need for topical and systemic corticosteroids, systemic immunosuppression is often
used in patients requiring long-­term treatment. Immunosuppressive
agents include methotrexate, cyclosporine, and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. Multiple agents may be needed in recalcitrant cases.

Noninfectious inflammatory uveitis in adolescents has been treated
with adalimumab, a human antitumor necrosis factor-­α monoclonal
antibody resulting in improved vision, lack of disease progression, and
an ability to wean steroids. Cycloplegic agents, particularly atropine,
are also used to reduce inflammation and to prevent adhesion of the
iris to the lens (posterior synechiae), especially in anterior uveitis.
Extensive posterior synechiae formation can lead to acute angle closure
glaucoma. Other complications are noted in Table 669.2.
Surgery may be required for patients who develop glaucoma because
of the underlying disease process or the need for corticosteroid treatment. Cataract surgery should be delayed until the inflammation has
been under control for a period of time. Cataract surgery in children
with a history of prolonged uveitis can carry significant risk. There is
no universal agreement concerning the use of intraocular lenses in
these patients.
Pars planitis is an uncommon idiopathic form of intermediate uveitis characterized by anterior chamber involvement, anterior vitreous
cells and condensations, and peripheral retinal vasculitis. The average
age of onset is 9 years. It is predominately bilateral and seen more frequently in males. Painless decreased vision is the usual presenting sign.
The prognosis is good when adequate medical treatment is sought early
in the course of the disease.
Masquerade syndromes can sometimes mimic intraocular inflammation. Retinoblastoma, leukemia, retained intraocular foreign body,
juvenile xanthogranuloma, and peripheral retinal detachments may
produce signs similar to those seen in uveitis. These syndromes should
be kept in mind when evaluating a patient with suspected uveitis or if a
patient does not respond as anticipated to appropriate treatment.

Disorders of the Retina
and Vitreous
Scott E. Olitsky and Justin D. Marsh
RETINOPATHY OF PREMATURITY

Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a complex disease of the developing retinal vasculature in infants born prematurely. It may be acute
(early stages) or chronic (late stages). Clinical manifestations range
from mild, usually transient changes of the peripheral retina to severe
progressive vasoproliferation, scarring, and potentially blinding retinal
detachment. ROP includes all stages of the disease and its sequelae.

Pathogenesis

Beginning at 16 weeks of gestation, retinal angiogenesis normally proceeds from the optic disc to the periphery, reaching the outer rim of
the retina (ora serrata) nasally at about 36 weeks and extending temporally by approximately 40 weeks. Injury to this process results in various pathologic and clinical changes. The first observation in the acute
phase is cessation of vasculogenesis. Rather than a gradual transition
from a vascularized to avascular retina, there is an abrupt termination of the vessels marked by a line in the retina. The line may then
grow into a ridge composed of mesenchymal and endothelial cells. Cell
division and differentiation may later resume, and vascularization of
the retina may proceed. Alternatively, there may be progression to an
abnormal proliferation of vessels out of the plane of the retina, into the
vitreous, and over the surface of the retina. Cicatrization and traction
on the retina may follow, leading to retinal detachment.
The risk factors associated with ROP are not fully known, but prematurity and the associated retinal immaturity at birth represent the
major factors. Oxygenation, respiratory distress, apnea, bradycardia,
heart disease, infection, hypercarbia, acidosis, anemia, and the need for
transfusion are thought by some to be contributory factors. Generally,
the lower the gestational age, the lower the birthweight, and the sicker
the infant, the greater the risk for ROP.
The basic pathogenesis of ROP is still unknown. Exposure to the
extrauterine environment, including the necessarily high inspired
oxygen concentrations, produces cellular damage, perhaps mediated
by free radicals. Later in the course of the disease, peripheral hypoxia
develops and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) are produced in the nonvascularized retina. These growth factors stimulate
abnormal vasculogenesis, causing neovascularization to occur. Because
of poor pulmonary function, a state of relative retinal hypoxia occurs.
This causes upregulation of VEGF, which, in susceptible infants, can
cause abnormal fibrovascular growth. This neovascularization may
then lead to scarring and loss of vision.

Classification

The international classification of ROP describes the location, extent,
and severity of the disease. To delineate location, the retina is divided
into three concentric zones centered on the optic disc (Fig. 670.1).
Zone I, the posterior or inner zone, extends twice the disc-­macular
distance, or 30 degrees in all directions from the optic disc. Zone II,
the middle zone, extends from the outer edge of zone I to the ora serrata nasally and to the anatomic equator temporally. Zone III, the outer
zone, is the residual crescent that extends from the outer border of zone
II to the ora serrata temporally. The extent of involvement is described
by the number of circumferential clock hours involved.
The phases and severity of the disease process are classified into five
stages. Stage 1 is characterized by a demarcation line that separates vascularized from avascular retina. This line lies within the plane of the
retina and appears relatively flat and white. Often noted is abnormal

3955

branching or arcading of the retinal vessels leading into the line. Stage
2 is characterized by a ridge; the demarcation line has grown, acquiring height, width, and volume and extending up and out of the plane
of the retina. Stage 3 is characterized by the presence of a ridge and the
development of extraretinal fibrovascular tissue (Fig. 670.2A). Stage 4
is characterized by subtotal retinal detachment caused by traction from
the proliferating tissue in the vitreous or on the retina. Stage 4 is subdivided into two phases: (1) subtotal retinal detachment not involving
the macula and (2) subtotal retinal detachment involving the macula.
Stage 5 is total retinal detachment.
When signs of posterior retinal vascular changes accompany the
active stages of ROP, the term plus disease is used (see Fig. 670.2B and
C). Patients reaching the point of dilation and tortuosity of the retinal
vessels also frequently demonstrate the associated findings of engorgement of the iris, pupillary rigidity, and vitreous haze.
The Early Treatment for Retinopathy of Prematurity Cooperative
has described types 1 and 2 ROP as follows:
Type 1 ROP
• Zone I: Any stage with plus
• Zone I: Stage 3 without plus
• Zone II: Stage 2 to three with plus type 2 ROP
• Zone I: Stage 1 to two without plus
• Zone II: Stage 3 without plus

Clinical Manifestations and Prognosis

In more than 90% of at-­risk infants, the course is one of spontaneous
arrest and regression, with little or no residual effects or visual disability. Fewer than 10% of infants have progression toward severe disease,
with significant extraretinal vasoproliferation, cicatrization, detachment of the retina, and impairment of vision.
Some children with arrested or regressed ROP are left with demarcation lines, undervascularization of the peripheral retina, or abnormal
branching, tortuosity, or straightening of the retinal vessels. Some are
left with retinal pigmentary changes, dragging of the retina, ectopia of
the macula, retinal folds, or retinal breaks. Others proceed to total retinal detachment, which commonly assumes a funnel-­like configuration.
The clinical picture is often that of a retrolental membrane, producing
leukocoria (a white reflex in the pupil). Some patients develop cataract,
glaucoma, and signs of inflammation. The end stage is often a painful
blind eye or a degenerated phthisical eye. The spectrum of ROP also
includes myopia, which is often progressive and of significant degree in
infancy. The incidence of anisometropia, strabismus, amblyopia, and
nystagmus may also be increased.

Diagnosis

Systematic serial screening ophthalmologic examinations of infants at
risk are recommended. Infants with a birthweight of less than 1,500
g or gestational age of 32 weeks or less and selected infants with a
birthweight between 1,500 and 2,000 g or gestational age of more than
32 weeks with an unstable clinical course, including those requiring
cardiorespiratory support and who are believed by their pediatrician or neonatologist to be at high risk, should have retinal screening
examinations. The timing of the initial screening exam is based on the
infant’s age. Table 670.1 was developed from an evidence-­based analysis of the Multicenter Trial of Cryotherapy for ROP. The examination
can be stressful to fragile preterm infants, and the dilating drops can
have untoward side effects. Infants must be carefully monitored during
and after the examination. Some neonatologists and ophthalmologists
advocate the use of topical tetracaine and/or oral sucrose to reduce the
discomfort and stress to the infant. Follow-­up is based on the initial
findings and risk factors but is usually 2 weeks or less.

Treatment

In selected cases, laser photocoagulation of the avascular retina reduces
the more severe complications of progressive ROP (Table 670.2).
Advances in vitreoretinal surgical techniques have had limited success in reattaching the retina in infants with total retinal detachment
(stage 5 ROP), but the visual results are often disappointing. The Early
Treatment for Retinopathy of Prematurity Cooperative study did find

improving plus disease and extraretinal fibrovascular tissue (stage
3 disease) within days of treatment. Theoretical advantages of these
agents include not only the potential for improved peripheral retinal
vascularization after treatment but also an apparent reduction in myopia later in childhood. Because the effects of intravitreal VEGF antagonists are temporary, neonates treated in this manner must be followed
closely, often for months, after treatment to ensure additional therapy
is not warranted.

Prevention

Prevention of ROP ultimately depends on the prevention of premature
birth and its attendant problems (see Chapters 116 and 119.2). However, a number of other potential factors have been studied to decrease
the occurrence of ROP in these premature infants. Ambient light had
been considered by some to be a potential agent that could hopefully be
manipulated. The LIGHT-­ROP study definitively found that ambient
light reduction had no impact on ROP. The association between ROP
and oxygen saturation has been studied for decades. Recent research
has focused on maintaining oxygen saturation levels for severely premature infants at levels sufficiently low to minimize the risk of ROP
and sufficiently high to optimize survival.

PERSISTENT FETAL VASCULATURE

Persistent fetal vasculature (PFV; formerly called persistent hyperplastic
primary vitreous) includes a spectrum of manifestations caused by the
persistence of various portions of the fetal hyaloid vascular system and
associated fibrovascular tissue.

Pathogenesis

During development of the eye, the hyaloid artery extends from the
optic disc to the posterior aspect of the lens; it sends branches into the
vitreous and ramifies to form the posterior portion of the vascular capsule of the lens. The posterior portion of the hyaloid system normally
regresses by the seventh fetal month and the anterior portion by the
eighth fetal month. Small remnants of the system, such as a tuft of tissue at the disc (Bergmeister papilla) or a tag of tissue on the posterior
capsule of the lens (Mittendorf dot), are common findings in healthy
persons. More extensive remnants and associated complications constitute PFV. Two major forms are described: anterior PFV and posterior PFV. Variability is great, and mixed or intermediate forms occur.

Clinical Manifestations

The usual clinical feature of anterior PFV is the presence of a vascularized plaque of tissue on the back surface of the lens in an eye that
is microphthalmic or slightly smaller than normal. The condition is
usually unilateral and may occur in infants with no other abnormalities and no history of prematurity. The fibrovascular tissue tends to
undergo gradual contracture. The ciliary processes become elongated,
and the anterior chamber may become shallow. The lens is usually
smaller than normal and may be clear, but it often becomes cataractous
and may swell or absorb fluid. Large or anomalous vessels of the iris
may be present. The anterior chamber angle may have abnormalities.
In time, the cornea may become cloudy.
Anterior PFV is usually noted in the first weeks or months of life.
The most frequent presenting signs are leukocoria (white pupillary
reflex), strabismus, and nystagmus. The course is usually progressive,
and the outcome is poor. Major complications are spontaneous intraocular hemorrhage, swelling of the lens caused by rupture of the posterior capsule, and glaucoma. The eye may eventually deteriorate. The
spectrum of posterior PFV includes fibroglial veils around the disc and
macula, vitreous membranes and stalks containing hyaloid artery remnants projecting from the disc, and meridional retinal folds. Traction
detachment of the retina may occur. Vision may be impaired, but the
eye is usually retained.

Treatment

Surgery is performed to prevent complications, to preserve the eye
and a reasonably good cosmetic appearance, and, in some cases, to salvage vision. Surgical treatment usually involves aspirating the lens and

3957

excising the abnormal tissue. If useful vision is to be attained, refractive correction and aggressive amblyopia therapy are required. In some
cases, the affected eye is enucleated because distinguishing between
this white mass and retinoblastoma can be difficult. Ultrasonography
and CT are valuable diagnostic aids.

RETINOBLASTOMA

Retinoblastoma (Fig. 670.3) is the most common primary malignant
intraocular tumor of childhood. It occurs in approximately 1/15,000
live births; 250-­300 new cases are diagnosed in the United States annually. Hereditary and nonhereditary patterns of transmission occur;
there is no predilection for gender or race. The hereditary form occurs
earlier and is usually bilateral and multifocal, whereas the nonhereditary form is generally unilateral and unifocal. Fifteen percent of unilateral cases are hereditary. Bilateral cases often present earlier than
unilateral cases. Unilateral tumors are often large by the time they are
discovered. The average age at diagnosis is 15 months for bilateral cases
compared with 27 months for unilateral cases. It is unusual for a child
to present with a retinoblastoma after 3 years of age. Rarely, the tumor
is discovered at birth, during adolescence, or even in early adulthood.

Clinical Manifestations

The clinical manifestations of retinoblastoma vary depending on the
stage at which the tumor is detected. The initial sign in the majority
of patients is a white pupillary reflex (leukocoria). Leukocoria results
because of the reflection of light off the white tumor. The second most
frequent initial sign of retinoblastoma is strabismus. Less frequent presenting signs include pseudohypopyon (tumor cells layered inferiorly
in front of the iris) caused by tumor seeding in the anterior chamber of
the eye, hyphema (blood layered in front of the iris) secondary to iris
neovascularization, vitreous hemorrhage, and signs of orbital cellulitis.
On examination, the tumor appears as a white mass, sometimes small
and relatively flat, sometimes large and protuberant. It may appear
nodular. Vitreous haze or tumor seeding may be evident.
The retinoblastoma gene is a recessive suppressor gene located on
chromosome 13 at the 13q14 region. Because of the hereditary nature
of retinoblastoma, family members of affected children should undergo
a complete ophthalmologic examination and genetic counseling. Newborn siblings and children of affected patients should be referred to an
ophthalmologist shortly after birth, when the peripheral retina can be
evaluated without the need for an examination under anesthesia.

Diagnosis

Retinoblastoma is diagnosed by direct observation by an experienced
ophthalmologist. Ancillary testing such as CT or ultrasonography may
help to confirm the diagnosis and demonstrate calcification within the
mass. MRI may better detect the presence of an associated pineoblastoma (trilateral retinoblastoma). A definitive diagnosis occasionally
cannot be made, and removal of the eye must be considered to avoid
the possibility of lethal metastasis of the tumor. Because a biopsy can
lead to spread of the tumor, histologic confirmation before enucleation
is not possible in most cases. Therefore removal of a blind eye in which
the diagnosis of retinoblastoma is likely may be appropriate.

Treatment

Therapy varies, depending on the size and location of the tumor as well
as whether it is unilateral or bilateral. Advanced tumors may be treated
by enucleation. Other treatment modalities include the use of external
beam irradiation, radiation plaque therapy, laser or cryotherapy, and
chemoreduction (systemic chemotherapy) followed by local therapies
(i.e., laser therapy, cryotherapy, and brachytherapy). During the last
decade, there has been a dramatic shift in the treatment of retinoblastomas. Intraarterial chemotherapy involves delivery of chemotherapeutic
agents via the ophthalmic artery and has dramatically reduced the need

treated with radiation. Other malignancies include lung, brain, soft tissue, and skin.
The prognosis for children with retinoblastoma depends on the size
and extension of the tumor. When confined to the eye, most tumors
can be cured. The prognosis for long-­term survival is poor when the
tumor has extended into the orbit or along the optic nerve.

INHERITED RETINAL DYSTROPHIES

Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) represent a wide spectrum of disorders (∼280 affected genes) causing loss of photoreceptors and involving various locations (peripheral vs. macular or central) (Fig. 670.4)
and affecting ∼1/3,000 people. Most cases are monogenetic or isolated
and nonsyndromic (∼75%). Inheritance may be autosomal recessive or
dominant, X-­linked, mitochondrial, uniparental disomy, or digenic.
There is significant genetic heterogenicity and overlap of the involved
genes (Fig. 670.5). The IRDs are classified as retinitis pigmentosa,
macular dystrophies, cone, or cone-­rod dystrophies, syndromic (Usher
syndrome with deafness), and the Leber congenital amaurosis disorders (>20 genes).

Retinitis Pigmentosa

This progressive peripheral retinal degeneration is the most common IRD and is characterized by pigmentary changes, arteriolar
attenuation, usually some degree of optic atrophy, and progressive

impairment of visual function. Dispersion and aggregation of the
retinal pigment produce various ophthalmoscopically visible changes
ranging from granularity or mottling of the retinal pigment pattern
to distinctive focal pigment aggregates with the configuration of bone
spicules (Fig. 670.6). Other ocular findings include subcapsular cataract, glaucoma, and keratoconus.
Impairment of night vision (nyctalopia) or dark adaptation is often
the first clinical manifestation. Progressive loss of peripheral vision
(tunnel vision), often in the form of an expanding ring scotoma or
concentric contraction of the field, is usual. There may also be loss of
central vision. Retinal function, as measured by electroretinography
(ERG), is characteristically reduced. The disorder may be autosomal
recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-­linked with ∼70 affected genes
(see Fig. 670.5). Children with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa are more likely to become symptomatic at an earlier age (median
age 10.7 years). Those with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa
are more likely to present in their 20s.
Another form of nonsyndromic IRD is Leber congenital retinal
amaurosis (LCA), in which the retinal changes tend to be pleomorphic,
with various degrees of pigment disorder, arteriolar attenuation, and
optic atrophy. The incidence is approximately 1/81,000 births. Patients
develop poor vision, nystagmus, poor pupillary response to light, and a
behavioral pattern of eye rubbing. There are pathogenic variants in ∼20
different genes producing this early (infancy) onset autosomal recessive severe retinal degenerative disease (see Fig. 670.5). Ten percent
have pathogenic variants in the LRAT or RPE65 genes, involved in retinoid metabolism. Although the retina may initially appear normal during infancy, the child typically shows evidence of visual impairment,
nystagmus, and poor pupillary reaction soon after birth. ERG findings
are abnormal early and confirm the diagnosis. Visual loss can be profound and may progress with age.
Gene replacement therapy via subretinal injections shows promise for RPE65-­related IRDs, including those phenotypes of retinitis
pigmentosa, Leber congenital amaurosis, and other IRD with this
pathologic gene variant. Individuals who received subretinal injection
of vector genomes of voretigene neparvovec improved in their ability to navigate a dimly lit course when compared with controls, with

outcomes measured at 1 year. Similar gene replacement studies have
been conducted or are being conducted for other retinal dystrophies,
including choroideremia, Stargardt disease, cone-­rod dystrophy, and
X-­linked retinoschisis.
Usher syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder, is the most common cause of syndromic IRD and sensorineural deafness (incidence,
1/25,000). Type 1 Usher syndrome presents at birth with profound
hearing loss and poor balance; vision loss progresses more slowly and
begins during adolescence. Patients with type 3 disease have normal
hearing at birth but develop hearing loss and night blindness around
puberty. To date, 11 genetic loci have been located (5 for type 1, 3 for
type 2; 1 for type 3).
A similar clinical picture may occur in the setting of secondary
pigmentary retinal degenerations, which must be differentiated from
retinitis pigmentosa, when associated with a wide variety of metabolic
diseases, neurodegenerative processes, and multifaceted syndromes.
Examples include the progressive retinal changes of the mucopolysaccharidoses (particularly Hurler, Hunter, Scheie, and Sanfilippo syndromes; see Chapter 109) and certain of the late-­onset gangliosidoses
(Batten-­Mayou, Spielmeyer-­Vogt, and Jansky-­Bielschowsky diseases;
see Chapters 106.4 and 639.2), the progressive retinal degeneration
associated with progressive external ophthalmoplegia (Kearns-­Sayre
syndrome; see Chapter 638.2), and the retinitis pigmentosa–like
changes in the Laurence-­Moon and Bardet-­Biedl syndromes. The
retinal manifestations of abetalipoproteinemia (Bassen-­Kornzweig
syndrome; see Chapter 106) and Refsum disease (see Chapter 106.2)
are also similar to those found in retinitis pigmentosa. The diagnosis
of the latter two disorders in a patient with presumed retinitis pigmentosa is important because treatment is possible. There is also an
association of retinitis pigmentosa and congenital hearing loss, as in
Usher syndrome.

STARGARDT DISEASE (FUNDUS FLAVIMACULATUS)

This autosomal recessive IRD/macular dystrophy is characterized by
slowly progressive bilateral macular degeneration and impairment of
vision. It usually appears at 8-­14 years of age, and affected children are
often initially misdiagnosed as having functional visual loss. The foveal
reflex becomes obtunded or appears grayish, pigment spots develop
in the macular area, and macular depigmentation and chorioretinal
atrophy eventually occur. Macular hemorrhages may also develop.
Some patients also have white or yellow spots beyond the macula or
pigmentary changes in the periphery; the term fundus flavimaculatus is
commonly used for this condition. It is now recognized that Stargardt
disease and fundus flavimaculatus represent different entities on the
spectrum of the same disease. Central visual acuity is reduced, often
to 20/200, but total loss of vision does not occur. ERG findings vary.
The condition is not associated with central nervous system abnormalities and is to be differentiated from the macular changes of many

progressive metabolic neurodegenerative diseases. The most common
(95%) genetic pathogenic variant (autosomal recessive) responsible
for Stargardt macular dystrophy involves the ABCA4 gene. Pathologic
variants in ELOVL4 are less common and are inherited as an autosomal
dominant trait. Gene replacement therapy is being investigated for this
condition.

BEST VITELLIFORM DEGENERATION

This macular dystrophy is characterized by a distinctive yellow or
orange discoid subretinal lesion in the macula, resembling the intact
yolk of a fried egg. Diagnosis is usually made at 3-­15 years of age, with
a mean age of presentation of 6 years. Vision is usually normal at this
stage. The condition may be progressive; the yolklike lesion may eventually degenerate (“scramble”) and result in pigmentation, chorioretinal atrophy, and vision impairment. The condition is usually bilateral.
There is no association with systemic abnormalities. Inheritance is
usually autosomal dominant. The vitelliform macular dystrophy gene
(VMD2) has been identified, and DNA testing is available. In vitelliform macular degeneration, the ERG response is normal. Electro-­
oculographic findings are abnormal in affected patients and carriers,
and this test is useful in diagnosis and genetic counseling.

CHERRY-­RED SPOT

Fig. 670.7 Cherry-­red spot seen in a case of Tay-­Sachs disease. Be-

cause the parafoveal area has many retinal ganglion cells and the fovea
has none, the fovea retains its orange-­red color but is surrounded by a
retina that is whitish. This produces the cherry-­red spot in the macula.
(From Cheng KP, Biglan AW. Ophthalmology. In Zitelli BJ, McIntire SC,
Nowald AJ, eds. Zitelli and Davis’ Atlas of Pediatric Physical Diagnosis,
6th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders, 2012. Fig. 19.102.)

Because of the special histologic features of the macula, certain pathologic processes affecting the retina produce an ophthalmoscopically
visible sign referred to as a cherry-­red spot, a bright to dull red spot
at the center of the macula surrounded and accentuated by a grayish-­
white or yellowish halo (Fig. 670.7). The halo is a result of a loss of
transparency of the retinal ganglion cell layer secondary to edema,
lipid accumulation, or both. Because ganglion cells are not present in
the fovea, the retina surrounding the fovea is opacified but the fovea
transmits the normal underlying choroidal color (red), accounting for
the presence of the cherry-­red spot. A cherry-­red spot typically occurs
in certain sphingolipidoses, principally in Tay-­Sachs disease (GM2 type
1), in the Sandhoff variant (GM2 type 2), and in generalized gangliosidosis (GM1 type 1). Similar but less distinctive macular changes occur
in some cases of metachromatic leukodystrophy (sulfatide lipidosis), in
some forms of neuronopathic Niemann-­Pick disease, in galactosialidosis, and in certain mucolipidoses. The cherry-­red spot that characteristically occurs as a result of retinal ischemia secondary to vasospasm,
ocular contusion, or occlusion of the central retinal artery must be differentiated from the cherry-­red spot of neurodegenerative disease (see
Chapters 106.4 and 639).

PHAKOMATOSIS

See also Chapter 636.
These are the herald lesions of the hamartomatous disorders. Tuberous sclerosis, the distinctive ocular lesion is a refractile, yellowish,
multinodular cystic lesion arising from the disc or retina; the appearance of this typical lesion is often compared with that of an unripe
mulberry (Fig. 670.8). Equally characteristic and more common in
tuberous sclerosis are flatter, yellow to whitish retinal lesions that vary
in size from minute dots to large lesions approaching the size of the
disc. These lesions are benign astrocytic proliferations. Rarely, similar
retinal phakomas occur in neurofibromatosis. In von Hippel-­Lindau
disease (angiomatosis of the retina and cerebellum), the distinctive
fundus lesion is a hemangioblastoma; this vascular lesion usually
appears as a reddish globular mass with large, paired arteries and veins
passing to and from the lesion. In Sturge-­Weber syndrome (encephalofacial angiomatosis), the fundus abnormality is a choroidal hemangioma; the hemangioma may impart a dark color to the affected area
of the fundus, but the lesion is best seen with fluorescein angiography.

is characterized by splitting of the retina into inner and outer layers.
The usual ophthalmoscopic finding in affected males is an elevation
of the inner layer of the retina, most commonly in the inferotemporal
quadrant of the fundus, often with round or oval holes visible in the
inner layer. Schisis of the fovea is virtually pathognomonic and is found
in almost 100% of patients. Ophthalmoscopically, this appears in early
stages as small, fine striae in the internal limiting membrane. These
striae radiate outward in a petaloid or spoke-­wheel configuration. In
some cases, frank retinal detachment or vitreous hemorrhage occurs.
Vision impairment varies from mild to severe; visual acuity may
worsen with age, but good vision is often retained. Carrier females are
asymptomatic, but linkage studies may be useful to help detect carriers.
In some cases, treatment with a topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor
may improve visual acuity.

RETINOSCHISIS

RETINAL DETACHMENT

Congenital hereditary retinoschisis, also referred to as juvenile X-­linked
retinoschisis, is a bilateral vitreoretinal dystrophy that has a bimodal
age of presentation. The first group presents with strabismus and nystagmus at a mean age of 1.5-­2 years and is the most severely affected.
The second group presents at 6-­7 years with poor vision. Retinoschisis

A retinal detachment is a separation of the outer layers of the retina from
the underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). During embryogenesis, the retina and RPE are initially separated. During ocular development, they join together and are held in apposition to each other by
various physiologic mechanisms. Pathologic events leading to a retinal

Chapter 670 u Disorders of the Retina and Vitreous
detachment return the retina–RPE to its former separated state. The
detachment can occur as a congenital anomaly but more commonly
arises secondary to other ocular abnormalities or trauma. Three types
of detachment are described, and each may occur in children. Rhegmatogenous detachments result from a break in the retina that allows
fluid to enter the subretinal space. In children, these are usually a result
of trauma (such as child abuse) but may occur secondary to myopia or
ROP or after surgery for congenital cataract. Tractional retinal detachments result when vitreoretinal membranes pull on the retina. They
can occur in diabetes, sickle cell disease, and ROP. Exudative retinal
detachments result when exudation exceeds absorption. This can be
seen in Coats disease, retinoblastoma, and ocular inflammation.
The presenting sign of retinal detachment in an infant or child may
be loss of vision, secondary strabismus or nystagmus, or leukocoria
(white pupillary reflex). In addition to direct examination of the eye,
special diagnostic studies such as ultrasonography and neuroimaging
(CT, MRI) may be necessary to establish the cause of the detachment
and the appropriate treatment. Prompt treatment is essential if vision
is to be salvaged.

Fig. 670.9 Coats disease with massive retinal exudation.

COATS DISEASE

This idiopathic, nonfamilial exudative retinopathy is characterized
by telangiectasia of retinal vessels with leakage of plasma to form
intraretinal and subretinal exudates and by retinal hemorrhages and
detachment (Fig. 670.9). The condition is usually unilateral. It predominantly affects previously healthy males, usually appearing in the
first decade. The most frequent presenting signs are blurring of vision,
leukocoria, and strabismus. Rubeosis of the iris, glaucoma, and cataract
may develop. The differential diagnosis includes retinoblastoma, ROP,
Norrie disease, angiomatosis, chorioretinitis (see Table 669.1), systemic vasculitis, and Coats plus syndrome (leukodystrophy, osteopenia, anemia, retinitis) due to pathogenic variants in CTC1 (autosomal
recessive). Treatment with photocoagulation, cryotherapy, or VEGF
inhibitors may be helpful.

FAMILIAL EXUDATIVE VITREORETINOPATHY

This progressive genetic retinal vascular disorder has clinical and angiographic findings that suggest an aberration of vascular development.
Avascularity of the peripheral temporal retina is a significant finding
in most cases, with abrupt cessation of the retinal capillary network
in the region of the equator. The avascular zone often has a wedge-­or
V-­shaped pattern in the temporal meridian. Glial proliferation or well-­
marked retinochoroidal atrophy may be found in the avascular zone.
Excessive branching of retinal arteries and veins, dilation of the capillaries, arteriovenous shunt formation, neovascularization, and leakage
from retinal vessels of the farthest vascularized retina occur. Vitreoretinal adhesions are usually present at the peripheral margin of the
vascularized retina. Traction, retinal dragging and temporal displacement of the macula, falciform retinal folds, and retinal detachment are
common. Intraretinal or subretinal exudation, retinal hemorrhage,
and recurrent vitreous hemorrhages may develop. Patients may also
develop cataracts and glaucoma. Vision impairment of varying severity
occurs. The condition is usually bilateral. Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) is usually an autosomal dominant condition (FZD4
or LRP5) with incomplete penetrance. Autosomal recessive (LRP5)
and X-­linked (CNDP) have also been reported. Asymptomatic family
members often display a zone of avascular peripheral retina.
The findings in FEVR may resemble those of ROP in the cicatricial stages, but unlike ROP, the neovascularization of FEVR seems to
develop years after birth, and most patients with FEVR have no history
of prematurity, oxygen therapy, prenatal or postnatal injury or infection, or developmental abnormalities. FEVR is also to be differentiated
from Coats disease, angiomatosis of the retina, peripheral uveitis, and
other disorders of the posterior segment.

HYPERTENSIVE RETINOPATHY

In the early stages of hypertension, no retinal changes may be observable. Generalized constriction and irregular narrowing of the arterioles
are usually the first signs in the fundus. Other alterations include retinal

arterioles cross venules. (From Yanoff M, Duker JS, eds. Ophthalmology. Elsevier, 2009.)

edema, flame-­shaped hemorrhages, cotton-­wool spots (retinal nerve
fiber layer infarcts), and papilledema (Fig. 670.10). These changes are
reversible if the hypertension can be controlled in the early stages, but
in long-­standing hypertension, irreversible changes may occur. Thickening of the vessel wall may produce a silver-­or copper-­wire appearance. Hypertensive retinal changes in a child should alert the physician
to renal disease, pheochromocytoma, collagen disease, and cardiovascular disorders, particularly coarctation of the aorta.

DIABETIC RETINOPATHY

The retinal changes of diabetes mellitus are classified as nonproliferative or proliferative. Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy is characterized by retinal microaneurysms, venous dilation, retinal hemorrhages,
and exudates. The microaneurysms appear as tiny red dots. The hemorrhages may be of both the dot and blot type, representing deep intraretinal bleeding, and the splinter or flame-­shaped type, involving the
superficial nerve fiber layer. The exudates tend to be deep and to appear
waxy. There may also be superficial nerve fiber infarcts called cytoid
bodies or cotton-­wool spots, as well as retinal edema. These signs may
wax and wane. They are seen primarily in the posterior pole, around
the disc and macula, or well within the range of direct ophthalmoscopy.
Involvement of the macula may lead to decreased vision.
Proliferative retinopathy, the more serious form, is characterized
by neovascularization and proliferation of fibrovascular tissue on the

retina, extending into the vitreous. Neovascularization may occur
on the optic disc, elsewhere on the retina, or on the iris and in the
anterior chamber angle (or rubeosis irides) (Fig. 670.11). Traction on
these new vessels leads to hemorrhage and, eventually, scarring. The
vision-­threatening complications of proliferative diabetic retinopathy
are retinal and vitreous hemorrhages, cicatrization, traction, and retinal detachment. Neovascularization of the iris may lead to secondary
glaucoma if not treated promptly.
Diabetic retinopathy involves the alteration and nonperfusion of retinal capillaries, retinal ischemia, and neovascularization, but its pathogenesis is not yet completely understood, either in terms of location of
the primary pathogenetic mechanism (retinal vessels vs surrounding
neuronal or glial tissue) or the specific biochemical factors involved.
The better the degree of long-­term metabolic control, the lower the risk
of diabetic retinopathy.
The prevalence and course of retinopathy relate to a patient’s age and
to disease duration. Detectable microvascular changes are rare in prepubertal children, with the prevalence of retinopathy increasing significantly after puberty, especially after the age of 15 years. The incidence
of retinopathy is low during the first 5 years of disease and increases
progressively thereafter, with the incidence of proliferative retinopathy
becoming substantial after 10 years and with increased risk of visual
impairment after 15 years or more.
Ophthalmic examination guidelines have been proposed by the
American Academy of Pediatrics. An initial exam is recommended at
age 9 years if the diabetes is poorly controlled. If the diabetes is well
controlled, an initial exam 3 years after puberty with annual follow-­up
is recommended.
In addition to retinopathy, patients with juvenile-­onset diabetes may
develop optic neuropathy, characterized by swelling of the disc and
blurring of vision. Patients with diabetes may also develop cataracts,
even at an early age, sometimes with rapid progression.

Treatment

Macular edema is the leading cause of visual loss in diabetic persons.
Photocoagulation may be used to decrease the risk of continued vision
loss in patients with macular edema.
Proliferative retinopathy causes the most severe vision loss and
can lead to total loss of vision and even loss of the eye. Patients who
have proliferative disease and who display certain high-­risk characteristics should undergo panretinal photocoagulation to preserve
their central vision. Neovascularization of the iris is also treated
with panretinal photocoagulation to stop the development of neovascular glaucoma.

Vitrectomy and other intraocular surgery may be necessary in
patients with nonresolving vitreous hemorrhage or traction retinal detachment. The value of technologic advances, such as insulin
infusion pumps and pancreatic transplants, in preventing ocular
complications is under investigation (see Chapter 629).

SUBACUTE BACTERIAL ENDOCARDITIS

At some time during the disease, retinopathy is present in approximately 40% of cases of subacute bacterial endocarditis (see Chapter
486). The lesions include hemorrhages, hemorrhages with white centers (Roth spots), papilledema, and, rarely, embolic occlusion of the
central retinal artery (Fig. 670.12).

BLOOD DISORDERS

In primary and secondary anemias, retinopathy in the form of hemorrhages and cotton-­wool patches may occur. Vision can be affected
if hemorrhage occurs in the macular area. The hemorrhages may be
light and feathery or dense and preretinal. In polycythemia vera, the
retinal veins are dark, dilated, and tortuous. Retinal hemorrhages,
retinal edema, and papilledema may be observed. In leukemia, the
veins are characteristically dilated, with sausage-­shaped constrictions; hemorrhages, particularly white-­centered hemorrhages and
exudates, are common during the acute stage. In the sickling disorders, fundus changes include vascular tortuosity, arterial and venous
occlusions, “salmon patches,” refractile deposits, pigmented lesions,
arteriolar-­venous anastomoses, and neovascularization (with “sea-­
fan” formations), sometimes leading to vitreous hemorrhage and
retinal detachment. Individuals with sickle cell hemoglobin C and
sickle cell hemoglobin β-­thalassemia hemoglobinopathies are at a
higher risk of the development of retinopathy than are those with
homozygous hemoglobin S disease. It is thought that the more anemic state of those patients with homozygous hemoglobin S disease
offers protection from vascular occlusions in the retina.

TRAUMA-­RELATED RETINOPATHY

Retinal changes may occur in patients who suffer trauma to other
parts of the body. The occurrence of retinal hemorrhages in infants
who have been physically abused is well documented (Fig. 670.13;
see Chapter 17). Retinal, subretinal, subhyaloid, and vitreous
hemorrhages have been described in infants and young children
with inflicted neurotrauma. Often there are no signs of direct
trauma to the eye, periocular region, or head. Such cases may result
from violent shaking of an infant, and permanent retinal damage
may result.

hemorrhages are also seen with leukemia and diabetes. The small white
scars are probably the residua of previous episodes. (From Goldman L,

punched-­out chorioretinal defects or anomalous pigmentation of
the fundus in the line of the embryonic fissure. Colobomas may
occur in one or both eyes. A visual field defect usually corresponds
to the chorioretinal defect. Visual acuity may be impaired, particularly if the defect involves the disc or macula.
Fundus colobomas may occur in isolation as sporadic defects
or as an inherited condition. Isolated colobomatous anomalies are
commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with highly
variable penetrance and expressivity. Family members of affected
patients should receive appropriate genetic counseling. Colobomas
may also be associated with such abnormalities as microphthalmia,
glioneuroma of the eye, cyclopia, or encephalocele. They occur in
children with various chromosomal disorders, including trisomies
13 and 18, triploidy, cat-­eye syndrome, and 4p−. Ocular colobomas
also occur in many multisystem disorders, including the CHARGE
(C, coloboma; H, heart disease; A, atresia choanae; R, retarded
growth, and development and/or central nervous system anomalies; G, genetic anomalies and/or hypogonadism; E, ear anomalies
and/or deafness) association; Joubert, Aicardi, Meckel, Warburg,
and Rubinstein-­Taybi syndromes; linear sebaceous nevus; Goldenhar and Lenz microphthalmia syndromes; and Goltz focal dermal
hypoplasia.

In patients with severe head or chest compressive trauma, a traumatic retinal angiopathy known as Purtscher retinopathy may
occur. This is characterized by retinal hemorrhage, cotton-­wool
spots, possible disc swelling, and decreased vision. The pathogenesis is unclear, but there is evidence of arteriolar obstruction in this
condition. A Purtscher-­like fundus picture may also occur in several nontraumatic settings, such as acute pancreatitis, lupus erythematosus, and childbirth. Laser pointers may produce vision loss
with varying findings depending on the retinal area exposed to the
nonionizing radiation.

MYELINATED NERVE FIBERS

Myelination of the optic nerve fibers normally terminates at the
level of the disc, but in some individuals, ectopic myelination
extends to nerve fibers of the retina. The condition is most commonly seen adjacent to the disc, although more peripheral areas
of the retina may be involved. The characteristic ophthalmoscopic
picture is a focal white patch with a feathered edge or brushstroke
appearance. Because the macula is generally unaffected, the visual
prognosis is good. A relative or absolute visual field defect corresponding to areas of ectopic myelination is usually the only associated ocular abnormality. Extensive unilateral involvement, however,
is associated with ipsilateral myopia, amblyopia, and strabismus.
If unilateral high myopia and amblyopia are present, appropriate
optical correction and occlusion therapy should be instituted. For
unknown reasons, the disorder is more commonly encountered in
patients with craniofacial dysostosis, oxycephaly, neurofibromatosis, and Down syndrome.

CHORIORETINAL COLOBOMA

The term coloboma describes a defect such as a gap, notch, fissure,
or hole (see Chapter 662). The typical fundus coloboma is a result
of malclosure of the embryonic fissure, which leaves a gap in the
retina, RPE, and choroid, thus baring the underlying sclera. The
defect may be extensive, involving the optic nerve, ciliary body, and
iris and even the lens, or it may be localized to one or more portions
of the fissure. The usual appearance is of a well-­circumscribed,
wedge-­shaped white area extending inferonasally below the disc,
sometimes involving or engulfing the disc. In some cases, there is
ectasia or cyst formation in the area of the defect. Less extensive
colobomatous defects may appear as only single or multiple focal

This rare congenital anomaly of unknown etiology is typically unilateral. The optic nerve, retinal ganglion cells, and retinal blood vessels
are absent. A vestigial dural sheath usually connects with the sclera in
a normal position, but no neural tissue is present within this sheath.
Optic nerve aplasia typically occurs sporadically in an otherwise
healthy person.

OPTIC NERVE HYPOPLASIA

Hypoplasia of the optic nerve is a nonprogressive, idiopathic condition
characterized by a subnormal number of optic nerve axons with normal mesodermal elements and glial supporting tissue. In typical cases,
the nerve head is small and pale, with a pale or pigmented peripapillary
halo or double ring sign (Fig. 671.1).
This anomaly is associated with defects of vision and of visual fields
of varying severity, ranging from blindness to normal or near-­normal
vision. It may be associated with systemic anomalies that most commonly involve the central nervous system (CNS). CNS defects such as
hydranencephaly or anencephaly or more focal lesions compatible with
continued development may accompany optic nerve hypoplasia, but
unilateral or bilateral optic nerve hypoplasia may be found without any
concomitant defects.
Optic nerve hypoplasia is a principal feature of septo-­optic
dysplasia (SOD), a developmental disorder characterized by the
association of anomalies of the midline structures of the brain

MORNING GLORY DISC ANOMALY
with hypoplasia of the optic nerves, optic chiasm, and optic tracts;
typically noted are agenesis of the septum pellucidum, partial or
complete agenesis of the corpus callosum, and malformation
of the fornix, with a large chiasmatic cistern. Patients may have
hypothalamic abnormalities and endocrine defects ranging from
panhypopituitarism to isolated deficiency of growth hormone,
hypothyroidism, or diabetes insipidus. Neonatal hypoglycemia and
seizures are important presenting signs in affected infants. In some
patients with SOD, pathologic variants in HESX1, SOX2, SOX3,
OTX2, and PROKR2 have been identified.
MRI is preferred for evaluating CNS abnormalities in patients
with optic nerve hypoplasia. During MRI, special attention should be
directed to the pituitary infundibulum, where ectopia of the posterior
pituitary may be found. Posterior pituitary ectopia appears on MRI as
an absence of the pituitary infundibulum with an abnormal bright spot
at the upper infundibulum area. This abnormality is present in approximately 15% of patients and suggests a posterior pituitary hormone
deficiency, requiring further endocrinologic workup. Endocrine function should be watched closely in patients with optic nerve hypoplasia.
The cause of optic nerve hypoplasia remains unclear.
Children with periventricular leukomalacia display an unusual
form of optic nerve hypoplasia. The optic nerve demonstrates a large
cup within a normal-­size optic disc. This form of optic nerve hypoplasia occurs secondary to transsynaptic degeneration of optic axons
caused by the primary bilateral lesion in the optic radiation (periventricular leukomalacia).

OPTIC NERVE COLOBOMA

Optic nerve colobomas can be unilateral or bilateral. The visual
acuity can range from normal to complete blindness. The coloboma
develops secondary to incomplete closure of the embryonic fissure.
The defect may produce a partial or total excavation of the optic disc
(Fig. 671.2). Chorioretinal and iris colobomas may also occur (see
Chapter 662). Optic nerve colobomas may be seen in a multitude
of ocular and systemic abnormalities, including the CHARGE (C,
coloboma; H, heart disease; A, atresia choanae; R, retarded growth

This term describes a congenital malformation of the optic nerve characterized by an enlarged, excavated, funnel-­shaped disc with an elevated
rim resembling a morning glory flower. White glial tissue is present in
the central part of the disc (Fig. 671.3). The retinal vessels are abnormal
and appear at the peripheral disc, coursing over the elevated pink rim in
a radial fashion. Pigmentary mottling of the peripapillary region is usually seen. Most cases are unilateral. Females are affected twice as often
as males. Visual acuity is usually severely reduced. Morning glory disc
anomaly has been associated with basal encephalocele in patients with
midfacial anomalies. Abnormalities of the carotid circulation can also
be seen in patients with morning glory anomaly. Moyamoya disease is a
well-­described associated finding.

TILTED DISC

In this congenital anomaly, the vertical axis of the optic disc is directed
obliquely, so that the upper temporal portion of the nerve head is more
prominent and anterior to the lower nasal portion of the disc. The retinal vessels emerge from the upper temporal portion of the disc rather
than from the nasal side. Often noted is a peripapillary crescent or
conus. Associated visual field defects and myopic astigmatism may be
found. Clinical recognition of the tilted disc syndrome is important to
avoid confusion of its disc and visual field signs with those of papilledema and intracranial tumor.

DRUSEN OF THE OPTIC NERVE

These globular, acellular bodies are thought to arise from axoplasmic
derivatives of disintegrating nerve fibers. Drusen may be buried within
the optic nerve, producing elevation of the optic nerve head (pseudopapilledema), or they may be partially or completely exposed, appearing as
refractile bodies at the surface of the disc (Fig. 671.4). Visual field defects
and spontaneous hemorrhages of the peripapillary nerve fiber layer may
occur in association with drusen. Drusen may occur as an autosomal
dominant condition with incomplete penetrance. B-­scan ultrasonography can help to positively identify drusen suspected on clinical ophthalmic exam in some cases, although drusen in young children may be less
likely to be visible with ultrasonography than in adults.

PAPILLEDEMA

The term papilledema is reserved to describe swelling of the nerve
head secondary to increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Clinical
manifestations of papilledema include edematous blurring of the
disc margins, fullness or elevation of the nerve head, partial or complete obliteration of the disc cup, capillary congestion and hyperemia of the nerve head, generalized engorgement of the veins, loss
of spontaneous venous pulsation, hemorrhages in the nerve fiber
layer around the disc, and peripapillary exudates (see Fig. 671.4
and 630.2). In some cases, edema extending into the macula may
produce a fan-­or star-­shaped figure. In addition, concentric peripapillary retinal wrinkling (Paton lines) may be noted. Transient
obscuration of vision may occur, lasting seconds, and is associated
with postural changes. Vision, however, is usually normal in acute
papilledema. Normally, when the ICP is relieved, the papilledema

resolves and the disc returns to a normal or nearly normal appearance within 6-­8 weeks. Sustained chronic papilledema or long-­
standing unrelieved increased ICP may, however, lead to permanent
nerve fiber damage, atrophic changes of the disc, macular scarring,
and impairment of vision.
The pathophysiology of papilledema is probably as follows: elevation
of intracranial subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, elevation of CSF pressure in the sheath of the optic nerve, elevation of tissue
pressure in the optic nerve, stasis of axoplasmic flow and swelling of the
nerve fibers in the optic nerve head, and secondary vascular changes
and the characteristic ophthalmoscopic signs of venous stasis. Associated neuro-­ophthalmic signs of increased ICP in infants and children
include sixth cranial nerve palsy and attendant esotropia, lid retraction, paresis of upward gaze, tonic downward deviation of the eyes, and
convergent nystagmus.
The common etiologies of papilledema in childhood are intracranial tumors and obstructive hydrocephalus, intracranial hemorrhage, the cerebral edema of trauma, meningoencephalitis, toxic
encephalopathy, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and certain
metabolic diseases. Regardless of the cause, the optic disc signs of
increased ICP in early childhood may occasionally be modified by
the distensibility of the young skull. In the absence of conditions
associated with early closure of sutures and early obliteration of the
fontanel (craniosynostosis, Crouzon disease, and Apert syndrome),
infants with increased ICP may not develop papilledema.
The differential diagnosis of papilledema includes structural
changes of the disc (pseudopapilledema, pseudoneuritis, drusen,
and myelinated nerve fibers; see Fig. 671.4), with which it may be
confused, and the disc swelling of papillitis associated with optic
neuritis in addition to the disc changes of hypertension and diabetes
mellitus. Unless retinal hemorrhage or edema involves the macular
area, the preservation of good central vision and the absence of an
afferent pupillary defect (Marcus Gunn pupil) help to differentiate
acute papilledema from the edema of the optic nerve head found in
acute optic neuritis.
Papilledema is a neurologic emergency. It can be accompanied by
other signs of increased ICP, including headaches, nausea, and vomiting. Neuroimaging should be performed; if no intracranial masses are
detected, a lumbar puncture and determination of CSF pressure should
follow.

OPTIC NEURITIS

This is any inflammation or demyelinization of the optic nerve with
attendant impairment of function (see Chapter 640.2). The process
is usually acute, with rapidly progressive loss of vision. It may be
unilateral or bilateral. Pain on movement or palpation of the globe
may precede or accompany the onset of visual symptoms. There is
decreased visual activity, decreased color vision and contrast sensitivity, a relative afferent pupillary defect, and a normal macula and
peripheral retina.

3966 Part XXVII u Disorders of the Eye
When the retrobulbar portion of the nerve is affected without
ophthalmoscopically visible signs of inflammation at the disc, the
term retrobulbar optic neuritis is applied. When there is ophthalmoscopically visible evidence of inflammation of the nerve head,
the term papillitis or intraocular optic neuritis is used. When there
is involvement of both the retina and the papilla, the term optic
neuroretinitis is used.
In childhood, optic neuritis may occur as an isolated condition or
as a manifestation of a neurologic or systemic disease. Optic neuritis may be secondary to inflammatory diseases (systemic lupus
erythematosus, sarcoidosis, Behçet disease); infections (tuberculosis, syphilis, Lyme disease, meningitis, viral encephalitis, HIV, or
postinfectious disease); and toxic or nutritional disorders (methanol, ethambutol, vitamin B12 deficiency). It may signify one of the
many demyelinating diseases of childhood (see Chapter 640.2).
Although a significant percentage of adults who experience an episode of optic neuritis eventually develop other symptoms associated
with multiple sclerosis (MS), young children with optic neuritis are
seemingly at less risk (risk of MS is 19% within 20 years). High-­
risk features suggestive of MS include visual acuity better than no
light perception, periocular pain, acutely normal-­appearing optic
nerve, no retinal abnormalities, and abnormal MRI suggesting a
demyelinating disease. Bilateral optic neuritis in children may be
associated with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) or
neuromyelitis optica (NMO or Devic disease). NMO is characterized by rapid and severe bilateral visual loss accompanied by transverse myelitis and paraplegia. Involvement of the brain stem and
occasionally the cortex may be seen on MRI. NMO-­specific immunoglobulin G (directed to the aquaporin 4 water channel) is the
diagnostic test of choice for Devic syndrome. Antibody-­negative
NMO patients may have anti-­MOG (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) antibodies, suggesting another form of demyelinating
optic neuritis. Optic neuritis may also be secondary to an exogenous toxin or drug, as with lead poisoning or as a complication
of long-­term high-­dose treatment with chloramphenicol or vincristine. Extensive pediatric neurologic and ophthalmic investigation,
including MRI and lumbar puncture, is usually required. Idiopathic
NMO is associated with anti–aquaporin 4 antibodies, otherwise
known as NMO antibodies.
In most cases of acute optic neuritis, some improvement in vision
begins within 1-­4 weeks after onset, and vision may improve to normal or near normal within weeks or months. The course varies with
cause. Although central vision may recover fully, it is common to find
permanent defects in other areas of visual function (contrast sensitivity, color, brightness sense, and motion perception). Recurrences
may occur especially, but not universally, in patients who go on to
develop MS.
A treatment trial has demonstrated that high-­dose intravenous
methylprednisolone may help to speed the visual recovery in young
adults, and it may prevent the development of MS in those at risk. It is
unknown to what degree the results of the aforementioned trial may be
extrapolated to optic neuritis in childhood.

LEBER HEREDITARY OPTIC NEUROPATHY

Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is characterized by an
acute to subacute painless loss of central vision primarily affecting young males (male to female ratio 2.5:1). The incidence is
1:30,000-­50,000 people. A characteristic peripapillary telangiectatic
microangiopathy occurs not only in the presymptomatic phase of
involved eyes but also in a number of asymptomatic females (Fig.
671.5). Disc hyperemia and edema mark the acute phase of central
visual loss. One eye is usually affected before the other; the second
eye involvement begins 2-­3 months later. Visual field loss (blurring,
clouding) and impaired color vision are also present. In time, progressive optic atrophy and vision loss usually ensue. The tortuous
angiopathy becomes less obvious. Although visual function after

Fig. 671.5 A 9-­year-­old child with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy
(LHON) m.11778 presents with best-­corrected visual acuity of 20/20 in
the right eye and no symptoms (A). At age 12, retinal nerve fiber layer
swelling is observed before reduction in vision (B). His visual acuity rapidly decreases 1 month later to 20/50 and subtle temporal optic nerve
pallor is visible (C). Three months later, his visual acuity is <20/400 and
diffuse optic nerve pallor is present (D). Notice that peripapillary telangiectasia was present at age 9, 3 years before his visual symptoms started. The patient’s left eye progressed similarly to the right eye. (From
Pilz YL, Bass SJ, Sherman J. A review of mitochondrial optic neuropathies: from inherited to acquired forms. J Optometry. 2016;10:205–214:
Fig. 1, p. 208).

the initial loss generally remains stable, partial or less often complete recovery may occur in as many as 20–30% of affected individuals. This recovery may take place years or decades after the initial
episode of acute vision loss. The peripapillary angiopathy, the lack
of short-­term remission and inflammation and MRI, as well as the
degree of symmetry or peripheral motor or sensory deficits, serve
to distinguish most cases of Leber disease from the optic neuritis
of MS.
LHON is maternally inherited and is caused by pathogenic gene
variants in mitochondrial DNA (Fig. 671.6). Multiple point variants
in the mitochondrial DNA have been identified. Pathogenic variants in MTND1, MTND4 (~70%), and MTND6 represent ~90% of
cases. LHON plus is a related mitochondrial disorder affecting skeletal and cardiac muscle disorders, including electrocardiographic
abnormalities. Only ∼50% of males and 15% of females with a
pathogenic gene variant develop symptomatic LHON.
The differential diagnosis includes optic neuritis (Chapter 640.2),
other genetic optic neuropathies (Table 671.1; see also Fig. 671.6) and
toxic or nutritional neuropathies (Table 671.2).
Gene therapy with intravitreal injection of a vector-­ND4 gene has
had success improving vision in patients with LHON.

OPTIC ATROPHY

This term denotes degeneration of optic nerve axons, with attendant loss of function. The ophthalmoscopic signs of optic atrophy
are pallor of the disc and loss of substance of the nerve head, sometimes with enlargement of the disc cup. The associated vision defect
varies with the nature and site of the primary disease or lesion.
Optic atrophy is the common expression of a wide variety of congenital or acquired pathologic processes (Table 671.3). The cause may
be traumatic, inflammatory, degenerative, neoplastic, or vascular;
intracranial tumors and hydrocephalus are principal causes of optic
atrophy in children. In some cases, progressive optic atrophy is hereditary. Dominantly inherited infantile optic atrophy is a relatively
mild heredodegenerative type that tends to progress through childhood and adolescence. Autosomal recessively inherited congenital
optic atrophy is a rare condition that is evident at birth or develops at

a very early age; the visual defect is usually profound. Behr optic atrophy is a hereditary type associated with hypertonia of the extremities,
increased deep tendon reflexes, mild cerebellar ataxia, some degree of

mental deficiency, and possibly external ophthalmoplegia. This disorder principally afflicts boys 3-­11 years of age. Some forms of heredodegenerative optic atrophy are associated with sensorineural hearing loss,
as may occur in some children with juvenile-­onset (insulin-­dependent)
diabetes mellitus. In the absence of an obvious cause, optic atrophy in
an infant or child warrants extensive etiologic investigation.

OPTIC NERVE GLIOMA

Optic nerve glioma, more properly referred to as juvenile pilocytic
astrocytoma, is the most frequent tumor of the optic nerve in childhood (Fig. 671.7). This neuroglial tumor may develop in the intraorbital, intracanalicular, or intracranial portion of the nerve; the chiasm
is often involved.
The tumor is a cytologically benign hamartoma that is generally
stationary or only slowly progressive. The principal clinical manifestations when the tumor occurs in the intraorbital portion of the
nerve are unilateral loss of vision, proptosis, and deviation of the eye;
optic atrophy or congestion of the optic nerve head may occur. Chiasmal involvement may be attended by defects of vision and visual
fields (often bitemporal hemianopia), increased ICP, papilledema or
optic atrophy, hypothalamic dysfunction, pituitary dysfunction, and
sometimes nystagmus or strabismus. Juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas
occur with increased frequency in patients with neurofibromatosis
(see Chapter 636.1).
Treatment of optic pathway gliomas is controversial. The best
management is usually periodic observation with serial radiography

(preferably MRI). Only symptomatic and radiographically progressing optic nerve gliomas require strong consideration for treatment.
If a patient has unsightly proptosis with complete or nearly complete
loss of vision of the affected eye, surgical removal may be appropriate when the tumor is confined to the intraorbital, intracanalicular,
or prechiasmal portion of the nerve. When the chiasm is involved,
resection is not usually indicated, and radiation and chemotherapy
may be necessary.

TRAUMATIC OPTIC NEUROPATHIES

Injury to the optic nerve may result from both direct and indirect
trauma. Direct trauma to the optic nerve is a result of a penetrating
injury to the orbit with transection or contusion of the nerve. Blunt
trauma to the orbit may also lead to severe visual loss if the traumatic
force is transmitted to the optic canal and causes disruption of the
blood supply to the intracanalicular portion of the nerve. Treatment
with high-­dose corticosteroids has not proved to be effective; it has
been shown that similar regimens involve an increased relative risk of
death when they are given to patients who have experienced significant
head injuries.

infantile (congenital); that which begins between the ages of 5 and 30
years is called juvenile.
Primary glaucoma indicates that the cause is an isolated anomaly of the
drainage apparatus of the eye (trabecular meshwork). More than 50% of
infantile cases are primary glaucoma. In secondary glaucoma, other ocular
or systemic abnormalities are associated, even if a similar developmental
defect of the trabecular meshwork is also present. Primary infantile glaucoma occurs with an incidence of 0.03% (Table 672.1).

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

The symptoms of infantile glaucoma include the classic triad of epiphora
(tearing), photophobia (sensitivity to light), and blepharospasm (eyelid
squeezing; Fig. 672.1). Each can be attributed to corneal irritation. Only
approximately 30% of affected infants demonstrate the classic symptom
complex. Signs of glaucoma include corneal edema, corneal and ocular
enlargement, and conjunctival injection (Fig. 672.2).

The sclera and cornea are more elastic in early childhood than later
in life. An increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) therefore leads to an
expansion of the globe, including the cornea, and the development of
buphthalmos (“ox eye”). If the cornea continues to enlarge, breaks occur
in the endothelial basement membrane (Descemet’s membrane) and
may lead to permanent corneal scarring. These breaks in Descemet’s
membrane (Haab striae) are visible as horizontal edematous lines that
cross or curve around the central cornea. They rarely occur beyond 3
years of age or in corneas <12 mm in diameter. The cornea also becomes
edematous and cloudy, with increased IOP. The corneal edema leads to
tearing and photophobia. If any of these other signs or symptoms are
present, glaucoma should be considered in a child suspected of having a
nasolacrimal duct obstruction.
Children with unilateral glaucoma generally present early because the
difference in the corneal size between the eyes can be noticed. When the
disease is bilateral, parents may not recognize the increased corneal size.

Fig. 672.2 Infantile glaucoma. The left cornea is enlarged and edematous.

Many parents view the large eyes as attractive and do not seek help until
other symptoms develop.
Cupping of the optic nerve head is detected by ocular examination.
The optic nerve of an infant is easily distended by excessive pressure.
Deep central cupping readily occurs and may regress with normalization of pressure.
Some infants and children with early-­onset glaucoma have more extensive maldevelopment of the anterior segment of the eye. The neurocristopathies, particularly those involving the anterior segment (Axenfeld-­Rieger
syndrome: FOXC1, PITX2, CYP1B1, PRDM5 genes), produce early-­onset
glaucoma. They are usually bilateral and may include abnormalities of the
iris, cornea, and lens. Other ocular anomalies that may be associated with
glaucoma in infants and children are aniridia, cataract, spherophakia, and
ectopia lentis. Glaucoma may also develop secondary to persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous or retinopathy of prematurity.
Trauma, intraocular hemorrhage, ocular inflammatory disease, and
intraocular tumor are also important causes of glaucoma in the pediatric population. Systemic disorders associated with glaucoma in infants
and children are Sturge-­Weber syndrome (see Chapter 636.3), neurofibromatosis (see Chapter 636.1), Lowe syndrome, Marfan syndrome
(see Chapter 743), congenital rubella (see Chapters 149 and 294), and a
number of chromosomal syndromes (see Chapter 99).

Glaucoma occurs frequently in children with a history of congenital
cataracts. Glaucoma may develop in up to 25% of children who have
undergone cataract surgery early in life. The cause of aphakic glaucoma
is not known but is thought to be the result of a coexistent anterior
chamber deformity. Children treated for cataracts must be monitored
closely for this complication, which may threaten vision.

DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT

The diagnosis of infantile glaucoma is made on recognition of the signs
and symptoms. Once the diagnosis is established, treatment is started
promptly. Unlike adult glaucoma, in which medication is often the first
line of therapy, for infantile glaucoma the treatment is primarily surgical.
The differential diagnosis is noted in Table 672.2.
Procedures used to treat glaucoma in children include surgery to establish a more normal anterior chamber angle (goniotomy and trabeculotomy), to create a site for aqueous fluid to exit the eye (trabeculectomy and
Seton surgery), or to reduce aqueous fluid production (cyclocryotherapy
and cyclophotocoagulation). Many children frequently require several
operations to lower and maintain their IOP adequately, and long-­term
medical therapy may be necessary as well. Patients with multiple ocular
abnormalities and those with aphakic glaucoma generally require more
surgeries to achieve and maintain adequate IOP control. Although vision
may be reduced secondary to glaucomatous optic nerve damage or corneal
scarring, amblyopia is the most common cause of loss of vision in these
children.

Orbital Abnormalities
Scott E. Olitsky and Justin D. Marsh
HYPERTELORISM AND HYPOTELORISM

Hypertelorism is wide separation of the eyes or an increased interorbital distance, which may occur as a morphogenetic variant, a primary
deformity, or a secondary phenomenon in association with developmental abnormalities, such as frontal meningocele or encephalocele or
the persistence of a facial cleft. Often-­associated conditions are strabismus, exotropia, and sometimes optic atrophy.
Hypotelorism refers to narrowness of the interorbital distance,
which may occur as a morphogenetic variant alone or in association
with other anomalies, such as epicanthus or holoprosencephaly, or secondary to a cranial dystrophy, such as scaphocephaly.

EXOPHTHALMOS AND ENOPHTHALMOS

Protrusion of the eye is referred to as exophthalmos or proptosis and is
a common indicator of orbital disease. It may be caused by shallowness
of the orbits, as in many craniofacial malformations, or by increased
tissue mass within the orbit, as with neoplastic, vascular, and inflammatory disorders. Ocular complications include exposure keratopathy,
ocular motor disturbances, and optic atrophy with loss of vision.
Posterior displacement or sinking of the eye back into the orbit is
referred to as enophthalmos. This may occur with orbital fracture or
with atrophy of orbital tissue.

3971

inflammation and fibrosis in extraorbital tissue (pancreas, retroperitoneal); systemic IgG4-­related disease is more common in patients with
bilateral lacrimal gland involvement.
The differential diagnosis of NSOI includes sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, lymphoma, and thyroid orbitopathy (Fig. 673.3).
In addition, Tolosa Hunt syndrome may mimic NSOI; manifestations
include unilateral headache, brow and eye pain, and cranial nerve
palsies with associated cavernous sinus granulomatosis (Fig. 673.4).
Biopsy is not initially needed for patients with NSOI who have a typical presentation (usually myositis) or a higher biopsy risk (orbital apex-­
optic nerve). Therapy is usually initiated with systemic corticosteroids.
Thyroid-­related ophthalmopathy (see Chapter 601) is believed to
be secondary to an immune mechanism, leading to inflammation and
deposition of mucopolysaccharides and collagen in the extraocular
muscles and orbital fat. Involvement of the extraocular muscles may
lead to a restrictive strabismus. Lid retraction and exophthalmos may
cause corneal exposure and infection or perforation. Involvement of
the posterior orbit can compress the optic nerve. Treatment of thyroid-­
related ophthalmopathy may include the use of systemic corticosteroids, radiation of the orbit, eyelid surgery, strabismus surgery, or
orbital decompression to eliminate symptoms and protect vision. The
degree of orbital involvement is often independent of the status of the
systemic disease.

ORBITAL INFLAMMATION
Nonspecific Orbital Inflammation/Idiopathic Orbital
Inflammation/Orbital Pseudotumor

Nonspecific orbital inflammation (NSOI) is an acute or subacute,
usually benign, idiopathic inflammatory process of unknown etiology manifesting in specific orbital structures but usually with no
systemic features. After thyroid-­associated disease and lymphoproliferative disorders, it is the third most common noninfectious masslike
inflammatory lesion of the orbit. It is unilateral in ∼80% of patients,
who often present with periorbital edema, ptosis, limited extraocular
motion, pain, proptosis, conjunctival injection, chemosis or, less often,
decreased visual acuity. There are five categories involving specific
orbit tissues: dacryoadenitis (Fig. 673.1A), myositis (see Fig. 673.1B),
anterior orbit (see Fig. 673.1C), posterior orbit apex (optic nerve;
Fig. 673.2), and diffuse. Lacrimal gland inflammation and orbital myositis are the most common manifestations. The apical (orbital apex
syndrome) often affects visual acuity and cranial nerves III, IV, and
VI, as well as the first division of CN V. There is an association with a
sclerosing IgG4-­related disease variant, which may also manifest with

TUMORS OF THE ORBIT

Various tumors occur in and about the orbit in childhood. Among
benign tumors, the most common are vascular lesions (principally

(see Chapter 673). Pain, redness, swelling, increase in tearing, and discharge over the lacrimal gland are noted and usually visible at the lateral
one third of the upper eyelid; concurrent preauricular lymphadenopathy
may be noted (Fig. 674.1). It may occur with mumps (in which case it is
usually acute and bilateral, subsiding in a few days or weeks), with influenza, infectious mononucleosis, and herpes zoster. Staphylococcus aureus
may produce a suppurative dacryoadenitis, and other bacterial causes
include streptococci and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Chronic dacryoadenitis is associated with certain systemic diseases, particularly sarcoidosis,
tuberculosis, and syphilis. Some systemic diseases may produce enlargement of the lacrimal and salivary glands (Mikulicz syndrome).

are most commonly seen in patients with neurofibromatosis and may
present with poor vision or proptosis. Retinoblastoma (see Chapter
551) may extend into the orbit if it is discovered late or goes untreated.
Teratomas are rare tumors that typically grow rapidly after birth and
exhibit explosive proptosis.
The effects of orbital tumors vary with their locations and growth
patterns. The principal signs are proptosis, resistance to retroplacement
of the eye, and impairment of eye movement. A palpable mass may be
found. Other significant signs are ptosis, optic nerve head congestion,
optic atrophy, and loss of vision. Bruit and visible pulsation of the globe
are important clues to vascular lesions.
Evaluation of orbital tumors includes ultrasonography, MRI, and
CT. Pseudotumor of the orbit also must be considered in children with
signs of a mass lesion. In selected cases, an incisional or excisional
biopsy of the lesion may be warranted.

Orbital Infections
Scott E. Olitsky, Justin D. Marsh, and
Mary Anne Jackson

Orbital infections are common in children. It is important to be able
to distinguish the different forms of infection that occur in the orbital
region to allow rapid diagnosis and treatment to prevent loss of vision or
spread of the infection to the nearby intracranial structures (Table 674.1).

DACRYOADENITIS

Dacryoadenitis is inflammation of the lacrimal gland; it most commonly occurs in the pediatric population and in some young adults and
is related to a variety of infectious pathogens or inflammatory processes

Dacryocystitis is an infection of the lacrimal sac and generally requires
obstruction of the nasolacrimal system to allow its development.
Acute, subacute, and chronic forms are described. Most patients with
dacryocystitis present with redness and swelling over the region of the
lacrimal sac (Fig. 674.2). It is treated with warm compresses and systemic antibiotics. This helps control the infection, but the obstruction
usually requires definitive treatment to reduce the risk of recurrence.
Dacryocystitis may occur in newborns as a complication of a congenital dacryocystocele (see Chapter 665). If present, systemic antibiotics and digital pressure for decompression are recommended. The
obstruction of the nasolacrimal system may resolve once the infection
clears. If spontaneous resolution does not occur, probing should be
considered within a short time frame. An intranasal cyst may be present in conjunction with the dacryocystocele. If this occurs, marsupialization of the cyst may be needed at the time of the probing.

PRESEPTAL CELLULITIS

Inflammation of the lids and periorbital tissues without signs of true
orbital involvement (such as proptosis or limitation of eye movement)
is generally referred to as periorbital or preseptal cellulitis and is a form
of facial cellulitis. This is a common entity in young children, usually
under age 5 years, and may rarely be caused by direct seeding related
to bacteremia (usually seen in those <3 years), or more often sinusitis,

Periorbital necrotizing fasciitis is a severe, rapidly spreading
form of periorbital bacterial infection, involving both superficial and
deep fascial planes. The disease may have no preceding events or may
follow trauma to the periorbital skin. Initial symptoms resemble periorbital/facial cellulitis but rapidly progress to tissue necrosis, blistering, and significant systemic toxicity. Streptococci and S. aureus are
the most common pathogens. Treatment includes broad spectrum
antibiotics, surgical debridement, and, when available, hyperbaric
oxygen therapy.

trauma, or other infected wounds in the periorbital region, or an
abscess of the lid or periorbital region (pyoderma, hordeolum, conjunctivitis, dacryocystitis, insect bite). Brown recluse spider bites
are often associated with considerable local swelling, and in the
first 24 hours, the bite itself may not be obvious to the parent or the
examiner.
Patients present with eyelid swelling; the edema may be so intense
as to make it difficult to evaluate the globe. Before the Haemophilus
influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine, the most common cause of pediatric preseptal (facial) cellulitis was bacteremia caused by Hib. Group
A streptococcus (GAS), pneumococcus, and S. aureus (especially if
related to an infected wound or bite) are the most common identifiable etiologic agents. Occasionally, young children with herpes simplex
virus infection of the periorbital tissues will present first with swelling
and redness, followed by the appearance of discrete tiny ulcers.
Clinical examination will show lack of proptosis, with normal painless ocular movements, normal vision, and normal pupil responses. CT
imaging can demonstrate edema of the lids and subcutaneous tissues
anterior to the orbital septum (Fig. 674.3); imaging is not necessary in
those without signs of an orbital process. Antibiotic therapy and careful
clinical monitoring and evaluation to identify signs of local progression are essential. In well-­appearing children with infected traumatic
wounds or insect bites associated with periorbital cellulitis, oral antibiotics that target S. aureus and GAS may be considered. For young
children in whom a hematogenous process is suspected, or in any toxic,
ill-­appearing child, blood cultures should be obtained, and hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics are required. Most recommend intravenous ampicillin with sulbactam or intravenous clindamycin plus
cefotaxime (or ceftriaxone) for hospitalized patients.

Inflammation of the tissues of the orbit, characterized by the triad of
proptosis, painful limitation of movement of the eye (ophthalmoplegia), and potentially decreased visual acuity, is termed orbital cellulitis
(see Table 674.1). Edema of the conjunctiva (chemosis) and inflammation and swelling of the eyelids may be seen. The mean age is ∼7 years,
ranges from 1 week to 18 years, and has a 2:1 predilection in males.
An increased risk is seen in the winter because complicated obligatory sinusitis often follows respiratory viral infection (e.g., influenza).
Patients often feel ill, are febrile, and appear toxic, and leukocytosis
sometimes but not always may be appreciated. Practitioners should
have an increased clinical suspicion for intracranial extension in those
with headache, vomiting, and any focal neurologic findings.
Orbital cellulitis may follow direct infection of the orbit from a
wound, hematogenous seeding of organisms during bacteremia, or more
often direct extension or venous spread of infection from contiguous
sites such as the lids, conjunctiva, globe, lacrimal gland, nasolacrimal
sac, or more commonly from the paranasal (ethmoid) sinuses. The differential diagnosis includes idiopathic orbital inflammation, myositis,
sarcoidosis, granulomatous vasculitis, leukemia, lymphoma, histiocytic
disorders, rhabdomyosarcoma, ruptured dermoid cyst, orbital trauma,
and orbital foreign body (see Chapter 673). In some cases, primary or
metastatic tumor in the orbit can produce the clinical picture of orbital
cellulitis.
Although the most common cause of orbital cellulitis in children is
direct extension or venous spread from infected paranasal sinuses, an
antecedent history of sinusitis requiring antibiotic therapy is generally
not reported. The spread of infection to the orbit from the sinuses is more
prevalent in children because of their thinner bony septa and sinus wall,
greater porosity of bones, open suture lines, and larger vascular foramina
(Fig. 674.4). The spread of infection is also facilitated by the venous and
lymphatic communication between the sinuses and surrounding structures, which allow flow in either direction, facilitating retrograde thrombophlebitis. Frequently noted pathogenic organisms include S. aureus,
streptococcus species (especially Streptococcus anginosus also known
as the Streptococcus milleri group, and S. pyogenes), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and anaerobes (e.g., Bacteroides spp., Prevotella spp.).

Chapter 674 u Orbital Infections
The potential for complications is high. Visual loss can occur secondary to an increase in orbital pressure that causes retinal artery or
ophthalmic vein occlusion or optic neuritis. This is more likely to occur
in the presence of an orbital abscess. Extension of infection from the
orbit into the cranial cavity may lead to cavernous sinus thrombosis or meningitis, epidural or subdural empyema, or brain abscesses
(Fig. 674.5). Additional complications include optic atrophy, exposure
keratitis, and retinal or choroidal ischemia. An interdisciplinary team
involving an infectious disease specialist, ophthalmologist, otolaryngologist, and, where indicated, a pediatric neurosurgeon should be
involved in the care of the patient with orbital infection.
Orbital cellulitis must be recognized promptly and treated aggressively. Hospitalization and systemic antibiotic therapy are indicated.
All patients with suspected orbital cellulitis should undergo contrast
CT imaging of the orbit, paranasal sinuses, and adjacent cortex. Lumbar puncture should not be considered unless there is a meningitis presentation (and only after CT imaging), assuming there are no signs of
elevated intracranial pressure or focal neurologic findings on examination. Parenteral antibiotics should be initiated immediately. Antimicrobial agents should begin with intravenous ampicillin with sulbactam or
intravenous clindamycin plus ceftriaxone, cefepime (or cefotaxime); in
cases where there is suspicion for intracranial extension, vancomycin
plus cefotaxime (or ceftriaxone) plus metronidazole should be given.

3975

If the patient does not show evidence of improvement or if there are
signs of progression, sinus and abscess drainage should be considered.
The presence of an orbital or unresponsive subperiosteal abscess (see
Fig. 674.4) may require urgent drainage of the orbit. The clinical presentation and course of each individual patient should dictate the need
and timing of abscess drainage.
Most children (especially those <9 years of age) with a medial subperiosteal abscess can initially be managed with intravenous antibiotics, which usually are sufficient for resolution of the subperiosteal
abscess. Adjunctive use of corticosteroids is controversial but may
hasten resolution. Patients should be examined frequently for signs
of visual deterioration or pupillary abnormalities. Most will become
afebrile within 48 hours and have examination improvement by 72
hours. If there are pupillary abnormalities, decreased vision, or failure
to improve, the subperiosteal abscess should be drained.
Many recommend drainage for a subperiosteal abscess and an orbital
abscess in older children. Additionally, abscesses involving the orbital roof
with associated frontal sinus disease may require more frequent surgical
intervention. Operative procedures should be coordinated with the otolaryngologist to allow for sinus drainage at the same time that the subperiosteal abscess is drained, and cultures should be obtained from the sinus and
the abscess. Similarly, if neurosurgical intervention is required, operative
coordination should occur with ophthalmology and otolaryngology.

ENDOPHTHALMITIS

Hemorrhage into vitreous

Endophthalmitis is infection of the aqueous and/or vitreous humors
and is rare in children; major predisposing factors are noted in Table
674.2. Endogenous hematogenous bacterial (S. aureus, streptococci,
gram-­negative bacilli) and fungal (candida, Aspergillus spp., Fusarium)
may be seen in immunosuppressed and neutropenic patients, whereas
histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, coccidiomycosis, and cryptococcus
endophthalmitis may rarely be seen as part of disseminated systemic
mycotic infection. In addition, ocular toxocariasis may mimic bacterial
or fungal endophthalmitis.
The diagnosis requires vitreous sampling because aqueous samples
are often negative. The pathogen may be identified by staining, culture,
and molecular methods.
Treatment of bacterial endophthalmitis requires intravitreal antibiotics; systemic antibiotics alone are ineffective. Fungal disease often
requires combined intraocular and systemic antifungal agents.

Approximately 30% of all blindness in children results from trauma.
Children and adolescents account for a disproportionate number of
episodes of ocular trauma. Males ages 11-­15 years are the most vulnerable; their injuries outnumber those in females by a ratio of about 4:1.
The majority of injuries are related to sports, sticks, stones, fireworks,
paint balls, air-­powered BB guns, and other projectiles. High-­velocity
projectiles and fireworks cause particularly devastating ocular and
orbital injuries. Much of the trauma is avoidable (see Chapter 14). Any
part of the orbit or globe may be affected (Figs. 675.1 and 675.2).

ECCHYMOSIS AND SWELLING OF THE EYELIDS

Ecchymosis and edema of the eyelids are common after blunt trauma
(Fig. 675.3). These disorders are self-­limiting, absorb spontaneously,
and can be treated with iced compresses and analgesics. Periorbital

Chapter 675 u Injuries to the Eye
ecchymosis should prompt careful examination of the eye and surrounding structures for more serious injuries such as orbital bone fracture, intraocular hemorrhage, or rupture of the globe.

LACERATIONS OF THE EYELIDS

Eyelid lacerations may vary from simple to complex. When evaluating
an eyelid laceration, key findings include the depth of the laceration,
its location, and whether there is involvement of the canaliculus (lacrimal ducts). Most superficial eyelid lacerations may be closed by the
primary caregiver, but if a laceration is deep, involves the lid margin,
or involves the canaliculus, it should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist. The levator muscle is responsible for elevation of the upper eyelid
and runs deep to the skin and orbicularis oculi muscle. If the levator
muscle is compromised and not recognized at initial repair, ptosis
will occur. Therefore, if orbital fat is visible in the laceration, the laceration has compromised the skin, orbicularis oculi, levator muscles,
and orbital septum and must be meticulously repaired to avoid ptosis.
Eyelid margin involvement (Fig. 675.4) also requires careful repair to
avoid lid malposition and notch formation. These can lead to ocular
surface problems in the future, resulting in corneal scarring and loss
of vision. Lacerations involving the canaliculus require intubation of
the nasolacrimal system, in addition to repair of the laceration of the
eyelid to avoid future tearing problems. Proper primary repair of eyelid
lacerations often achieves a superior outcome to secondary repair at a
later date. As with any eyelid injury, careful examination of the eye and
surrounding tissue is required.

with the aid of magnification (Fig. 675.6) or a direct ophthalmoscope
set on a high plus lens (+10 or +12). In many cases, slit-­lamp examination is necessary, especially if the particle is deep or metallic. Some
conjunctival foreign bodies tend to lodge under the upper eyelid,
causing the sensation of corneal foreign body, as they make contact
with the globe on eyelid movement; they may also produce vertically
oriented linear corneal abrasions (Fig. 675.7). Finding these abrasions should lead to a suspicion of such a foreign body, and eversion
of the lid may be necessary (see Chapter 659). If a foreign body is suspected but not found, further examination is indicated. If the history
suggests injury with a high-­velocity particle, radiologic examination
of the eye may be needed to explore the possibility of an intraocular
foreign body.
Removal of a foreign body can be facilitated by instillation of a drop of
topical anesthetic. Many foreign bodies can be removed by irrigation or
by gently wiping them away with a moistened cotton-­tipped applicator.
Embedded foreign bodies or foreign bodies in the central cornea should
be treated by an ophthalmologist. Removal of corneal foreign bodies may
leave epithelial defects, which are treated as corneal abrasions. Metallic
foreign bodies may cause rust to form in the corneal tissues; examination

SUPERFICIAL ABRASIONS OF THE CORNEA

When the corneal epithelium is scratched, abraded, or denuded, it
exposes the underlying epithelial basement layer and superficial corneal nerves. This is accompanied by pain, tearing, photophobia, and
decreased vision. Corneal abrasions are detected by instilling fluorescein
dye and inspecting the cornea using a blue-­filtered light (Fig. 675.5). A
slit lamp is ideal for this examination, but a direct ophthalmoscope with
a blue filter or a handheld Wood lamp is adequate for young children.
Treatment of a corneal abrasion is directed at promoting healing
and relieving pain. Abrasions are treated with frequent applications
of a topical antibiotic ointment until the epithelium is completely
healed. The use of a semipressure patch does not improve healing time
or decrease pain. An improperly applied patch may itself abrade the
cornea. A topical cycloplegic agent (cyclopentolate hydrochloride 1%)
can relieve the pain from ciliary spasm in patients with large abrasions.
Topical anesthetics should not be given at home because they retard
epithelial healing and inhibit the natural blinking reflex.

FOREIGN BODY INVOLVING THE OCULAR
SURFACE

This usually produces acute discomfort, tearing, and inflammation.
Most foreign bodies can be detected by examination in good light

by an ophthalmologist 1 or 2 days after removal of a foreign body is recommended because a rust ring might require further treatment.

HYPHEMA

This is the presence of blood in the anterior chamber of the eye. It may
occur with either a blunt or perforating injury and represents a situation
that may threaten vision. Hyphema appears as a bright or dark red fluid
level between the cornea and iris, or as a diffuse murkiness of the aqueous
humor. Children with hyphema present with acute loss of vision, with or
without pain. The treatment of hyphema involves efforts to minimize the
vision-­threatening sequelae, such as rebleeding, glaucoma, and corneal
blood staining. Bedrest is necessary, ideally with elevation of the head
of the bed to 30 degrees. A shield (without underlying patch) is placed
on the affected eye to prevent repeat trauma, and a cycloplegic agent
is used to immobilize the iris. In addition, topical or systemic steroids
are used to minimize intraocular inflammation. Antiemetics should be
considered if the patient is experiencing nausea. All nonsteroidal anti-­
inflammatories and aspirin must be avoided. Rarely, hospitalization and
sedation may be necessary to ensure compliance in some children. If the
intraocular pressure is elevated, topical and systemic pressure-­lowering
medications are used. If the pressure is not controllable by such measures, then surgical evacuation of the clot may be required to minimize
the risk of permanent vision loss. Patients with sickle cell disease or trait
are at higher risk of acute loss of vision secondary to elevated intraocular pressure or optic nerve infarction and may require more aggressive
intervention. Individuals with a history of traumatic hyphema have an
increased incidence of glaucoma later in life and should be monitored on
a regular basis throughout their lives.

OPEN GLOBE

A penetrating, perforating, or blunt injury resulting in compromise
of the cornea or sclera of the eye is one of the most sight-­threatening
injuries that can be sustained (Fig. 675.8). An open globe is a true ophthalmologic emergency that requires prompt, careful evaluation and
immediate repair to minimize vision loss. Permanent vision loss can
result from corneal scarring, loss of intraocular contents, or infection.
Evaluation involves careful history, including time and mechanism of
the injury, as well as visual acuity and inspection of the eye. A full-­
thickness corneal wound will often present with prolapsed iris tissue
through the wound. If this is not immediately evident, a peaked or
irregular pupil may be a sign of full-­thickness laceration. Scleral compromise may be more difficult to identify because of overlying structures. The thinnest part of the sclera is at the corneoscleral junction
(the limbus) and just posterior to the insertion of the rectus muscles.
When an open globe is caused by blunt force injury, these are the two

and a traumatic cataract. B, CT imaging demonstrating a shallow left
anterior chamber when compared to the right (arrow) but without evidence of an intraocular foreign body. (From Hwang RY, Schoenberger

areas most likely involved. A ruptured globe occurs when the compressive traumatic force is high enough to lead to a rupture of the
globe itself. Although the term ruptured globe is frequently used to
describe any open eye, the term should be reserved for this specific
form of trauma. The force required to rupture the globe often is
severe enough to lead to other permanent injuries to the eye with a
resultant poor prognosis even when the rupture itself can be repaired.
This specific term denotes a poorer prognosis than many other forms
of open globe injuries.
The overlying conjunctiva may not be compromised but a subconjunctival hemorrhage may be present, obscuring the view. In these
cases, look for a shallow anterior chamber, low intraocular pressure,
or pigment within the involved area. If the patient has been diagnosed
with an open globe, the examination should be stopped, an eye shield
placed immediately, and the ophthalmologist contacted to minimize
further ocular compromise.

OPTIC NERVE TRAUMA

The optic nerve may be injured in both penetrating and blunt trauma.
The injury may occur at any point between the globe and the chiasm.
Traumatic injury to the optic nerve, regardless of cause or location,
results in reduced vision and a pupillary defect. Direct trauma to the
intraorbital optic nerve may cause transection, partial transection, or
optic sheath hemorrhage. Fractures involving the skull base may cause
injury to the intracranial portions of the optic nerve. Treatment decisions are difficult because there are no universally accepted guidelines,
and the prognosis for good visual outcome is often poor. Medical management involves observation and the use of high-­dose corticosteroids,
although the use of corticosteroids has not been proven to improve
visual outcomes and has been shown to increase the risk of death in
patients with significant head injury. Surgical intervention involves
optic nerve sheath decompression for nerve sheath hemorrhages. If
compression of the optic nerve is secondary to orbital hemorrhage,
prompt lateral canthotomy and cantholysis should be performed to
relieve intraorbital pressure. Decompression of the optic canal may be
performed if there is compression of the optic nerve by a bone fragment. Optic canal decompression is controversial in the absence of
direct bone compression.

Chapter 675 u Injuries to the Eye
CHEMICAL INJURIES

Chemical burns of the cornea and adnexal tissue are among the most
urgent of ocular emergencies, and they are most common in toddler
and preschool-­age children and men. Laundry detergent pods have
become an increasingly common source of ocular injury to young children over the last decade. Alkali burns are usually more destructive
than acid burns because they react with fats to form soaps, which damage cell membranes, allowing further penetration of the alkali into the
eye. Acids generally cause less severe, more localized tissue damage.
The corneal epithelium offers moderate protection against weak acids,
and little damage occurs unless the pH is 2.5 or less. Most stronger
acids precipitate tissue proteins, creating a physical barrier against their
further penetration.
Mild acid or alkali burns are characterized by conjunctival injection
and swelling and mild corneal epithelial erosions. The corneal stroma
may be mildly edematous, and the anterior chamber may have mild to
moderate cell and flare reactions. With strong acids, the cornea and
conjunctiva rapidly become white and opaque. The corneal epithelium
may slough, leaving a relatively clear stroma; this appearance may initially mask the severity of the burn. Severe alkali burns are characterized by corneal opacification.
Emergency treatment of a chemical burn begins with immediate,
copious irrigation with water or saline. Local debridement and removal
of foreign particles should be performed as irrigation continues. If the
nature of the chemical injury is unknown, the use of pH test paper is
helpful in determining whether the agent was basic or acidic. Irrigation should continue for at least 30 minutes or until 2 L of irrigant has
been instilled in mild cases and for 2-­4 hours or until 10 L of irrigant has been instilled in severe cases. At the end of irrigation, the pH
should be within a normal range (7.3-­7.7). The pH should be checked
again approximately 30 minutes after irrigation to ensure that it has
not changed. The goal of treatment is to minimize sequelae that may
threaten vision, such as conjunctival scarring, corneal scarring/opacification, glaucoma, cataract, and phthisis.

ORBITAL FRACTURES

The orbit is the bony structure surrounding the eye. Any of these bones
may fracture in a traumatic incident. Superior and lateral wall fractures are
the least common of the fracture sites, but superior orbital fracture is
the most significant because of the potential of intracranial injury. The
medial wall of the orbit is very susceptible to fracture because of the
thin nature of the lamina papyracea. Perhaps the most common site of
fracture from blunt trauma is the orbital floor. This is often referred to
as blowout fracture. At times, the fracture may act as a trapdoor, entrapping orbital contents within the fracture site. In some cases, there may
be very little external evidence of trauma, the so called “white-­eyed
blow-­out fracture.”
The patient often presents with a recent history of periorbital trauma
and pain. Diplopia, eyelid swelling, eye movement restriction, or hypesthesia may or may not be present. Eye symptoms may be associated
with nausea and bradycardia if the inferior rectus is entrapped in the
fracture site. A complete ophthalmic examination, including visual
acuity, examination of the pupil for ocular alignment, ocular motility,
anterior segment, and fundus status, as well as the history of the injury,
is required because there are often accompanying ocular injuries. The
diagnosis of fracture is suspected if eye misalignment, eye movement
restriction, or enophthalmos (sunken eye) are present. The diagnosis
can be verified by orbital CT scan, although small areas of entrapped
muscle may easily be missed if careful attention is not directed toward
the fracture site.
Medical management includes iced compresses to the orbit and elevation of the head of the bed for the first 24-­48 hours. Broad-­spectrum
antibiotics are sometimes recommended for 14 days because of the
exposure of the orbital contents to the sinus cavity. In medial wall fractures, instructions not to blow one’s nose should be given to the patient
to avoid orbital emphysema and subsequent optic nerve compression.
Consider neurosurgical consultation in orbital roof fractures. Indications for surgical repair of orbital fractures are diplopia in primary gaze
or downgaze that persists for 2 weeks, enophthalmos, or fracture of the

3979

orbital floor involving more than half of the floor. Extraocular muscle
entrapment often requires prompt surgical repair because affected
patients have significant pain, nausea, and vomiting that are difficult to
control. Rarely, extraocular muscle entrapment can cause activation of
the oculocardiac reflex, requiring urgent fracture repair.

PENETRATING WOUNDS OF THE ORBIT

These demand careful evaluation for possible damage to the eye, optic
nerve, orbital contents, or brain. Examination should include investigation for a retained foreign body. Orbital hemorrhage and infection
are common with penetrating wounds of the orbit; such injuries must
be treated as emergencies.

CHILD ABUSE

See Chapter 17.
This is a major cause of injuries to the eye and orbital region. The
possibility of nonaccidental trauma must be considered in any child
with ecchymosis or laceration of the lids, hemorrhage in or about
the eye, cataract or dislocated lens, retinal detachment, or fracture of
the orbit. Inflicted childhood neurotrauma (shaken baby syndrome)
occurs secondary to violent, nonaccidental, repetitive, unrestrained
acceleration-­deceleration head and neck movements, with or without blunt head trauma in children typically younger than 3 years of
age. Inflicted childhood neurotrauma accounts for approximately
10% of all cases of child abuse and carries a mortality rate of up to
25%. Detection of abuse is not only important to treat the pathology
that is discovered but also to prevent further abuse or even death.
The ocular manifestations are numerous and may have a prominent
role in recognition of this syndrome. Retinal hemorrhage is the most
common ophthalmic finding and occurs at all levels of the retina.
The pattern of hemorrhage helps distinguish this disorder from
other causes of retinal hemorrhage or from accidental injuries (Fig.
675.9). Retinal hemorrhages can occur without associated intracranial pathology.

FIREWORKS-­RELATED INJURIES

Injuries related to the use of fireworks can be the most devastating of all ocular traumas that occur in children. At least 20% of
emergency department visits for fireworks-­related injuries are for
ocular trauma. In the United States, a majority of these injuries
take place around Independence Day, and most occur despite adult
supervision.

SPORTS-­RELATED OCULAR INJURIES AND THEIR
PREVENTION

Although sports injuries occur in all age-­groups, far more children
and adolescents participate in high-­risk sports than adults. The greater
number of participating children, their athletic immaturity, and the
increased likelihood of their using inadequate or improper eye protection account for their disproportionate share of sports-­related eye
injuries (see Chapter 734).
The sports with the highest risk of eye injury are those in which no
eye protection can be worn, including boxing, wrestling, and martial
arts. Other high-­risk sports include those that use a rapidly moving ball
or puck, bat, stick, racquet, or arrow (baseball, hockey, lacrosse, racquet sports, and archery) or involve aggressive body contact (football
and basketball). Related to both risk and frequency of participation, the
highest percentage of eye injuries are in basketball and baseball.
Protective eyewear, designed for a specific activity, is available for
most sports. For basketball, racquet sports, and other recreational
activities that do not require a helmet or face mask, molded polycarbonate sports goggles that are secured to the head by an elastic strap
are suggested. For hockey, football, lacrosse, and baseball (batter),
specific helmets with polycarbonate face shields and guards are available. Children should also wear sports goggles under their helmets.
For baseball, goggles and helmets should be worn for batting, catching, and base running; goggles alone are usually sufficient for other
positions.

The Ear
Chapter 676

General Considerations
and Evaluation of the Ear
Joseph Haddad Jr.
CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Diseases of the ear and temporal bone typically manifest with one or
more of eight clinical signs and symptoms.
Otalgia usually is associated with inflammation of the middle ear
(about 50% of cases) or external ear, but it can represent pain referred from
involvement of the teeth, temporomandibular joint, or pharynx (Table
676.1). In young infants, pulling or rubbing the ear along with general irritability or poor sleep, especially when associated with fever, may be the
only signs of ear pain. Ear pulling alone is not diagnostic of ear pathology.
Purulent otorrhea is a sign of otitis externa, otitis media (OM) with
perforation of the tympanic membrane (TM), drainage from the middle ear through a patent tympanostomy tube, or, rarely, drainage from a
first branchial cleft sinus. Bloody drainage may be associated with acute
or chronic inflammation (often with granulation tissue and/or an ear
tube), trauma, neoplasm, foreign body, or blood dyscrasia. Clear drainage suggests a perforation of the TM with a serous middle-­ear effusion
or, rarely, a cerebrospinal fluid leak draining through defects (congenital or traumatic) in the external auditory canal or from the middle ear.
Hearing loss results either from disease of the external or middle ear
(conductive hearing loss) or from pathology in the inner ear, retrocochlear structures, or central auditory pathways (sensorineural hearing
loss [SNHL]); the underlying etiology can be genetic or nongenetic,
syndromic or nonsyndromic, or idiopathic. The most common cause
of hearing loss in children is OM.
Swelling around the ear most commonly is a result of inflammation
(e.g., external otitis, perichondritis, mastoiditis), trauma (e.g., hematoma), benign cystic masses, or neoplasm.
Vertigo is a specific type of dizziness that is defined as any illusion
or sensation of motion. Dizziness is less specific than vertigo and refers
to a sensation of altered orientation in space. Vertigo is an uncommon
complaint in children; the child or parent might not volunteer information about balance unless asked specifically. The most common
cause of dizziness in young children is eustachian tube–middle-­ear
disease, but true vertigo also may be caused by labyrinthitis, perilymphatic fistula between the inner and middle ear as a result of trauma or
a congenital inner ear defect, cholesteatoma in the mastoid or middle
ear, vestibular neuronitis, benign paroxysmal vertigo, Meniere disease,
or disease of the central nervous system. Older children might describe
a feeling of the room spinning or turning; younger children might
express the dysequilibrium only by falling, stumbling, or clumsiness.
Nystagmus may be unidirectional, horizontal, or jerk nystagmus. It
is vestibular in origin and usually is associated with vertigo.
Tinnitus rarely is described spontaneously by children, but it is
common, especially in patients with eustachian tube–middle-­ear disease or SNHL. Children can describe tinnitus if asked directly about it,
including laterality and the quality of the sound.

FACIAL PARALYSIS

The facial nerve may be dehiscent in its course through the middle ear
as a normal variant in as many as 50% of people. Infection with local

PART

XXVIII
inflammation, most commonly in acute OM, can lead to a temporary
paralysis of the facial nerve. It also can result from Lyme disease, cholesteatoma, Bell palsy, Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus),
fracture, neoplasm, or infection of the temporal bone. Congenital facial
paralysis can result from birth trauma or congenital abnormality of the
seventh nerve or from a syndrome such as Möbius or CHARGE (coloboma, heart defects, atresia choanae, retarded growth, genital hypoplasia, and ear anomalies), or it may be associated with other cranial nerve
abnormalities and craniofacial anomalies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

Complete examination with special attention to the head and neck can
reveal a condition that can predispose to or be associated with ear disease in children. The facial appearance and the character of speech can
give clues to an abnormality of the ear or hearing. Many craniofacial
anomalies, such as cleft palate, mandibulofacial dysostosis (Treacher
Collins syndrome), and trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), are associated
with disorders of the ear and eustachian tube. Mouth breathing and
hyponasality can indicate intranasal or postnasal obstruction. Hypernasality is a sign of velopharyngeal insufficiency. Examining the oropharyngeal cavity might uncover an overt cleft palate or a submucous
cleft (usually associated with a bifid uvula), both of which predispose to
OM with effusion. A nasopharyngeal tumor with nasal and eustachian
tube blockage may be associated with OM.
The position of the patient for examination of the ear, nose, and throat
depends on the patient’s age and ability to cooperate, the clinical setting,
and the examiner’s preference. The child can be examined on an examination table or on the parent’s lap. The presence of a parent or assistant
usually is necessary to minimize movement and provide better examination results. An examining table may be desirable for uncooperative
older infants or when a procedure, such as microscopic evaluation or
tympanocentesis, is performed. Lap examination is adequate in most
infants and young children; the parent may assist in restraining the child
by folding the child’s wrists and arms over the child’s own abdomen with
one hand and holding the child’s head against the parent’s chest with the
other hand. If necessary, the child’s legs can be held between the parent’s
knees. To avoid ear trauma with movement, the examiner should hold
the otoscope with the hand placed firmly against the child’s head or face,
so that the otoscope moves with the head. Pulling up and out on the
pinna straightens the ear canal and allows better exposure of the TM.
When examining the ear, inspecting the auricle and external auditory meatus for infection can aid in evaluating complications of OM.
External otitis can result from acute OM with discharge, or inflammation of the posterior auricular area can indicate a periostitis or subperiosteal abscess extending from the mastoid air cells. The presence
of preauricular pits or skin tags also should be noted because affected
children have a slightly higher incidence of SNHL; ear pits can develop
chronic infection.
Cerumen is a protective, waxy, water-­repellent coating in the ear
canal that can interfere with examination. Cerumen usually is removed
using the surgical head of the otoscope, which allows passage of a
wire loop or a blunt curette under direct visualization. Other methods
include gentle irrigation of the ear canal with warm water, which should
be performed only if the TM is intact, or instillation of a solution such
as diluted hydrogen peroxide in the ear canal (with intact TM only) for
a few minutes to soften the wax for suction removal or irrigation. Commercial preparations such as trolamine polypeptide oleate–condensate
(Cerumenex) may cause dermatitis of the external canal with chronic
use and should be used only under a physician’s supervision.
Inflammation of the ear canal with associated pain often indicates
external otitis. Abnormalities of the external auditory canal include

stenosis (common in children with trisomy 21), bony exostoses, otorrhea, and the presence of foreign bodies. Cholesteatoma of the middle
ear can manifest in the canal as intermittent foul-­smelling drainage,
sometimes associated with white debris; cholesteatoma of the external
canal can appear as a white, pearl-­like mass in the canal skin. White or
gray debris of the canal suggests fungal external otitis. Newborn ear

canals are filled with vernix caseosa, which is soft and pale yellow and
should disappear shortly after birth.
The TM and its mobility are best assessed with a pneumatic otoscope. The normal TM is in a neutral position; a bulging TM may be
caused by increased middle-­ear air pressure, with or without pus or
effusion in the middle ear; a bulging drum can obscure visualization of
the malleus and annulus. Retraction of the TM usually indicates negative middle-­ear pressure, but it also can result from previous middle-­
ear disease with fixation of the ossicles, ossicular ligaments, or TM.
When retraction is present, the bony malleus appears more prominent,
and the incus may be more visible posterior to the malleus.
The normal TM has a silvery gray, “waxed paper” appearance. A white
or yellow TM can indicate a middle-­ear effusion. A red TM alone might
not indicate pathology, because the blood vessels of the membrane may
be engorged as a result of crying, sneezing, or nose blowing, though hemorrhagic redness is associated with acute OM. A normal TM is translucent, allowing the observer to visualize the middle-­ear landmarks: incus,
promontory, round window niche, and often the chorda tympani nerve. If
a middle-­ear effusion is present, an air-­fluid level or bubbles may be visible (Fig. 676.1). Inability to visualize the middle-­ear structures indicates
opacification of the drum, usually caused by thickening of the TM or a
middle-­ear effusion or both. Assessment of the light reflex often is not
helpful, because a middle ear with effusion reflects light as well as a normal
ear. Bullae (blister of the TM) formation is associated with acute OM.
TM mobility is helpful in assessing middle-­ear pressures and the
presence or absence of fluid (see Fig. 676.1). To best perform pneumatic otoscopy, a speculum of adequate size is used to obtain a good
seal and allow air movement in the canal. A rubber ring around the tip
of the speculum can help obtain a better canal seal. Normal middle-­ear
pressure is characterized by a neutral TM position and brisk TM movement to both positive and negative pressures.
Eardrum retraction is most common when negative middle-­ear
pressure is present; with even moderate negative middle-­ear pressure,
there is no visible inward movement with applied positive pressure in
the ear canal. However, negative canal pressure, which is produced by
releasing the rubber bulb of the pneumatic otoscope, can cause the TM
to bounce out toward the neutral position. The TM can retract in both
the presence and absence of middle-­ear fluid, and if the middle-­ear
fluid is mixed with air, the TM might still have some mobility. Outward
eardrum movement is less likely in the presence of severe negative
middle-­ear pressure or middle-­ear effusion.
The TM that exhibits fullness (bulging) moves to applied positive
pressure but not to applied negative pressure if the pressure within
the middle ear is positive. A full TM and positive middle-­ear pressure
without an effusion may be seen in young infants who are crying during the otoscopic examination, in older infants and children with nasal
obstruction, and in the early stage of acute OM. When the middle-­
ear–mastoid air cell system is filled with an effusion and little or no
air is present, the mobility of the TM is severely decreased or absent in
response to both applied positive and negative pressures.
Tympanocentesis, or aspiration of the middle ear, is the definitive
(but not usually needed) method of verifying the presence and type of
a middle-­ear effusion and is performed by inserting an 18-­gauge spinal
needle attached to a syringe or a collection trap through the inferior
portion of the TM (Fig. 676.2). Culturing of the ear canal and alcohol
cleansing should precede tympanocentesis and culture of the middle-­
ear aspirate; a canal culture is taken first to help determine whether
organisms cultured from the middle ear are contaminants from the
external canal or true middle-­ear pathogens.
Further diagnostic studies of the ear and hearing include audiometric evaluation, impedance audiometry (tympanometry), acoustic
reflectometry, and specialized eustachian tube function studies. Diagnostic imaging studies, including CT and MRI, often provide further
information about anatomic abnormalities and the extent of inflammatory processes or neoplasms. Specialized assessment of labyrinthine
function should be considered in the evaluation of a child with a suspected vestibular disorder (see Chapter 682).

the world’s population, including 32 million children) have disabling
hearing loss. An additional 364 million people have mild hearing loss.
Half of these cases could have been prevented. In the United States, the
average incidence of neonatal hearing loss is 1.6 per 1,000 infants; the
rate by state varies from 0.22 to 3.61 per 1,000. Among children and
adolescents, the prevalence of mild or greater hearing loss is 3.1% and
is higher among persons from lower-­income families.
Onset of hearing loss in children can occur at any time in childhood.
When less severe hearing loss or the transient hearing loss that commonly accompanies middle-­ear disease in young children is considered, the number of affected children increases substantially.

INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE

Bilateral neural hearing loss is categorized as mild (20-­30 dB hearing
level [HL]), moderate (30-­50 dB HL), moderately severe (50-­70 dB
HL), severe (75-­85 dB HL), or profound (>85 dB). The World Health
Organization estimates that approximately 360 million people (5% of

TYPES OF HEARING LOSS

Hearing loss can be peripheral or central in origin. Peripheral hearing
loss can be conductive, sensorineural, or mixed. Conductive hearing
loss (CHL) is the most common type of hearing loss in children and
occurs when sound transmission is physically impeded in the external and/or middle ear, most commonly by otitis media (OM) with
effusion. Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is caused by damage to
or maldevelopment of structures of the inner ear, including hair cell
destruction, cochlear malformation; perilymphatic fistula of the round
or oval window membrane, and failure in development or lesions of
the acoustic division of the eighth nerve. Coexistent CHL and SNHL is
considered a mixed hearing loss.
An auditory deficit originating along the central auditory nervous
system pathways from the proximal eighth nerve to the cerebral cortex
usually is considered central (or retrocochlear) hearing loss. Tumors
or demyelinating disease of the eighth nerve and cerebellopontine angle
can cause hearing deficits but spare the outer, middle, and inner ear.
These causes of hearing loss are rare in children. Functional disorders of
the eighth nerve and/or brainstem pathways may manifest in a variety of
clinical defects known collectively as auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) or auditory dyssynchrony, without abnormalities demonstrable on imaging. Other forms of central auditory deficits, known as
central auditory processing disorders, include those that make it difficult even for children with normal hearing sensitivity to listen selectively
in the presence of noise, to combine information from the two ears properly, to process speech when it is slightly degraded, and to integrate auditory information when it is delivered faster, although they can process it
when delivered at a slow rate. These deficits can manifest as specific language disorders or poor attention or as academic or behavior problems

in school. Strategies for coping with such disorders are available for older
children, and identification and documentation of the central auditory
processing disorder allow parents and teachers to make appropriate
accommodations to enhance learning.

ETIOLOGY

Most CHL is acquired, with middle-­ear fluid the most common cause.
Congenital causes include anomalies of the pinna, external ear canal,
tympanic membrane (TM), and ossicles. Rarely congenital cholesteatoma or other masses in the middle ear manifest as CHL. TM perforation (e.g., trauma, OM), ossicular discontinuity (e.g., infection,
cholesteatoma, trauma), tympanosclerosis, acquired cholesteatoma, or
masses in the ear canal or middle ear (Langerhans cell histiocytosis,
salivary gland tumors, glomus tumors, rhabdomyosarcoma) also can
manifest as CHL. Uncommon diseases that affect the middle ear and
temporal bone and can manifest with CHL include otosclerosis, osteopetrosis, fibrous dysplasia, and osteogenesis imperfecta. Rare autoimmune or inflammatory syndromes may include hearing loss. Susac
syndrome is manifest as a subacute encephalopathy, visual impairment, and hearing loss. Cogan syndrome presents with interstitial
keratitis, sudden hearing loss, and vestibular impairment.
SNHL may be congenital or acquired. Acquired SNHL may be
caused by genetic, infectious, autoimmune, anatomic, traumatic, ototoxic, and idiopathic factors (Tables 677.1-­677.4). The recognized risk
factors account for approximately 50% of cases of moderate to profound SNHL.

Infectious Causes

The most common infectious cause of congenital SNHL is cytomegalovirus (CMV), which infects 1 in 100 newborns in the United
States (see Chapters 149 and 302). Of these, 6,000-­8,000 infants each
year have clinical manifestations, including approximately 75% with
SNHL. Congenital CMV warrants special attention because it is associated with hearing loss in its symptomatic and asymptomatic forms
with bilateral and unilateral hearing loss, respectively; the hearing
loss may be progressive. Some children with congenital CMV have
suddenly lost residual hearing at 4-­5 years of age. Much less common congenital infectious causes of SNHL include toxoplasmosis
and syphilis. Congenital CMV, toxoplasmosis, and syphilis also can
manifest with delayed onset of SNHL months to years after birth.
Rubella, once the most common viral cause of congenital SNHL, is
very uncommon because of effective vaccination programs. In utero
infection with herpes simplex virus is rare, and hearing loss is not an
isolated manifestation.
Other postnatal infectious causes of SNHL include neonatal group
B streptococcal sepsis and bacterial meningitis at any age. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis that
results in SNHL after the neonatal period and has become less common with the routine administration of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Haemophilus influenzae type b, once the most common cause of
meningitis resulting in SNHL, is rare owing to the H. influenzae type
b conjugate vaccine. Uncommon infectious causes of SNHL include
Lyme disease, parvovirus B19, and varicella. Mumps, rubella, and
measles, all once common causes of SNHL in children, are rare owing
to vaccination programs. When these infectious etiologies occur, the
resulting hearing loss is frequently bilateral and severe.

Genetic Causes

Genetic causes of SNHL probably are responsible for as many as 50% of
SNHL cases (see Tables 677.3 and 677.4). These disorders may be associated with other abnormalities, may be part of a named syndrome, or
can exist in isolation. SNHL often occurs with abnormalities of the ear
and eye and with disorders of the metabolic, musculoskeletal, integumentary, renal, and nervous systems.
Autosomal dominant hearing losses account for approximately
10% of all cases of childhood SNHL. Waardenburg (types I and II) and
branchiootorenal syndromes represent two of the most common autosomal dominant syndromic types of SNHL. Types of SNHL are coded
with a four-­letter code and a number, as follows: DFN = deafness, A =

SNHL. Usher syndrome (types 1, 2, and 3: all associated with blindness
and retinitis pigmentosa), Pendred syndrome, and Jervell and Lange-­
Nielsen syndrome (one form of long QT syndrome) are three of the
most common syndromic recessive types of SNHL. Other autosomal
recessive conditions include Alström syndrome, type 4 Bartter syndrome, biotinidase deficiency, and DFNB 1-­18, 20-­23, 26-­27, 29-­33,
35-­40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 49, 53, and 55.
Unlike children with an easily identified syndrome or with anomalies of the outer ear, who may be identified as being at risk for hearing loss and consequently monitored, children with nonsyndromic
hearing loss present greater diagnostic difficulty. Pathogenic variants of the connexin-­26 and -­30 genes are identified in autosomal
recessive (DNFB 1) and autosomal dominant (DNFA 3) SNHL and
in sporadic patients with nonsyndromic SNHL; up to 50% of nonsyndromic SNHLs may be related to a pathogenic variation of connexin­26. Pathologic variants of the GJB2 gene co-localize with DFNA 3
and DFNB 1 loci on chromosome 13, are associated with autosomal
nonsyndromic susceptibility to deafness, and are associated with as
many as 30% of cases of sporadic severe to profound congenital deafness and 50% of cases of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness. In addition, pathogenic variants in GJB6 are associated with
approximately 5% of recessive nonsyndromic deafness. Sex-­linked
disorders associated with SNHL, thought to account for 1–2% of
SNHLs, include Norrie disease, otopalatal digital syndrome, Nance
deafness, and Alport syndrome. Chromosomal abnormalities such as
trisomy 13-­15, trisomy 18, and trisomy 21 also can be accompanied
by hearing impairment. Patients with Turner syndrome have monosomy for all or part of one X chromosome and can have CHL, SNHL,
or mixed hearing loss. The hearing loss may be progressive. Mitochondrial genetic abnormalities (MELAS, MERRF) also can result in
SNHL (see Table 677.3).
Many genetically determined causes of hearing impairment, both
syndromic and nonsyndromic, do not express themselves until sometime after birth. Alport, Alström, Down, and Hunter-­Hurler syndromes and von Recklinghausen disease are genetic diseases that can
have SNHL as a late manifestation.

Physical Causes

Agenesis or malformation of cochlear structures may be genetic; these
include Scheibe, Mondini (Fig. 677.1), Alexander, and Michel anomalies, enlarged vestibular aqueducts (in isolation or associated with

Pendred syndrome), and semicircular canal anomalies. These anomalies most likely develop before the eighth week of gestation and result
from arrest in normal development, aberrant development, or both.
Many of these anomalies also have been described in association with
other congenital conditions such as intrauterine CMV and rubella
infections. These abnormalities are quite common; in as many as 20%
of children with SNHL, obvious or subtle temporal bone abnormalities
are seen on high-­resolution CT scanning or MRI.
Conditions, diseases, or syndromes that include craniofacial abnormalities may be associated with CHL and possibly with SNHL. Pierre
Robin sequence, Stickler syndrome, and Treacher Collins, Klippel-­Feil,
Crouzon, and branchiootorenal syndromes and osteogenesis imperfecta often are associated with hearing loss. Congenital anomalies
causing CHL include malformations of the ossicles and middle-­ear
structures and atresia of the external auditory canal.
SNHL also can occur secondary to exposure to toxins, chemicals,
antimicrobials, and noise exposure. Early in pregnancy, the embryo
is particularly vulnerable to the effects of toxic substances. Ototoxic
drugs, including aminoglycosides, loop diuretics, and chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin) also can cause SNHL. Congenital SNHL can occur
secondary to exposure to these drugs as well as to thalidomide and
retinoids. Certain chemicals, such as quinine, lead, and arsenic, can
cause hearing loss both prenatally and postnatally. Among adolescents,
the use of personal listening devices at high volume settings has been
found to be correlated with hearing loss.
Trauma, including temporal bone fractures, inner ear concussion,
head trauma, iatrogenic trauma (e.g., surgery, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), radiation exposure, and noise, also can cause
SNHL. Other uncommon causes of SNHL in children include autoimmune disease (systemic or limited to the inner ear), metabolic abnormalities, and neoplasms of the temporal bone.

EFFECTS OF HEARING IMPAIRMENT

The effects of hearing impairment depend on the nature and degree
of the hearing loss and on the individual characteristics of the child.
Hearing loss may be unilateral or bilateral, conductive, sensorineural, or mixed; mild, moderate, severe, or profound; of sudden or
gradual onset; stable, progressive, or fluctuating; and affecting a
part or all of the audible spectrum. Other factors, such as intelligence, medical or physical condition (including accompanying syndromes), family support, age at onset, age at time of identification,
and promptness of intervention, also affect the impact of hearing
loss on a child (see Chapter 55).
Most hearing-­impaired children have some useable hearing. Only
6% of those in the hearing-­impaired population have bilateral profound
hearing loss. Hearing loss very early in life can affect the development
of speech and language, social and emotional development, behavior,
attention, and academic achievement. Some cases of hearing impairment are misdiagnosed because affected children have sufficient hearing to respond to environmental sounds and can learn some speech
and language but when challenged in the classroom cannot perform
to full potential.
Even mild or unilateral hearing loss can have a detrimental effect
on the development of a young child and on school performance.
Children with such hearing impairments have greater difficulty when
listening conditions are unfavorable (e.g., background noise and
poor acoustics), as can occur in a classroom. The fact that schools
are auditory-­verbal environments is unappreciated by those who
minimize the impact of hearing impairment on learning. Hearing
loss should be considered in any child with speech and language difficulties or below-­par performance, poor behavior, or inattention in
school (Table 677.5).
Children with moderate, severe, or profound hearing impairment and
those with other impairing conditions often are educated in classes or
schools for children with special needs. There is a strong trend toward
integrating a child with hearing loss into the least restrictive learning
environment; this approach can only be successful if there are sufficient
supportive services available for auditory and other learning needs. The
auditory management and choices regarding modes of communication

and education for children with hearing impairments must be individualized, because these children are not a homogeneous group. A team
approach to individual case management is essential because each child
and family unit have unique needs and abilities (see Chapter 55).

HEARING SCREENING

Hearing impairment can have a major impact on a child’s development,
and because early identification improves prognosis, screening programs have been widely and strongly advocated. The National Center
for Hearing Assessment and Management estimates that the detection
and treatment at birth of hearing loss saves $400,000 per child in special education costs; screening costs approximately $8-­$50/child. Data

from the Colorado newborn screening program suggest that if hearing-­
impaired infants are identified and treated by age 6 months, these children (with the exception of those with bilateral profound impairment)
should develop the same level of language as their age-­matched peers
who are not hearing impaired. These data provide compelling support
for establishing mandated newborn hearing screening programs for all
children. The American Academy of Pediatrics endorses the goal of
universal detection of hearing loss in infants before 3 months of age,
with appropriate intervention no later than 6 months of age. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that of the approximately 4 million infants born in the United States in 2014, 97.9% were
screened for hearing loss.

Hearing screening is mandated in at least 45 states, but until screening programs are universally mandated, some hospitals will continue
to use other criteria to screen for hearing loss. Some use the high-­risk
criteria (see Table 677.1) to decide which infants to screen, some screen
all infants who require intensive care, and some do both. The problem with using high-­risk criteria to screen is that 50% of cases of hearing impairment will be missed, either because the infants are hearing
impaired but do not meet any of the high-­risk criteria or because they
develop hearing loss after the neonatal period.
The recommended hearing screening techniques are either otoacoustic emissions (OAE) testing or auditory brainstem evoked
responses (ABRs). The ABR test, an auditory evoked electrophysiologic
response that correlates highly with hearing, has been used successfully and cost-­effectively to screen newborns and to identify further
the degree and type of hearing loss. OAE tests, used successfully in
most universal newborn screening programs, are quick, easy to administer, and inexpensive, and they provide a sensitive indication of the

presence of hearing loss. Results are relatively easy to interpret. OAE
tests elicit no response if hearing is worse than 30-­40 dB, no matter
what the cause; children who fail OAE tests undergo an ABR for a more
definitive evaluation, as ABR has a higher sensitivity and specificity.
It is recommended that both OAE measurement and ABR screening
be used in the intensive care unit setting. Screening methods such as
observing behavioral responses to uncalibrated noisemakers or using
automated systems such as the Crib-­o-­gram (Canon) or the auditory
response cradle (in which movement of the infant in response to sound
is recorded by motion sensors) are not recommended.
Many children become hearing impaired after the neonatal period
and therefore are not identified by newborn screening programs. Often
it is not until children are in preschool or kindergarten that further
hearing screening takes place; an evidence-­based systematic review
has identified pure-­tone and OAE screening to be effective, with pure-­
tone screening having higher sensitivity. Among adolescents, high-­
frequency hearing loss is associated with exposure to loud noises, so

The impact of hearing impairment is greatest on an infant who has yet
to develop language; consequently, identification, diagnosis, description, and treatment should begin as soon as possible. Infants with a
prenatal or perinatal history that puts them at risk (see Table 677.3) or
those who have failed a formal hearing screening should be evaluated
by an experienced clinical audiologist until a reliable assessment of
auditory sensitivity has been obtained. Primary care clinicians should
encourage families to cooperate with the follow-­up plan. Infants who
are born at risk but who were not screened as neonates (e.g., because of
transfer from one hospital to another) should have a hearing screening
by age 3 months.
Hearing-­impaired infants who are born at risk or are screened for
hearing loss in a neonatal hearing screening program account for
only a portion of hearing-­impaired children. Children who are congenitally deaf because of autosomal recessive inheritance or subclinical congenital infection often are not identified until 1-­3 years
of age. Usually those with more severe hearing loss are identified
at an earlier age, but identification often occurs later than the age
at which intervention can provide an optimal outcome, especially
in countries lacking technologic resources. Children who hear normally develop extensive receptive and expressive language by 3 years
of age (Table 677.6) and exhibit behavior reflecting normal auditory

function (Table 677.7). Failure to fulfill these criteria should be the
reason for an audiologic evaluation. Parents’ concern about hearing
and any delayed development of speech and language should alert
the pediatrician, because parents’ concern usually precedes formal
identification and diagnosis of hearing impairment by 6-­12 months.

CLINICAL AUDIOLOGIC EVALUATION

When hearing impairment is suspected in a young child, reliable
and valid estimates of auditory function can be obtained using electrophysiologic and age-­appropriate behavioral measurement. Successful treatment strategies for hearing-­impaired children rely on
prompt identification and ongoing assessment to define the dimensions of auditory function. Cooperation among primary care providers and specialists in areas such as audiology, speech and language
pathology, education, and child development is necessary to optimize auditory-­verbal development. Therapy for hearing-­impaired
children may include an amplification device, a frequency modulation (FM) system in the classroom, close monitoring of hearing and
auditory skills, speech and language therapy, counseling of parents
and families, advising teachers, and dealing with public agencies.

Audiometry

Audiologic evaluation technique varies as a function of the age and
developmental level of the child, the reason for the evaluation, and
the child’s otologic condition or history. An audiogram provides the
fundamental description of hearing sensitivity (Fig. 677.3). Hearing
thresholds are assessed as a function of frequency using pure tones
(single-­frequency stimuli) at octave intervals from 250 to 8,000 Hz.
When the child is old enough to accept their placement, earphones
typically are used to assess each ear independently. Before this stage,
testing may be performed in a sound-­treated environment with stimuli
delivered via speakers; this approach permits description only of the
better-­hearing ear.
Air-­conducted signals are presented through earphones (or
loudspeakers) and are used to provide information about the sensitivity of the entire auditory system. These same test sounds can

Speech-­Recognition Threshold

Another measure useful for describing auditory function is the
speech-­recognition threshold (SRT), which is the lowest intensity
level at which a score of approximately 50% correct is obtained on
a task of recognizing spondee words. Spondee words are 2-­syllable
words or phrases that have equal stress on each syllable, such as
baseball, hotdog, and pancake. Listeners must be familiar with all
the words for a valid test result to be obtained. The SRT should correspond to the average of pure-­tone thresholds at 500, 1,000, and
2,000 Hz, the pure-­tone average. The SRT is relevant as an indicator of a child’s potential for development and use of speech and
language; it also serves as a check of the validity of a test because
children with nonorganic hearing loss (malingerers) might show a
discrepancy between the pure-­tone average and SRT. An SRT may
be obtained in a child with expressive speech or language limitations
using modified techniques, such as picture-­pointing responses.
The basic battery of hearing tests concludes with an assessment of
a child’s ability to understand monosyllabic words when presented at
a comfortable listening level. Performance on such word recognition
tests assists in the differential diagnosis of hearing impairment and
provides a measure of how well a child performs when speech is presented at loudness levels similar to those encountered in conversation.
For speech recognition as well, a picture-­pointing response may be
obtained with standardized tests.

be delivered to the ear through an oscillator that is placed on the
head, usually on the mastoid. Such signals are considered bone-­
conducted because the bones of the skull transmit vibrations as
sound energy directly to the inner ear, essentially bypassing the
outer and middle ears. In a normal ear, and also in children with
SNHL, the air-­and bone-­conduction thresholds are equivalent.
In those with CHL, bone-­conduction thresholds are more sensitive than air-­conducted responses; this is called the air-­b one gap,
which indicates the amount of hearing loss attributable to dysfunction in the outer and/or middle ear. In mixed hearing loss, both
the bone-­and air-­conduction thresholds are abnormal, and there is
additionally an air-­bone gap.

Hearing testing technique is age dependent. For children at or
above the developmental level of a 5-­to 6-­year-­old, conventional
test methods can be used. For children 30 months to 5 years of age,
play audiometry can be used. Responses in play audiometry usually are conditioned motor activities associated with a game, such as
dropping blocks in a bucket, placing rings on a peg, or completing
a puzzle. The technique can be used to obtain a reliable audiogram
for a preschool child.

For children between the ages of about 6 and 30 months, visual
reinforcement audiometry (VRA) is commonly used. In this technique, the child is conditioned to turn the head in response to a
tonal signal from a speaker in the same location as an animated
(mechanical) toy or video reinforcer. If infants are properly conditioned, by presenting sounds associated with the reinforcer, VRA
can provide reliable estimates of hearing sensitivity for tonal signals
and speech sounds. In most applications of VRA, sounds are presented by loudspeakers in a sound field, so ear-­specific information
is not obtained. Assessment of an infant often is designed to rule out
hearing loss that would be sufficient to affect the development of
speech and language. Normal sound-­field response levels of infants
indicate sufficient hearing for this purpose despite the possibility
of different HLs in the two ears. When ear-­specific information
is needed in this age-­group, the ABR is conducted under sleep-­
deprived or sedated conditions.

responses to complex (not frequency-­specific) test sounds such as
warble tones, narrow-­band noise, speech, or music presented using
calibrated signals from a loudspeaker. Response levels can vary widely
within and among infants and usually do not provide a reliable estimate of hearing sensitivity. The types of responses observed during this
testing may include alterations in sucking behavior, initiation or cessation in crying, pupillary dilatation, and alterations in respiration.
Assessment of a child with suspected hearing loss is not complete
until pure-­tone hearing thresholds and SRTs (a reliable audiogram)
have been obtained in each ear. Behavioral observation audiometry
and VRA in sound-­field testing give estimates of hearing responsivity
in the better-­hearing ear. When significant hearing loss is suspected in
infants, electrophysiologic assessments must be conducted to permit
early intervention.

Acoustic Immittance Testing

Acoustic immittance testing is a standard part of the clinical audiologic test battery and includes tympanometry, acoustic reflex threshold
measurement, and acoustic reflex decay testing. It is a useful objective
assessment technique that provides information about the status of the
TM, middle ear, and acoustic reflex arc. Tympanometry can be performed in a physician’s office and is helpful in the diagnosis and management of OM with effusion, a common cause of mild to moderate
hearing loss in young children.

Tympanometry

Tympanometry provides a graph (tympanogram) of the middle ear’s
ability to transmit sound energy (admittance or compliance) or impede
sound energy (impedance) as a function of air pressure in the external
ear canal. Because most immittance test instruments measure acoustic
admittance, the term admittance is used here. The principles apply to
whatever units of measurement are used.
A probe is inserted into the entrance of the external ear canal so
that an airtight seal is obtained. A manometer in the probe varies
air pressure, while a sound generator presents a tone, and a microphone measures the sound pressure level reflected back. The sound
pressure measured in the ear canal relative to the known intensity
of the probe signal is used to estimate the acoustic admittance of
the ear canal and middle-­ear system. Admittance can be expressed
in a unit called a millimho (mmho) or as a volume of air (mL)
with equivalent acoustic admittance. Additionally, an estimate can
be made of the volume of air enclosed between the probe tip and
TM. The acoustic admittance of this volume of air is deducted from
the overall admittance measure to obtain a measure of the admittance of the middle-­ear system alone. Estimating ear canal volume
also has a diagnostic benefit, because an abnormally large value is
consistent with the presence of an opening in the TM (perforation,
pressure equalization tube, or surgical defect).
Once the admittance of the air mass in the external auditory canal
has been eliminated, it is assumed that the remaining admittance
measure accurately reflects the admittance of the entire middle-­ear
system. Its value is controlled largely by the dynamics of the TM.
Abnormalities of the TM can dictate the shape of tympanograms,
thus obscuring abnormalities medial to the TM. In addition, the
frequency of the probe tone, the speed and direction of the air
pressure change, and the air pressure at which the tympanogram
is initiated can all influence the outcome. The effect of the probe
tone frequency is well documented, and in young children (<4-­6
months) with small ear canals, use of a high-­f requency probe tone,
either 678 or 1,000 Hz, is recommended.
When air pressure in the ear canal is equal to that in the middle
ear, the middle-­ear system is functioning optimally. That is, the pressure equalization function of the eustachian tube permits the middle
ear to rest at atmospheric pressure, equivalent to the condition in the
ear canal. Therefore the ear canal pressure at which there is the greatest flow of energy (admittance) should be a reasonable estimate of
the air pressure in the middle-­ear space. This pressure is determined
by finding the maximum or peak admittance on the tympanogram
and obtaining its value on the x axis. The value on the y axis at the

tympanogram peak is an estimate of peak admittance based on admittance tympanometry (Table 677.8). This peak measure sometimes is
referred to as static acoustic admittance, even though it is estimated
from a dynamic measure. Normative values for peak admittance as a
function of air pressure are well established.

Tympanometry in Otitis Media with Effusion

Children who have OM with effusion often have reduced peak
admittance or high negative tympanometric peak pressures (see Fig.
680.5C). However, in the diagnosis of effusion, the tympanometric
measure with the greatest sensitivity and specificity is the shape of
the tympanogram rather than its peak pressure or admittance. The
tympanogram is classified based on shape and peak admittance
location. The greater the stiffening of the TM and ME, the lower the
peak. As negative pressure within the middle ear increases, the peak
becomes more negatively displaced. The more rounded the peak
(or, in an absent peak, a flat tympanogram), the higher is the probability that an effusion is present (see Fig. 680.5B). The stage of OM
may affect the tympanometric findings. An immobile TM/ME system based on significant effusion, as reflected in flat tympanogram,
may evolve into findings of negative ME pressure and later positive
pressure as the OM resolves, returning to a normal tympanogram.

Acoustic Reflex Threshold Test

The acoustic reflex threshold test also is part of the immittance test
battery. With a properly functioning middle-­ear system, admittance
at the TM decreases due to the stiffening action of the middle ear
muscles (stapedius and, to a lesser extent, tensor tympani). In healthy
ears, the stapedial reflex occurs after exposure to loud sounds as a
protective mechanism. Admittance instruments are designed to present reflex-­activating signals (pure tones of various frequencies or
noise), either to the same ear or the contralateral ear, while measuring the concomitant changes in admittance. Very small admittance
changes that are time locked to presentations of the signal are considered to be a result of middle-­ear muscle reflexes. Admittance changes
may be absent when the hearing loss is sufficient to prevent the signal
from reaching the loudness level necessary to elicit the reflex or when
a middle-­ear condition affects HLs or introduces sufficient stiffening
to obscure reading the reflex activity. The acoustic reflex test also is
used in the assessment of SNHL and the integrity of the neurologic
components of the reflex arc, including crossed and uncrossed activity of cranial nerves VII and VIII.

ear-­specific information in young children, and test children who
cannot, for whatever reason, cooperate with behavioral test methods. It also is important in the diagnosis of auditory dysfunction
(i.e., estimation of hearing thresholds) and of disorders of the
auditory nervous system. The ABR test is a far-­field recording of
minute electrical discharges from numerous neurons. The stimulus
therefore must be able to cause synchronous discharge of the large
numbers of neurons involved. Stimuli with very rapid onset, such as
clicks or tone bursts, must be used. Unfortunately, the rapid onset
required to create a measurable ABR also causes energy to be spread
in the frequency domain, reducing the frequency specificity of the
response.
The ABR result is not affected by sedation or general anesthesia.
Infants and children from about 4 months to 4 years of age routinely
are sedated to minimize electrical interference caused by muscle activity during testing. The ABR also can be performed in the operating
room when a child is anesthetized for another procedure. Children
younger than 4 months of age might sleep for a long enough period
after feeding to allow an ABR to be done.
The ABR is recorded as 5-­7 waves. Waves I, III, and V can be obtained
consistently in all age-­groups; waves II and IV appear less consistently.
The latency of each wave (time of occurrence of the wave peak after
stimulus onset) increases and the amplitude decreases with reductions
in stimulus intensity; latency also decreases with increasing age, with
the earliest waves reaching mature latency values earlier in life than the
later waves. Age-­specific normative data have been obtained in several
studies.
The ABR test has two major uses in a pediatric setting. As an
audiometric test, it provides information on the ability of the
peripheral auditory system to transmit information to the auditory nerve and beyond. It also is used in the differential diagnosis
or monitoring of central nervous system pathology. For hearing
threshold estimation, the goal is to find the minimum stimulus
intensity that yields an observable ABR, generally relying on wave
V, the most robust aspect of morphology. Plotting latency versus
intensity for various waves also aids in the differential diagnosis of hearing impairment. A major advantage of auditory assessment using the ABR test is that ear-­specific threshold estimates can
be obtained on infants or patients who are difficult to test. ABR
thresholds using click stimuli correlate best with behavioral hearing
thresholds in the higher frequencies (1,000-­4,000 Hz); responsivity
in the low frequencies requires different stimuli (tone bursts/pips or
filtered clicks) or the use of masking, neither of which isolates the
low-­f requency region of the cochlea in all cases, and this can affect
interpretation.
The ABR test does not assess “hearing.” It reflects auditory neuronal electrical responses that can be correlated to behavioral hearing
thresholds, but a normal ABR result only suggests that the auditory
system, up to the level of the midbrain, is responsive to the stimulus
used. Conversely, a failure to elicit an ABR indicates an impairment of
the system’s synchronous response but does not necessarily mean that
there is no “hearing.” The behavioral response to sound sometimes is
normal when no ABR can be elicited, such as in neurologic demyelinating disease.
Hearing losses that are sudden, progressive, or unilateral are
indications for ABR testing. Although it is believed that the different waves of the ABR reflect activity in increasingly rostral levels
of the auditory system, the neural generators of the response have
not been precisely determined. Each ABR wave beyond the earliest waves probably is the result of neural firing at many levels of
the system, and each level of the system probably contributes to
several ABR waves. High-­intensity click stimuli are used for the
neurologic application. The morphology of the response and wave,
interwave latencies, and interaural latency differences are examined
with respect to age-­appropriate forms. Delayed or missing waves in
the ABR result often have diagnostic significance.
The ABR and other electrical responses are extremely complex and
difficult to interpret. A number of factors, including instrumentation

design and settings, environment, degree and configuration of hearing loss, and patients’ characteristics, can influence the quality of the
recording. Therefore testing and interpretation of electrophysiologic
activity as it possibly relates to hearing should be carried out by trained
audiologists to avoid the risk that unreliable or erroneous conclusions
will affect a patient’s care.

Otoacoustic Emissions

During normal hearing, OAEs originate from the outer hair cells
in the cochlea and are detected by sensitive amplifying processes.
They travel from the cochlea through the middle ear to the external
auditory canal, where they can be detected using miniature microphones. Transient evoked OAEs (TEOAEs) may be used to check
the integrity of the cochlea. In the neonatal period, detection of
OAEs can be accomplished during natural sleep, and TEOAEs can
be used as screening tests in infants and children for hearing down
to the 30 dB level of hearing loss. They are less time consuming and
elaborate than ABRs and may be used when behavioral tests cannot be accomplished. TEOAEs are reduced or absent owing to various dysfunctions in the middle and inner ears. They are absent in
patients with >30 dB of hearing loss and are not used to determine
the hearing threshold; rather, they provide a screen for whether
hearing is present at >30-­40 dB. CHL, such as OM or congenitally
abnormal middle-­ear structures, reduces the transfer of TEOAEs
and may be incorrectly interpreted as a cochlear hearing disorder. If
a hearing loss is suspected based on the absence of OAEs, the ears
should be examined for the evidence of pathology, tympanometry
should be conducted, and then ABR testing should be used for confirmation and identification of the type, degree, and laterality of
hearing loss.

TREATMENT

With widespread hearing screening within the United States, early
diagnosis and treatment of children with hearing loss are common.
Testing for hearing loss is possible even in very young children, and
it should be done if parents suspect a problem. Any child with a
known risk factor for hearing loss should be evaluated in the first 6
months of life.
Once a hearing loss is identified, a full developmental and speech
and language evaluation is needed. Counseling and involvement of
parents are required in all stages of the evaluation and treatment or
rehabilitation. A CHL often can be corrected through treatment of a
middle-­ear effusion (i.e., ear tube placement) or surgical correction of
the abnormal sound-­conducting mechanism. Dependent on the level
of hearing loss, children with SNHL should be evaluated for possible
hearing aid use by a pediatric audiologist. Current guidelines indicate
that within 1 month of diagnosis of SNHL, children should be fitted
with hearing aids, and hearing aids may be fitted for children as young
as 1 month of age. Compelling evidence from the hearing screening
program in Colorado shows that identification and amplification before
age 6 months make a very significant difference in the speech and language abilities of affected children compared with cases identified and
amplified after the age of 6 months. In these children, repeat audiologic
testing is needed to reliably identify the degree of hearing loss and to
fine-­tune the use of hearing aids. Hearing aids remain the rehabilitative
device of choice, in the context of an individually designed treatment
plan, for children with mild, moderate, or moderately severe CHL,
mixed HL, or SNHL. For children with severe or profound SNHL, a
trial with hearing aids is needed to determine if this approach is sufficient for the development of language; other options may need to be
explored if there are indications that speech and language are delayed
with a hearing aid in this HL group. Importantly, efficacy of hearing
aids depends on their consistent use. There is great variability in how
often children wear their hearing aids. Though there is no specific recommendation regarding the minimal number of hours per day that the
hearing aids should be worn, parents should be encouraged to have
their child use hearing aids full-­time in order to facilitate speech and
language development.

Chapter 677 u Hearing Loss 3993
When it is clear that hearing aids are not providing the auditory
stimulation needed to support language development, the parents
require counseling to consider alternative treatments. A cochlear
implant may be necessary to facilitate intelligible oral communication (i.e., oralism). This approach requires years of intensive speech
and language training and is dependent on providing the best possible auditory stimulation. This option is very attractive to parents
with hearing because it is the most familiar form of communication
to them. Although there is a heavy emphasis in the medical world
valuing the development of oral language (speech production), parents should also be provided with information about alternatives
such as sign language, total communication, and cued speech (see
Chapter 55). Each of these communication modalities has advantages and disadvantages. Sign language allows the child to develop
a language system early and can support academic training. The
consequence of this option is that the dominant hearing world does
not interact easily with users of sign language, and the child may
face significant challenges integrating into hearing society. Such
possibilities as academic success and college/graduate school training are not excluded by the use of sign language, but a narrower
set of venues may be available to accommodate the child’s learning needs. Whereas this option may be acceptable to deaf parents
already in the deaf community, many hearing parents are uncomfortable with this path for their child. This option also requires that
the parents become fluent in sign language.
Total communication is an educational philosophy in which
both sign and oral language as well as other forms of communication are encouraged. In theory, the two systems support and clarify
information transfer and enhance academic progress. Depending on the particular school and/or teachers, one system may be
emphasized over the other. Cued speech is an approach in which
the development of oral language is supported by a system of hand
gestures near the mouth and throat to disambiguate confusions that
result from lip reading alone. This system can be highly successful
in supporting spoken language and requires that parents become
fluent in the use of the cues. Other factors should be considered in
making the choice of communication modality. Significant comorbidities, such as visual impairment or other developmental delays,
may limit the ability of a child to derive benefit from some choices.
Support for the parents in making this decision may require counseling from an audiologist, social worker, deaf educator, and/or
psychologist. Organizations of parents of deaf children, such as
the A.G. Bell Association and the John Tracy Clinic, can provide a
wealth of support and information to parents in this process.
Infants and young children with profound congenital or prelingual onset of deafness have benefited from multichannel cochlear
implants (Fig. 677.4). Cochlear implants are systems that combine
internal (surgically implanted) and externally worn components.
These implants consist of 4 main components: the externals—which
include a microphone, a minicomputer sound (speech) processor,
and a transmitter—and the internal—an electrode array. These
implants bypass injury to the organ of Corti and provide neural
stimulation through the digitization of auditory stimuli into digital radiofrequency impulses. Specifically, sound is initially detected
by the microphone and then is processed by the speech processor.
The speech processor is programmed by an audiologist to implement the manufacturer’s proprietary speech processing strategies
that are highly sophisticated manipulations of the input signal. Signals from the speech processor are transmitted across the skin by
an FM signal to the internal receiver, which converts these signals
into electrical impulses. Finally, these electrical impulses are sent
to the electrode array located in the cochlea, where electrical fields
are created that act on the cochlear nerve. This contrasts with the
transmission of sound in a healthy ear, which involves the transmission of sound vibrations to the hair cells of the cochlea, the release
of ions and neurotransmitters in the cochlea, and the transmission
of neural impulses to the cochlear nerve and then the brain.
Surgical implantation is done under general anesthesia and
involves mastoidectomy and widening of the facial recess because

Fig. 677.4 All cochlear implants share key components, including a

microphone, speech processor, and transmitter coil, shown in a behind-­
the-­ear position in this diagram. The microphone and speech processor
pick up environmental sounds and digitize them into coded signals.
The signals are sent to the transmitter coil and relayed through the
skin to the internal device embedded in the skull. The internal device
converts the code to electronic signals, which are transmitted to the
electrode array wrapping around the cochlea. The inset shows the radiographic appearance of the stimulating electrode array. (From MED-­
EL Corporation, Innsbruck, Austria. From Smith RJH, Bale JF Jr., White
KR. Sensorineural hearing loss in children. Lancet. 2005;365:879–890.)

the approach to the cochlea is through the facial recess. After fastening the internal stimulator package in the mastoid process, the
cochlea must be opened to insert the electrode array, which is most
commonly done through an opening made in the round window.
Care is taken to avoid contamination of the cochlear fluids by bone
dust or blood. After the cochlea is closed, generally with fascia, the
wound is closed. An audiologist performs testing in the operating
room to verify the functional integrity of the implanted device.
These electrophysiologic responses from cranial nerve VIII are critical to determining a starting point for programming the external
device after the wound has healed. A plain x-­ray is often performed
in the operating room as well to document placement of the array
in the scala tympani.
The healing process after surgery is approximately 3-­4 weeks for
a child. During this time, the child cannot hear. When the child is
brought in for the first stimulation using the external equipment, programs are developed that provide the first access to sound. The methods to create the programs entail a combination of electrophysiologic
measures and behavioral testing that is like the pediatric audiologic
assessments described earlier. The initial programs are a starting point,
followed by modifications and enhancements that are based on the
parents’ and audiologist’s observations of changing auditory awareness
and vocalization.
When parents elect to pursue cochlear implantation for their child,
a long-­term commitment is necessary to ongoing engagement with
a team of rehabilitation specialists. Audiologic management entails
consistent monitoring of the child’s response to the implant and
impact on emerging language skills. Speech and language therapy is
necessary to stimulate language and to teach parents skills to support speech development. The child should be in a preschool setting
in which speech, language, social, and academic precursor skills are
fostered. For some parents, this engagement is very challenging, not
only in terms of time required but also in terms of the emotional
consequences of attempting to minimize the impact of hearing loss
on their child’s future; support for the parents is often needed in this
process from the team.

A serious possible complication of cochlear implantation is
pneumococcal meningitis. All children receiving a cochlear
implant must be vaccinated with the pneumococcal polyvalent
vaccine PCV13 (Table 677.9), and rates of pneumococcal meningitis have declined considerably since implementation of the
vaccine.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved
cochlear implantation in patients over 9 months of age with severe
to profound bilateral hearing loss not benefitting from hearing
aids; off-­label use of cochlear implants has demonstrated efficacy
in younger children and those with residual hearing. Cochlear
implantation before age 2 years improves hearing and speech,
enabling more than 90% of children to be in mainstream education. Most develop age-­appropriate auditory perception and oral
language skills. There is increasing evidence to support expansion
of the candidacy for cochlear implantation in children to be based
on outcomes of advanced testing using speech stimuli, especially in
noise. To date, implantation of children with devices that combine
acoustic input (like a hearing aid) with electric stimulation from a
cochlear implant has not been approved by the FDA. These devices,
called electroacoustic cochlear implants, or hybrids, may offer hope
for children using hearing aids but struggling with noise in the
classroom or social contexts.
Valganciclovir has been effective in treating hearing deficits in children with congenital CMV and isolated SNHL (see Chapter 302).

GENETIC COUNSELING

Families of children with the diagnosis of SNHL or a syndrome associated with SNHL and/or CHL should be referred for genetic counseling.
This will give the parents an idea of the likelihood of similar diagnoses
in future pregnancies, and the geneticist can assist in the evaluation
and testing of the patient to establish a diagnosis.

677.1 Idiopathic Sudden Sensorineural
Hearing Loss
Joseph Haddad Jr.
Sudden SNHL in a previously healthy child is uncommon but may be
from OM or other cochlear pathologies such as autoimmunity (Cogan
syndrome, others). Usually, these causes are obvious from the history
and physical examination. Sudden loss of hearing in the absence of
obvious causes may also be the result of a vascular event affecting the
cochlear apparatus or nerve, such as embolism or thrombosis (secondary to prothrombotic conditions) or hemorrhage. Additional causes
include perilymph fistula, medications, trauma, and the first episode
of Meniere syndrome. In adults, sudden SNHL is often idiopathic and
unilateral; it may be associated with a sensation of ear fullness, tinnitus, and vertigo. Identifiable causes of sudden SNHL include infections (Epstein-­Barr virus, varicella-­zoster virus, herpes simplex virus)
(see Table 677.2), vascular injury to the cochlea, enlarged vestibular
aqueduct, endolymphatic hydrops, and autoimmune inflammatory
diseases. In most (∼75%) patients with sudden SNHL, no etiology is
discovered, and it is termed idiopathic sudden SNHL. This entity is
defined by a rapid (≤72 hours) onset that may be unilateral (bilateral in
25%) and associated with a hearing loss of ≥30 dB. Patients should be
evaluated immediately to exclude other etiologies and obtain a focused
MRI of the auditory vestibular region.
Management of idiopathic sudden SNHL has included oral prednisone, intratympanic (also called transtympanic) dexamethasone perfusion, or a combination of both; the latter combination may be the most
useful. Recovery of hearing is more likely in patients with early treatment and with mild or moderate hearing loss and those with unilateral
involvement.

Chapter 678 u Congenital Malformations of the Ear

Chapter 678

Congenital Malformations
of the Ear
Joseph Haddad Jr.
The external and middle ears, derived from the first and second branchial arches and grooves, grow throughout puberty, but the inner ear,
which develops from the otocyst, reaches adult size and shape by midfetal development. The ossicles are derived from the first and second arches
(malleus and incus), and the stapes arises from the second arch and the
otic capsule. The malleus and incus achieve adult size and shape by the
15th week of gestation, and the stapes achieves adult size and shape by
the 18th week of gestation. Although the pinna, ear canal, and tympanic
membrane (TM) continue to grow after birth, congenital abnormalities
of these structures develop during the first half of gestation. Malformed
external and middle ears may be associated with serious renal anomalies, mandibulofacial dysostosis, hemifacial microsomia, and other craniofacial malformations (Table 678.1). Facial nerve abnormalities may
be associated with any of the congenital abnormalities of the ear and
temporal bone. Malformations of the external and middle ears also may
be associated with abnormalities of the inner ear and both conductive
hearing loss (CHL) and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).
Congenital ear problems may be either minor and mainly cosmetic
or major, affecting both appearance and function. Any child born with
an abnormality of the pinna, external auditory canal, or TM should
have a complete audiologic evaluation in the neonatal period. Imaging
studies are necessary for evaluation and treatment; in the patient with
other craniofacial abnormalities, a team approach with other specialists can assist in guiding therapy.

PINNA MALFORMATIONS

Severe malformations of the external ear are rare, but minor deformities
are common. Isolated abnormalities of the external ear occur in approximately 1% of children (Fig. 678.1). A pitlike depression just in front of
the helix and above the tragus may represent a cyst or an epidermis-­lined
fistulous tract (Fig. 678.2). These are common, with an incidence of
approximately 8 in 1,000 children, and may be unilateral or bilateral and
familial. The pits require surgical removal only if there is recurrent infection. Accessory skin tags, with an incidence of 1-­2/1,000 live births, can
be removed for cosmetic reasons by simple ligation if they are attached by
a narrow pedicle. If the pedicle is broad based or contains cartilage, the
defect should be corrected surgically. An unusually prominent or “lop”
ear results from lack of bending of the cartilage that creates the antihelix.
It may be improved cosmetically in the neonatal period by applying a firm
framework (sometimes soldering wire is used) attached by Steri-­Strips to
the pinna and worn continuously for weeks to months. Otoplasty for cosmetic correction can be considered in children older than 5 years of age,
when the pinna has reached approximately 80% of its adult size.
The term microtia may indicate subtle abnormalities of the size,
shape, and location of the pinna and ear canal or major abnormalities
with only small nubbins of skin and cartilage and the absence of the ear
canal opening; anotia indicates complete absence of the pinna and ear
canal (Fig. 678.3). Microtia can have a genetic or environmental predisposition. Several hereditary forms of microtia have been identified that
exhibit either autosomal dominant or recessive mendelian inheritance.
In addition, some forms due to chromosomal aberrations have been
reported. Most of the responsible genes that have been identified are
homeobox genes, which are involved in the development of pharyngeal
arches. Microtic ears often are more anterior and inferior in placement
than normal auricles, and the location and function of the facial nerve
may be abnormal. Surgery to correct microtia is considered for both
cosmetic and functional reasons; children who have some pinna can

3995

wear regular glasses, a hearing aid, and earrings and feel more normal
in appearance. If the microtia is severe, some patients may opt for creation and attachment of a prosthetic ear, which cosmetically closely

resembles a real ear. Surgery to correct severe microtia may involve a
multistage procedure, including carving and transplantation of autogenous cartilage rib grafts and local soft tissue flaps. Cosmetic reconstruction of the auricle usually is performed between 5 and 7 years of
age and is performed before canal atresia repair in children deemed
appropriate for this surgery.

CONGENITAL STENOSIS OR ATRESIA OF THE
EXTERNAL AUDITORY CANAL

Stenosis or atresia of the ear canal often occurs in association with
malformation of the auricle and middle ear. Malformations can occur

in isolation or as part of a genetic syndrome. For example, the ear
canal is narrow in trisomy 21, and external canal stenosis or atresia is
common in branchiooculofacial syndrome, leading to CHL. Audiometric evaluation of these children should be undertaken as early
in life as possible. Most children with significant CHL secondary to
bilateral atresia wear bone conduction hearing aids for the first several years of life. Diagnosis, evaluation, and surgical planning often
are aided by CT, and sometimes MRI, of the temporal bone. Mild
cases of ear canal stenosis do not require surgical enlargement unless
the patient develops chronic external otitis or severe cerumen impaction that affects hearing.

Chapter 678 u Congenital Malformations of the Ear
Reconstructive ear canal and middle-­ear surgery for atresia usually
is considered for children older than 5 years of age who have bilateral
deformities resulting in significant CHL. The aim of reconstructive surgery is to improve hearing to a point where the child may not need a
hearing aid or to provide an ear canal and pinna so that the child can
derive improved benefit from an air-­conduction hearing aid. Hearing
results for atresiaplasty range from fair to excellent. CT evidence of an
adequate middle-­ear cleft, ossicles, and mastoid is required to perform
the surgery; the position of the facial nerve, which often is in an abnormal location in these children, also must be considered (Fig. 678.4).
The use of bone-­anchored hearing aids is a safe, reliable, and low-­risk
alternative to atresiaplasty, and hearing results are generally excellent.
Bone-­anchored hearing aids may also be useful for rehabilitation of
nonoptimal atresiaplasty hearing results. These devices are approved
by the US Food and Drug Administration for surgical placement in
children age 5 years and older; before age 5 years, they can be worn
with a soft band around the head. Disadvantages include the fact that
cosmesis is not very good (a bone-­anchored hearing aid has a visible
titanium abutment and snap-­on hearing aid) and frequent wound care
is required. Middle ear implants are effective alternatives for those who
cannot tolerate foreign bodies in the ear for medical reasons or rely on
good perception of high-­frequency sounds.

CONGENITAL MIDDLE-­EAR MALFORMATIONS

Children may have congenital abnormalities of the middle ear as an
isolated defect or in association with other abnormalities of the temporal bone, especially the ear canal and pinna, or as part of a syndrome.

A

3997

Affected children usually have CHL but may have mixed CHL and
SNHL. Most malformations involve the ossicles, with the incus most
commonly affected. Other less common abnormalities of the middle
ear include persistent stapedial artery, high-­riding jugular bulb, and
abnormalities of the shape and volume of the aerated portion of the
middle ear and mastoid; all present problems for a surgeon. Depending on the type of abnormality and the presence of other anomalies,
surgery may be considered to improve hearing.

CONGENITAL INNER EAR MALFORMATIONS

Congenital inner ear malformations are classified as a result of
improvements in imaging modalities (Table 678.2). As many as 20%
of children with SNHL may have anatomic abnormalities identified
on CT or MRI. Congenital malformations of the inner ear usually
are associated with SNHL of various degrees, from mild to profound.
These malformations are most commonly found in infants and may
occur as isolated anomalies or in association with other syndromes,
genetic abnormalities, or structural abnormalities of the head and neck
(Table 678.3). High-­resolution temporal bone CT can identify enlarged
vestibular aqueducts and cochlear nerve canal stenosis in association
with SNHL. Although no therapy exists for this condition, it may be
associated with progressive SNHL in some children; therefore diagnosis may have some prognostic value.
Congenital perilymphatic fistula of the oval or round window membrane may present as a rapid-­onset, fluctuating, or progressive SNHL
with or without vertigo and often is associated with congenital inner ear
abnormalities. Middle-­ear exploration may be required to confirm this

CONGENITAL CHOLESTEATOMA

A congenital cholesteatoma (approximately 2–5% of all cholesteatomas) is a nonneoplastic, destructive, cystic lesion that usually appears
as a white, round, cystlike structure medial to an intact TM. Cysts
are seen most commonly in boys and in the anterior-­superior portion of the middle ear, although they can present in other locations
and within the TM or in the skin of the ear canal. They can be classified as “open,” meaning in direct continuity with mucosa of the middle
ear, or “closed.” Affected children often have no prior history of otitis
media. One theory for the pathogenesis is that the cyst derives from
a congenital rest of epithelial tissue that persists beyond 33 weeks of
gestation, when it ordinarily would disappear. Other theories include
squamous metaplasia of the middle ear, entrance of squamous epithelium through a nonintact eardrum into the middle ear, ectodermal implants between the first and second branchial arch remnants,
and residual amniotic fluid squamous debris. Congenital or acquired
cholesteatoma should be suspected when deep retraction pockets,
keratin debris, chronic drainage, aural granulation tissue, or a mass
behind or involving the TM is present. Congenital cholesteatoma is
often asymptomatic, whereas acquired cholesteatoma commonly
presents with otorrhea. Besides acting as a benign tumor causing
local bone destruction, the keratinaceous debris of a cholesteatoma
serves as a culture medium, leading to chronic otitis media. Complications include ossicular erosion with hearing loss, bone erosion
into the inner ear with dizziness, or exposure of the dura, with consequent meningitis or a brain abscess. Evaluation includes a CT scan
(Fig. 678.5) to detect bone erosion and audiometry to assess air and
bone conduction and speech reception and discrimination. Treatment includes cholesteatoma removal, repair of damaged small middle ear bones, and mastoidectomy in 50% of congenital and >90% of
acquired cholesteatoma cases. A second-­look procedure 6-­9 months
after primary surgery is usually recommended to detect and remove
small amounts of residual disease before more extensive recurrence or
development of complications. Higher initial stage of disease, erosion
of ossicles, cholesteatoma abutting or enveloping the incus or stapes,

Chapter 679 u External Otitis (Otitis Externa)

3999

The normal flora of the external canal consists mainly of aerobic
bacteria and includes coagulase-­negative staphylococci (see Chapter
227.3), Corynebacterium (diphtheroids; see Chapter 233), Micrococcus, and occasionally Staphylococcus aureus (see Chapter 227.1), viridans streptococci (see Chapter 231), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (see
Chapter 251.1). Excessive wetness (swimming, bathing, increased
environmental humidity), dryness (dry canal skin and lack of cerumen), the presence of other skin pathologic conditions (previous infection, eczema, or other forms of dermatitis), and trauma (due to digital
or foreign body, use of cotton-­tipped swabs) make the skin of the canal
vulnerable to infection by the normal flora or exogenous bacteria and
predispose to colonization with gram-­negative bacteria.

ETIOLOGY

Fig. 678.5 Congenital cholesteatoma. Axial CT of left ear shows soft
tissue mass (arrow) in the middle ear. This mass was noted otoscopically
behind an intact membrane. (From Faerber EN, Booth TN, Swartz JD.
Temporal bone and ear. In Slovis TL, ed. Caffey’s Pediatric Diagnostic
Imaging, 11th ed. Philadelphia: Mosby; 2008: Fig. 44.31, p. 598.)

External otitis (swimmer’s ear, although it can occur without swimming) is caused most by P. aeruginosa (up to 60%), but S. aureus,
Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococci, coagulase-­negative staphylococci and diphtheroids, and fungi
such as Candida and Aspergillus also may rarely be isolated. External
otitis results from chronic irritation and maceration from excessive
moisture in the canal. The loss of protective cerumen may play a role,
as may trauma, but cerumen impaction with trapping of water also
can cause infection. Inflammation of the ear canal due to herpesvirus,
varicella-­zoster virus, other skin exanthems, and eczema also may predispose to external otitis.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
and need for removal of the ossicles are associated with increased likelihood of residual cholesteatoma, which occurs in ∼10% of congenital
and ∼25% of acquired cases. More extensive disease at initial surgery
is associated with poorer hearing outcomes. Children with significant
inflammation or extensive scarring may require a 2-­stage procedure
with initial removal of the cholesteatoma and subsequent repair of
damaged middle ear structures.

Chapter 679

External Otitis (Otitis
Externa)
Joseph Haddad Jr.
In an infant, the outer two thirds of the ear canal is cartilaginous and
the inner one third is bony. In an older child and adult, the outer one
third is cartilaginous and the inner two thirds is bony. The epithelium
is thinner in the bony portion than in the cartilaginous portion, there
is no subcutaneous tissue, and epithelium is tightly applied to the
underlying periosteum; hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and apocrine
glands are scarce or absent. The skin in the cartilaginous area has well-­
developed dermis and subcutaneous tissue and contains hair follicles,
sebaceous glands, and apocrine glands. The highly viscid secretions of
the sebaceous glands and the watery, pigmented secretions of the apocrine glands in the outer portion of the canal combine with exfoliated
surface cells of the skin to form cerumen, a protective, waxy, water-­
repellent coating.

The predominant symptom is acute rapid onset (typically within 48
hours) of ear pain (otalgia), often severe, accentuated by manipulation of the pinna or by pressure on the tragus and by jaw motion. The
severity of the pain and tenderness (tragus or pinna, or both) may be
disproportionate to the degree of inflammation, because the skin of the
external ear canal is tightly adhered to the underlying perichondrium
and periosteum. Itching often is a precursor of pain and usually is characteristic of chronic inflammation of the canal or resolving acute otitis
externa. Conductive hearing loss (CHL) may result from edema of the
skin and tympanic membrane (TM), serous or purulent secretions, or
the canal skin thickening associated with chronic external otitis.
Edema of the ear canal, erythema, and thick, clumpy otorrhea are
prominent signs of acute disease. The cerumen usually is white and
soft in consistency, as opposed to its usual yellow color and firmer consistency (Fig. 679.1). The canal often is so tender and swollen that the
entire ear canal and TM cannot be adequately visualized, and complete otoscopic examination may be delayed until the acute swelling
subsides. If the TM can be visualized, it may appear either normal or
opaque. TM mobility may be normal, or, if the TM is thickened, mobility may be reduced in response to positive and negative pressure.
Other physical findings may include palpable and tender lymph
nodes in the periauricular region and erythema and swelling of the
pinna and periauricular skin. Rarely, facial paralysis, other cranial
nerve abnormalities, vertigo, and/or sensorineural hearing loss are
present. If these occur, necrotizing (malignant) otitis externa, an
invasive infection of the temporal bone and skull base, is probable. Fortunately, this disease is rare in children and is seen only in association
with immunocompromise or severe malnourishment. In adults, it is
associated with diabetes mellitus.

DIAGNOSIS

Diffuse external otitis may be confused with furunculosis, otitis
media (OM), and mastoiditis (Table 679.1). Furuncles occur in the
lateral hair-­bearing part of the ear canal; furunculosis usually causes a
localized swelling of the canal limited to one quadrant, whereas external otitis is associated with concentric swelling and involves the entire
ear canal. In OM, the TM may be perforated, severely retracted, or
bulging and immobile; hearing usually is impaired. If the middle ear is
draining through a perforated TM or tympanostomy tube, secondary
external otitis may occur; if the TM is not visible owing to drainage
or ear canal swelling, it may be difficult to distinguish acute OM with
drainage from an acute external otitis. Pain on manipulation of the

auricle and significant lymphadenitis are not common features of OM,
and these findings assist in the differential diagnosis. In some patients
with external otitis, the periauricular edema is so extensive that the
auricle is pushed forward, creating a condition that may be confused
with acute mastoiditis and a subperiosteal abscess. In mastoiditis, the
postauricular fold is obliterated, whereas in external otitis, the fold is

usually better preserved. In acute mastoiditis, a history of OM and
hearing loss is usual; tenderness is noted over the mastoid and not on
movement of the auricle; and otoscopic examination may show sagging
of the posterior canal wall.

Chapter 679 u External Otitis (Otitis Externa)
(trigeminal neuralgia; herpes simplex virus, varicella-­zoster virus; see
Table 676.1).

TREATMENT

Topical otic preparations containing acetic acid, with or without
hydrocortisone, or neomycin (active against gram-­positive organisms and some gram-­negative organisms, notably Proteus spp.),
polymyxin (active against gram-­negative bacilli, notably Pseudomonas spp.), or a quinolone (ciprofloxacin), with or without hydrocortisone, are all highly effective in treating most forms of acute
external otitis. A nonototoxic (quinolone) antibiotic should be
chosen in the setting of known TM perforation or tympanostomy
tube. If canal edema is marked, the patient may need referral to a
specialist for cleaning and possible wick placement. An otic antibiotic and corticosteroid eardrop is often recommended. A wick can
be inserted into the ear canal and topical antibiotics applied to the
wick 3 times a day for 24-­48 hours. The wick can be removed after
2-­3 days, at which time the edema of the ear canal usually is markedly improved and the ear canal and TM are better seen. Topical
antibiotics are then continued by direct instillation. When the pain
is severe, oral analgesics (e.g., ibuprofen, acetaminophen) may be
necessary for a few days.
Someone other than the patient should place the drops in the ear
canal while the patient is recumbent with the affected ear facing
up. The drops should fill the canal, and the patient should remain

4001

in place for 3-­5 minutes. Gently moving the ear to and fro may
enhance the drops to fill the ear canal. Patients should respond to
initial therapeutics in 48-­72 hours. Failure to improve in this time
frame should prompt assessment of drug delivery and adherence
to therapy, consideration for change in therapy, and consideration
of alternative diagnoses. Careful evaluation for underlying conditions should also be undertaken in patients with severe or recurrent
otitis externa. Figure 679.2 outlines an approach to managing acute
external otitis.
As the inflammatory process subsides, cleaning the canal with a
suction or cotton-­tipped applicator to remove the debris enhances
the effectiveness of the topical medications. In subacute and
chronic infections, periodic cleansing of the canal is essential. In
severe acute external otitis associated with fever and lymphadenitis,
oral or parenteral antibiotics may be indicated; an ear canal culture should be done, and empirical antibiotic treatment can then
be modified if necessary, based on susceptibility of the organism
cultured. A fungal infection of the external auditory canal, or otomycosis, is characterized by fluffy white debris, sometimes with
black spores seen; treatment includes cleaning and application of
antifungal solutions such as clotrimazole or nystatin; other antifungal agents include boric acid powder, m-­cresyl acetate 25%, gentian
violet 2%, and thimerosal 1:1,000.

and imaging studies to evaluate the extent of the disease. Surgical
intervention to obtain cultures or debride devitalized tissue may be
necessary.

PREVENTION

Preventing external otitis may be necessary for individuals susceptible to recurrences, especially children who swim. The most effective prophylaxis is instillation of dilute alcohol or acetic acid (2%)
immediately after swimming or bathing. During an acute episode
of otitis externa, patients should not swim, and the ears should be
protected from excessive water during bathing. A hair dryer may be
used to clear moisture from the ear after swimming as a method of
prevention. Cotton-­tipped swabs (or another material) may cause
trauma to the ear canal, including tympanic membrane perforation, cerumen impaction, or retained foreign body and should be
avoided.

OTHER DISEASES OF THE EXTERNAL EAR
Furunculosis

Furunculosis, caused by S. aureus, affects only the hair-­containing
outer third of the ear canal and typically occurs at the inferior
entrance to the meatus. Mild forms are treated with oral antibiotics
active against S. aureus. If an abscess develops, incision and drainage may be necessary.

Acute Cellulitis

Acute cellulitis of the auricle and external auditory canal usually is
caused by group A streptococcus and occasionally by S. aureus. The
skin is red, hot, and indurated, without a sharply defined border. Fever
may be present with little or no exudate in the canal. Parenteral administration of penicillin G or a penicillinase-­resistant penicillin is the
therapy of choice.

Perichondritis and Chondritis

sumac also may produce contact dermatitis. Hair care products have
been implicated in sensitive individuals.
Infectious eczematoid dermatitis is caused by a purulent infection
of the external canal, middle ear, or mastoid; the purulent drainage
infects the skin of the canal or auricle, or both. The lesion is weeping,
erythematous, or crusted.
Atopic dermatitis occurs in children with a familial or personal history of allergy; the auricle, particularly the postauricular fold, becomes
thickened, scaly, and excoriated.
Neurodermatitis is recognized by intense itching and erythematous,
thickened epidermis localized to the concha and orifice of the meatus.
Treatment of these dermatoses depends on the type but should
include application of an appropriate topical medication, elimination
of the source of infection or contact when identified, and management
of any underlying dermatologic problem. In addition to topical antibiotics (or antifungals), topical steroids are helpful if contact dermatitis
(see Chapter 696.1), atopic dermatitis (see Chapter 696), or eczematoid
dermatitis is suspected.

Herpes Simplex Virus

See Chapter 299.
Herpes simplex virus may appear as vesicles on the auricle and lips.
The lesions eventually become encrusted and dry and may be confused
with impetigo. Topical application of a 10% solution of carbamide peroxide in anhydrous glycerol is symptomatically helpful. Ramsay Hunt
syndrome (herpes zoster oticus with facial paralysis) may present initially with otalgia, with subsequent appearance of vesicles in the ear
canal and on the pinna and with facial paralysis and pain. Other cranial
nerves may be affected as well, especially the eighth nerve. Treatment
of herpes zoster oticus includes systemic antiviral agents, such as acyclovir, and systemic corticosteroids. As many as 50% of patients with
Ramsay Hunt syndrome do not completely recover their facial nerve
function.

Perichondritis is an infection involving the skin and perichondrium
of the auricular cartilage; extension of infection to the cartilage is
termed chondritis. The ear canal, especially the lateral aspect, also
may be involved. Early perichondritis may be difficult to differentiate from cellulitis because both are characterized by skin that is red,
edematous, and tender. The main cause of perichondritis/chondritis
and cellulitis is trauma (accidental or iatrogenic, laceration or contusion), including ear piercing, especially when done through the
cartilage. The most commonly isolated organism in perichondritis
and chondritis is P. aeruginosa, although other gram-­negative and,
occasionally, gram-­positive organisms may be found. Treatment
involves systemic, often parenteral, antibiotics; surgery to drain an
abscess or remove nonviable skin or cartilage may also be needed.
Removal of all ear jewelry is mandatory in the presence of infection.

Bullous Myringitis

Dermatoses

Exostoses represent benign hyperplasia of the perichondrium and
underlying bone. Those involving the auditory canal tend to be
found in people who swim often in cold water. Exostoses are broad
based, often multiple, and bilateral. Osteomas are benign bony
growths in the ear canal of uncertain cause (see Chapter 550.2).
They usually are solitary and attached by a narrow pedicle to the
tympanosquamous or tympanomastoid suture line. Both are more
common in males; exostoses are more common than osteomas. Surgical treatment is recommended when large masses cause cerumen
impaction, ear canal obstruction, or hearing loss.

Various dermatoses (seborrheic, contact, infectious eczematoid, or
neurodermatoid) are common causes of inflammation of the external
canal; scratching and the introduction of infecting organisms cause
acute external otitis in these conditions.
Seborrheic dermatitis is characterized by greasy scales that flake
and crumble as they are detached from the epidermis; associated
changes in the scalp, forehead, cheeks, brow, postauricular areas, and
concha are usual.
Contact dermatitis of the auricle or canal may be caused by earrings or by topical otic medications such as neomycin, which may produce erythema, vesiculation, edema, and weeping. Poison ivy, oak, and

Commonly associated with an acute upper respiratory tract infection,
bullous myringitis presents as an ear infection with more severe pain
than usual. On examination, hemorrhagic or serous blisters (bullae)
may be seen on the TM. The disease sometimes is difficult to differentiate from acute OM because a large bulla may be confused with a bulging TM. The organisms involved are the same as those that cause acute
OM, including both bacteria and viruses. Treatment consists of empiric
antibiotic therapy and pain medications. In addition to ibuprofen or
codeine for severe pain, a topical anesthetic eardrop may also provide
some relief. Incision of the bullae, although not necessary, promptly
relieves the pain.

Chapter 680 u Otitis Media

4003

EPIDEMIOLOGY

Chapter 680

Several factors affect the occurrence of OM, including age, gender,
genetic background, socioeconomic status, breast milk feeding, degree
of exposure to tobacco smoke, degree of exposure to other children,
presence or absence of respiratory allergy, season of the year, and pneumococcal vaccination status. Children with certain types of immune
deficiencies and congenital craniofacial anomalies (i.e., cleft palate,
Down syndrome) are particularly prone to OM.

Otitis Media
Brittany Player
The term otitis media (OM) has two main categories: acute infection, which is termed suppurative or acute otitis media (AOM), and
inflammation accompanied by middle-­ear effusion (MEE), termed
nonsuppurative or secretory OM, or otitis media with effusion
(OME). These two main types are interrelated: acute infection usually is succeeded by residual inflammation and effusion that, in turn,
predispose children to recurrent infection. MEE is a feature of both
AOM and OME and is an expression of the underlying middle-­ear
mucosal inflammation. MEE results in the conductive hearing loss
associated with OM, ranging from none to as much as 50 dB of hearing loss (moderate hearing loss).
The peak incidence and prevalence of OM are during the first 2 years
of life. More than 80% of children experience at least one episode of
OM by the age of 3 years. Conservative estimates for OM-­related costs
place the annual burden at $3-­5 billion per year. Accounting for >10%
of pediatric primary care encounters, OM is a leading reason for pediatric visits and use of antibiotics and figures importantly in the differential diagnosis of fever. Recurrent OM is defined as a minimum
of three episodes of AOM in 6 months or four episodes of AOM in 12
months with at least one of those episodes occurring in the preceding 6 months. It often serves as the main justification for myringotomy
with insertion of tympanostomy tubes and adenoidectomy, the most
frequently performed operations in infants and young children. OM is
also the most common cause of acquired hearing loss in children. OM
has a propensity to become chronic and recur. The earlier in life a child
experiences the first episode, the greater the frequency of recurrence,
severity, and persistence of MEE.
Accurate diagnosis of AOM in infants and young children may be
difficult (Figs. 680.1-­680.3). Symptoms may not be apparent, especially in early infancy and in chronic stages of the disease. Accurate
visualization of the tympanic membrane (TM) and middle-­ear space
may be difficult because of anatomy, patient cooperation, or blockage
by cerumen, removal of which may be arduous and time consuming. Abnormalities of the eardrum may also be subtle or difficult to
appreciate. In the face of these difficulties, both underdiagnosis and
overdiagnosis occur.

1. Abnormal TM color:

The age of onset of OM is an important predictor of the development
of recurrent and chronic OM, with earlier age of onset having an
increased risk for exhibiting these difficulties later in life. The development of at least one episode of OM is reported as 63–85% by 12 months
and 66–99% by 24 months of age. The percentage of days with MEE is
5–27% during the first year of life and 6–18% during the second year
of life. Across groups, rates are highest at 6-­20 months of age. After
the age of 2, the incidence and prevalence of OM decline progressively,
although the disease remains relatively common into the early school-­
age years. The most likely reasons for the higher rates in infants and
younger children include less well-­developed immunologic defenses
and less favorable eustachian tubal structure and function.

Gender

Epidemiologic data suggest an incidence of OM greater in males than
in females, although some studies have found no gender-­related differences in the occurrence of OM.

Genetic Background

That middle-­ear disease tends to run in families is a commonplace
observation, suggesting that OM may have a heritable component.
The degree of concordance for the occurrence of OM is much greater
among monozygotic than among dizygotic twins. OM is especially
prevalent and severe among Native American, Inuit, and Indigenous
Australian children.

Socioeconomic Status

Elements contributing to the association of poverty with OM include
crowding, limited hygienic facilities, suboptimal nutritional status,
limited access to medical care, and limited resources for complying
with prescribed medical regimens.

Breast Milk Compared with Formula Feeding

Most studies have found a protective effect of breast milk feeding
against OM. This protective effect may be greater in socioeconomically

4004 Part XXVIII u The Ear
Season

In keeping with the pattern of occurrence of upper respiratory tract
infections in general, the highest rates of occurrence of OM are observed
during cold weather months and the lowest rates during warm weather
months. In OM, it is likely that these findings strongly depend on the
significant association of OM with viral respiratory illnesses.

Congenital Anomalies
A

B

OM is universal among infants with unrepaired palatal clefts and is
also highly prevalent among children with submucous cleft palate,
other craniofacial anomalies, and Down syndrome (see Chapter 57).
The common feature in these congenital anomalies is a deficiency in
eustachian tube function, which predisposes these children to middle-­
ear disease.

disadvantaged children than in more advantaged children. The protective effect is attributable to the milk itself rather than to the mechanics
of breastfeeding.

Exposure to Tobacco Smoke

Tobacco smoke exposure is an important preventable risk factor in
the development of OM. Studies that have used objective measures to
determine infant exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke, such as cotinine levels, have consistently identified a significant linkage between
tobacco smoke and OM.

Exposure to Other Children

OM is more common with repeated exposure to other children,
whether at home or in out-­of-­home group daycare. Together, but independently, family socioeconomic status and the extent of exposure to
other children appear to constitute two of the most important identifiable risk factors for developing OM.

Pacifier use is linked with an increased incidence of OM and recurrence of OM, although the effect is small. Neither maternal age nor
birthweight nor season of birth appears to influence the occurrence
of OM once other demographic factors are accounted for. Some suggest an association of OM with bottle feeding in the recumbent position (propped bottle). Children with HIV infection have a high risk for
recurrent OM.

ETIOLOGY
Acute Otitis Media

Pathogenic bacteria can be isolated by standard culture techniques from
middle-­ear fluid in most documented AOM cases. Three pathogens
predominate in AOM: Streptococcus pneumoniae (see Chapter 228),
nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (see Chapter 240), and Moraxella
catarrhalis (see Chapter 242). The overall incidence of these organisms
has changed with the use of the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine. Widespread use of the expanded serotype coverage 13-­valent as compared
with the 7-­valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has further reduced
the prevalence of S. pneumoniae as a cause of AOM, particularly the
virulent 19A serotype. Less common pathogens include group A streptococcus (see Chapter 229), Staphylococcus aureus (see Chapter 227.1),
and gram-­negative organisms. Gram-­negative organisms and S. aureus
are found most commonly in neonates and very young infants who are
hospitalized; in outpatient settings, the distribution of pathogens in
these young infants is similar to that in older infants. Molecular techniques to identify nonculturable bacterial pathogens have suggested the
importance of other bacterial species such as Alloiococcus otitidis.
Respiratory viruses may also be identified in MEEs of children with
AOM, either alone or, more commonly, in association with pathogenic
bacteria. Of these viruses, rhinovirus (see Chapter 310) and respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV; see Chapter 307) are found most often. AOM is a
known complication of bronchiolitis; middle-­ear aspirates in children
with bronchiolitis regularly contain bacterial pathogens, suggesting
that RSV is rarely, if ever, the sole cause of their AOM. Viral pathogens
have a negative impact on eustachian tube function, can impair local
immune function and increase bacterial adherence, and can change
the pharmacokinetic dynamics, reducing the efficacy of antimicrobial
medications. However, it remains uncertain whether viruses alone can
cause AOM or whether their role is limited to setting the stage for bacterial invasion, and perhaps also to amplify the inflammatory process,
thereby interfering with resolution of the bacterial infection.

Otitis Media with Effusion

Using standard culture techniques, the pathogens typically found in
AOM are recoverable in only 30% of children with OME. However,
using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), MEEs contain evidence of
bacterial DNA and viral RNA in much larger proportions of these
children. Biofilms of pathogenic bacteria are present on the middle-­
ear mucosa and adenoid pad in most children with chronic OM. Biofilms consist of aggregated and adherent bacteria, embedded in an
extracellular matrix and in neutrophil extracellular traps, allowing for

Chapter 680 u Otitis Media
protection against antimicrobials; their presence may contribute to the
persistence of pathogens and the recalcitrance of chronic OM to antibiotic treatment.

PATHOGENESIS

A multifactorial disease process, risk profile, and host-­pathogen interactions play important roles in the pathogenesis of OM. Such events as
alterations in mucociliary clearance through repeated viral exposure
experienced in daycare settings or through exposure to tobacco smoke
may tip the balance of pathogenesis in less virulent OM pathogens in
their favor, especially in children with a unique host predisposition.

Anatomic Factors

Patients with significant craniofacial abnormalities affecting eustachian
tube function have an increased incidence of OM. During the pathogenesis of OM, the eustachian tube demonstrates decreased effectiveness in ventilating the middle-­ear space.
Under usual circumstances the eustachian tube is passively closed
and is opened by contraction of the tensor veli palatini muscle. In
relation to the middle ear, the tube has three main functions: ventilation, protection, and clearance. The middle-­ear mucosa depends on
a continuing supply of air from the nasopharynx delivered by way of
the eustachian tube. Interruption of this ventilatory process by tubal
obstruction initiates an inflammatory response that includes secretory
metaplasia, compromise of the mucociliary transport system, and effusion of liquid into the tympanic cavity. Measurements of eustachian
tube function have demonstrated that the tubal function is suboptimal
during the events of OM with increased opening pressures.
Eustachian tube obstruction may result from extraluminal blockage via hypertrophied nasopharyngeal adenoid tissue or tumor or may
result from intraluminal obstruction via inflammatory edema of the
tubal mucosa, most commonly as a consequence of a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Progressive reduction in tubal wall compliance
with increasing age may explain the progressive decline in the occurrence of OM as children grow older. The protection and clearance functions of the eustachian tube may also be involved in the pathogenesis of
OM. Thus, if the eustachian tube is patulous or excessively compliant,
it may fail to protect the middle ear from reflux of infective nasopharyngeal secretions, whereas impairment of the mucociliary clearance
function of the tube might contribute to both the establishment and
persistence of infection. The shorter and more horizontal orientation of
the tube in infants and young children may increase the likelihood of
reflux from the nasopharynx and impair passive gravitational drainage
through the eustachian tube.
Children with craniofacial abnormalities experience an increased
incidence of OM associated with the abnormal eustachian tube function. In children with cleft palate, where OM is a universal finding, a
main factor underlying the chronic middle-­ear inflammation appears
to be impairment of the opening mechanism of the eustachian tube.
Possible factors include muscular changes, tubal compliance factors,
and defective velopharyngeal valving, which may result in disturbed
aerodynamic and hydrodynamic relationships in the nasopharynx and
proximal portions of the eustachian tubes. In children with other craniofacial anomalies and with Down syndrome, the high prevalence of
OM has also been attributed to structural and/or functional eustachian
tubal abnormalities.

Host Factors

The effectiveness of a child’s immune system in response to the bacterial and viral infections of the upper airway and middle ear during
early childhood probably is the most important factor in determining
which children are otitis prone. The maturation of this immune system
during early childhood is most likely the primary event leading to the
decrease in incidence of OM with increased age. Immunoglobulin A
(IgA) deficiency is found in some children with recurrent AOM, but
the significance is questionable; many children with IgA deficiency do
not experience recurrent episodes of AOM. Selective immunoglobulin

4005

G (IgG) subclass deficiencies (despite normal total serum IgG) may be
found in children with recurrent AOM in association with recurrent
sinopulmonary infection, and these deficiencies probably underlie the
susceptibility to infection. Children with HIV infection have recurrent
and difficult-­to-­treat episodes of AOM in the first and second year of
life. Children with recurrent OM that is not associated with recurrent
infection at other anatomic sites rarely have a readily identifiable immunologic deficiency. Evidence that subtle immune deficits play a role in
the pathogenesis of recurrent AOM is provided by studies involving
antibody responses to various types of infection and immunization; by
the observation that breast milk feeding, as opposed to formula feeding, confers some protection against the occurrence of OM in infants
with cleft palate; and by studies in which young children with recurrent
AOM achieved a measure of protection from intramuscularly administered bacterial polysaccharide immunoglobulin or intravenously
administered polyclonal immunoglobulin. This evidence, along with
the documented decrease in incidence of upper respiratory tract infections and OM as children’s immune systems develop and mature, is
indicative of the importance of a child’s innate immune system in the
pathogenesis of OM (see Chapter 164).

Viral Pathogens

Although OM may develop and persist in the absence of apparent
respiratory tract infection, many, if not most, episodes are initiated by
viral or bacterial upper respiratory tract infection. Among children in
group daycare, AOM was observed in approximately 30–40% of children with respiratory illness caused by RSV (see Chapter 307), influenza viruses (see Chapter 305), or adenoviruses (see Chapter 309) and
in approximately 10–15% of children with respiratory illness caused
by parainfluenza viruses (see Chapter 306), rhinoviruses (see Chapter
310), or enteroviruses (see Chapter 297). Viral infection of the upper
respiratory tract results in release of cytokines and inflammatory mediators, some of which may cause eustachian tube dysfunction.
Respiratory viruses also may enhance nasopharyngeal bacterial
colonization and adherence and impair host immune defenses against
bacterial infection.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Symptoms of AOM are variable, especially in infants and young children. In young children, evidence of ear pain may be manifested by
irritability or a change in sleeping or eating habits and, occasionally,
holding or tugging at the ear. Pulling at the ear alone has a low sensitivity and specificity. Fever may also be present and may occasionally be
the only sign. Rupture of the TM with purulent otorrhea is uncommon.
Systemic symptoms and symptoms associated with upper respiratory
tract infections also occur; occasionally there may be no symptoms,
with the disease having been discovered at a routine health examination. The Acute Otitis Media Severity of Symptom (AOM-­SOS) scale
is a five-­item validated symptom score that has proven beneficial as
a tool to monitor AOM symptoms in patients and studies of antimicrobial effectiveness in OM. OME often is not accompanied by overt
complaints of the child but can be accompanied by hearing loss. This
hearing loss may manifest as changes in speech patterns but often goes
undetected if unilateral or mild in nature, especially in younger children. Balance difficulties or disequilibrium can rarely be associated
with OME, and older children may complain of mild discomfort or a
sense of fullness in the ear.

EXAMINATION OF THE TYMPANIC MEMBRANE
Otoscopy

Two types of otoscope heads are available: surgical or operating and
diagnostic or pneumatic. The surgical head embodies a lens that can
swivel over a wide arc and an unenclosed light source, thus providing ready access of the examiner’s instruments to the external auditory
canal and TM. Use of the surgical head is optimal for removing cerumen or debris from the canal under direct observation and is necessary
for satisfactorily performing tympanocentesis or myringotomy. The

4006 Part XXVIII u The Ear
diagnostic head incorporates a larger lens, an enclosed light source,
and a nipple for the attachment of a rubber bulb and tubing. When an
attached speculum is fitted snugly into the external auditory canal, an
airtight chamber is created comprising the vault of the otoscope head,
the bulb and tubing, the speculum, and the proximal portion of the
external canal. Although examination of the ear in young children is a
relatively invasive procedure that is often met with lack of cooperation
by the patient, this task can be enhanced if done with as little pain as
possible. The outer portion of the ear canal contains hair-­bearing skin
and subcutaneous fat and cartilage that allow a speculum to be placed
with relatively little discomfort. Closer to the TM the ear canal is made
of bone and is lined only with skin and no adnexal structures or subcutaneous fat; a speculum pushed too far forward and placed in this
area often causes skin abrasion and pain. Using a rubber-­tipped speculum or adding a small sleeve of rubber tubing to the tip of the plastic
speculum may serve to minimize patient discomfort and enhance the
ability to achieve a proper fit and an airtight seal, facilitating pneumatic
otoscopy.
Learning to perform pneumatic otoscopy is a critical skill in being
able to assess a child’s ear and in making an accurate diagnosis of AOM.
The degree of TM mobility in response to both positive and negative pressure can be estimated by observing as the bulb is alternately
squeezed gently and released, thus providing a critical assessment of
middle-­ear fluid, which is a hallmark sign of both AOM and OME (see
Fig. 680.1). With both types of otoscope heads, bright illumination is
also critical for adequate visualization of the TM.

Clearing the External Auditory Canal

Children’s ears are “self-­cleaning” because of squamous migration of
ear canal skin. Cleaning of cerumen with cotton-­tipped swabs should
be avoided, as it often worsens impaction by pushing cerumen deeper
into the canal, compacting it. If the TM is obscured by cerumen, the
cerumen should be removed. This can be accomplished through direct
visualization using a headlight or through the surgical head of the
otoscope by using an ear curette or gentle suction with a No. 5 or 7
French ear suction tube. During this procedure, it may be most advantageous to restrain the infant or young child in the prone position,
turning the child’s head to the left or right as each ear is cleared. In
children old enough to cooperate, clearing of the external canal may be
achieved more easily and less traumatically by lavage than by mechanical removal, provided one can be certain that a TM perforation is not
present.

Tympanic Membrane Findings

Important characteristics of the TM consist of contour, color, translucence, structural changes, if any, and mobility. The TM is anatomically
divided into the pars tensa and pars flaccida. The pars tensa comprises
the lower two thirds of the drum inferior to the lateral process of the
malleus. Its contour is normally slightly concave; abnormalities consist of fullness or bulging or, conversely, extreme retraction. The normal color of the pars tensa is pearly gray, with the pars flaccida being
slightly more vascular in nature. Erythema may be a sign of inflammation or infection, but unless intense, erythema alone may result from
crying or vascular flushing. Abnormal whiteness of the membrane may
result from either scarring or the presence of effusion in the middle-­ear
cavity; this effusion also may impart an amber, pale yellow, or, rarely,
bluish color. Rarely a persistent focal white area may be indicative of a
congenital cholesteatoma in the middle-­ear space. Normally, the membrane is translucent, although some degree of opacity may be normal in
the first few months of life; later, opacification denotes either scarring
or, more commonly, underlying effusion. Structural changes include
scars, perforations, and retraction pockets. Retractions or perforations, especially in the posterior-­superior quadrant, or pars flaccida,
of the TM may be a sign of cholesteatoma formation. Of all the visible
characteristics of the TM, mobility is the most sensitive and specific
in determining the presence or absence of MEE. Mobility is generally
not an all-­or-­none phenomenon. A total absence of mobility does exist
with a TM perforation that can develop after a substantial increase in
middle-­ear pressure associated with effusion. When a perforation is

not present, substantial impairment of mobility is the more common
finding with MEE. Bulging of the TM is the most specific finding of
AOM (97%) but has lower sensitivity (51%) (see Figs. 680.2 and 680.3).

Diagnosis

A diagnosis of AOM should be made in children who present with:
• Moderate to severe bulging of the TM or new-­onset otorrhea not
caused by otitis externa
• Mild bulging of the TM and recent (<48 hours) onset of ear pain or
intense TM erythema
A diagnosis of AOM should not be made in children without MEE.
AOM and OME may evolve into the other without any clearly differentiating physical findings; any schema for distinguishing between
them is to some extent arbitrary. In an era of increasing bacterial resistance, distinguishing between AOM and OME is important in determining treatment, because OME in the absence of acute infection does
not require antimicrobial therapy. Purulent otorrhea of recent onset
is indicative of AOM. Difficulty in distinguishing clinically between
AOM and OME is limited to circumstances in which purulent otorrhea is not present. Both AOM without otorrhea and OME are accompanied by physical signs of MEE, namely, the presence of at least two of
three TM abnormalities: white, yellow, amber, or (rarely) blue discoloration; opacification other than that caused by scarring; and decreased
or absent mobility. Alternatively, in OME, either air-­fluid levels or air
bubbles outlined by small amounts of fluid may be visible behind the
TM, a condition often indicative of impending resolution (see Fig.
680.4).
To support a diagnosis of AOM instead of OME in a child with MEE,
distinct fullness or bulging of the TM may be present, with or without
accompanying erythema, or, at a minimum, MEE should be accompanied by ear pain that appears clinically important. Unless intense,
erythema alone is insufficient because erythema, without other abnormalities, may result from crying or vascular flushing. In AOM, the malleus may be obscured, and the TM may resemble a bagel without a hole
but with a central depression (see Fig. 680.3). Rarely, the TM may be
obscured by surface bullae or may have a cobblestone appearance. Bullous myringitis is a physical manifestation of AOM and not an etiologically discrete entity. Within days after onset, fullness of the membrane
may diminish, even though infection may still be present.
In OME, bulging of the TM is absent or slight or the membrane
may be retracted (Fig. 680.4); erythema also is absent or slight but may
increase with crying or with superficial trauma to the external auditory
canal incurred in clearing the canal of cerumen.
Both before and after episodes of OM and also in the absence of OM,
the TM may be retracted as a consequence of negative middle-­ear air
pressure. The presumed cause is diffusion of air from the middle-­ear

cavity more rapidly than it is replaced via the eustachian tube. Mild
retraction is generally self-­limited, although in some children it is
accompanied by mild conductive hearing loss. More extreme retraction is of concern, as discussed later in the section on sequelae of OM.

Conjunctivitis-­Associated Otitis Media

Simultaneous appearance of purulent and erythematous conjunctivitis with an ipsilateral OM is a well-­recognized presentation, caused by
nontypeable H. influenzae in most children. The disease often is present in multiple family members and affects young children and infants.
Topical ocular antibiotics are ineffective. In an era of resistant organisms, this clinical association can be important in antibiotic selection,
with oral antibiotics (see later) effective against resistant forms of nontypeable H. influenzae.

Asymptomatic Purulent Otitis Media

Rarely, a child will present during a routine exam without fever, irritability, or other overt signs of infection, but on exam, the patient will
demonstrate an obvious purulent MEE and bulging TM. Although an
uncommon presentation of “acute” OM, the bulging nature of the TM
and the obvious purulence of the effusion do warrant antimicrobial
therapy.

Tympanometry

Tympanometry, or acoustic immittance testing, is a simple, rapid,
atraumatic test that, when performed correctly, offers objective evidence of the presence or absence of MEE. The tympanogram provides
information about TM compliance in electroacoustic terms that can
be thought of as approximately equivalent to TM mobility as perceived
visually during pneumatic otoscopy. The absorption of sound by the
TM varies inversely with its stiffness. The stiffness of the membrane
is least, and its compliance is greatest, when the air pressures impinging on each of its surfaces—middle-­ear air pressure and external canal
air pressure—are equal. Anything tending to stiffen the TM, such as
TM scarring or middle-­ear fluid, reduces the TM compliance, which
is recorded as a flattening of the curve of the tympanogram. An ear
filled with middle-­ear fluid generally has a very noncompliant TM and
therefore a flattened tympanogram tracing.
Tympanograms may be grouped into one of three categories (Fig.
680.5). Tracings characterized by a relatively steep gradient, sharp-­
angled peak, and middle-­ear air pressure (location of the peak in
terms of air pressure) that approximates atmospheric pressure (see
Fig. 680.5A) (type A curve) are assumed to indicate normal middle-­
ear status. Tracings characterized by a shallow peak or no peak are
often termed “flat” or type B (see Fig. 680.5B) and usually are assumed
to indicate the presence of a middle-­ear abnormality that is causing
decreased TM compliance. The most common such abnormality in
infants and children is MEE. Tracings characterized by intermediate
findings—somewhat shallow peak, often in association with a gradual
gradient (obtuse-­angled peak) or negative middle-­ear air pressure peak

A

(often termed type “C”), or combinations of these features (see Fig.
680.5C)—may or may not be associated with MEE and must be considered nondiagnostic or equivocal with respect to OM. However, type
C tympanograms do suggest eustachian tube dysfunction and some
ongoing pathology in the middle ear and warrant follow-­up.
When reading a tympanogram, it is important to look at the volume measurement. The type B tympanometric response is analyzed
within the context of the recorded volume. A flat, “low”-­volume (≤1
mL) tracing typically reflects the volume of the ear canal only, representing MEE, which impedes the movement of an intact eardrum. A
flat, high-­volume (>1 mL) tracing typically reflects the volume of the
ear canal and middle-­ear space, representing a perforation (or patent
tympanostomy tube) in the TM. In a child with a tympanostomy tube
present, a flat tympanogram with a volume <1 mL would suggest a
plugged or nonfunctioning tube and middle-­ear fluid, whereas a flat
tympanogram with a volume >1 mL would suggest a patent tympanostomy tube.
Although tympanometry is quite sensitive in detecting MEE, it can
be limited by patient cooperation, the skill of the individual administering the test, and the age of the child, with less reliable results in very
young children. Use of tympanometry may be helpful in office screening, may supplement the examination of difficult-­to-­examine patients,
and may help to identify patients who require further attention because
their tympanograms are abnormal. Tympanometry also may be used
to help confirm, refine, or clarify questionable otoscopic findings; to
objectify the follow-­up evaluation of patients with known middle-­ear
disease; and to validate otoscopic diagnoses of MEE. Even though tympanometry can predict the probability of MEE, it cannot distinguish
the effusion of OME from that of AOM.

PREVENTION

General measures to prevent OM that have been supported by numerous investigations include avoiding exposure to individuals with
respiratory infection, appropriate vaccination strategies against pneumococci and influenzae, avoiding environmental tobacco smoke, and
breast milk feeding.

IMMUNOPROPHYLAXIS AND VACCINATION
STATUS

Heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) reduced the
overall number of episodes of AOM by only 6–8% but with a 57%
reduction in serotype-­specific episodes. Reductions of 9–23% are seen
in children with histories of frequent episodes, and a 20% reduction is
seen in the number of children undergoing tympanostomy tube insertion. The 13-­valent pneumococcal polysaccharide-­protein conjugate
vaccine (PCV13) contains the seven serotypes included in PCV7 (serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) and six additional serotypes
(serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A). Early data indicate a significant
reduction in the number of invasive pneumococcal mastoiditis cases
since the introduction of PCV13. With the widespread use of PCV13,

continued surveillance will be necessary to detect other emerging serotypes, which are also demonstrating increasing resistance. Although
the influenza vaccine also provides a measure of protection against
OM, the relatively limited time during which individuals and even
communities are exposed to influenza viruses limits the vaccine’s effectiveness in broadly reducing the incidence of OM. Limitation of OM
disease is only a portion of the benefit realized from the vaccinations
for pneumococci and influenza viruses.

TREATMENT
Management of Acute Otitis Media

AOM can be very painful. Whether or not antibiotics are used for
treatment, pain should be assessed and, if present, treated (Table
680.1). Individual episodes of AOM have traditionally been treated
with antimicrobial drugs, and a sharp decline in complications from
AOM during the last half-­century seems, at least in part, attributable
to the widespread routine use of antimicrobials. However, concerns
about increasing bacterial resistance have prompted consideration for
withholding antimicrobial treatment in certain, well-­defined clinical
situations (Table 680.2). Although viral and bacterial pathogens have
been cultured from middle-­ear fluid obtained by tympanocentesis,
two factors may argue in favor of prescribing antimicrobial therapy for
children who have AOM. First, symptomatic improvement and resolution of infection may occur more promptly and more consistently with
antimicrobial treatment than without, even though most untreated
cases eventually resolve. Second, prompt and adequate antimicrobial
treatment may prevent the development of suppurative complications. Whereas data from the Netherlands in the 1990s suggested an

increased incidence of acute mastoiditis with watchful waiting as the
initial approach to treatment of AOM, other studies from several countries have contradicted these findings, demonstrating no increased
incidence in acute mastoiditis with changes in recommendations for
more conservative antimicrobial prescribing practices.
Given that most episodes of OM will spontaneously resolve, consensus guidelines have been published to assist clinicians who wish to
consider a period of “watchful waiting” or observation before treating
AOM with antibiotics (see Table 680.2 and Table 680.3; Fig. 680.6). The
most important aspect of these guidelines is that close follow-­up of the
patient must be ensured to assess for lack of spontaneous resolution or
worsening of symptoms and that patients should be provided with adequate analgesic medications (acetaminophen, ibuprofen) during the
period of observation. When pursuing the practice of watchful waiting in patients with AOM, the certainty of the diagnosis, the patient’s
age, and the severity of the disease should be considered. For patients
<2 years of age, it is recommended to treat all confirmed diagnoses of
AOM. In patients, <6 months of age, even presumed episodes of AOM
should be treated because of the increased potential of significant morbidity from infectious complications. In children between 6 and 24
months of age who have a questionable diagnosis of OM but severe
disease, defined as temperature of >39°C (102°F), significant otalgia,
or toxic appearance, antibiotic therapy is also recommended. Children in this age-­group with a questionable diagnosis and nonsevere
disease can be observed for a period of 2-­3 days with close follow-­up.
In children older than 2 years of age, observation might be considered
in all episodes of nonsevere OM or episodes of questionable diagnosis,
whereas antibiotic therapy is reserved for confirmed, severe episodes
of AOM. Information from Finland suggests that the “watchful waiting” or delayed treatment approach does not worsen the recovery from
AOM or increase the complication rates.
Accurate diagnosis is the most crucial aspect of the treatment of
OM. In studies using stringent criteria for diagnosis of AOM, the benefit of antimicrobial treatment is enhanced. In addition, subpopulations
of patients clearly receive more benefit from oral antimicrobial therapy
than others. Younger children, children with otorrhea, and children with
bilateral AOM have a significantly enhanced benefit from antimicrobial
therapy in comparison with older children, children without otorrhea, or
children with unilateral AOM.

Bacterial Resistance

Persons at greatest risk of harboring resistant bacteria are those who
are younger than 2 years of age; who are in regular contact with large
groups of other children, especially in daycare settings; or who recently
have received antimicrobial treatment. The development of resistant
bacterial strains and their rapid spread have been fostered and facilitated by selective pressure resulting from extensive use of antimicrobial drugs, the most common target of which in children is OM. Many
strains of each of the pathogenic bacteria that commonly cause AOM
are resistant to commonly used antimicrobial drugs.
Although antimicrobial resistance rates vary between countries, in the
United States approximately 40% of strains of nontypeable H. influenzae

4010 Part XXVIII u The Ear
and almost all strains of M. catarrhalis are resistant to aminopenicillins
(e.g., ampicillin and amoxicillin). In most cases the resistance is attributable to production of β-­lactamase and can be overcome by combining
amoxicillin with a β-­lactamase inhibitor (clavulanate) or by using a β-­
lactamase–stable antibiotic. Occasional strains of nontypeable H. influenzae that do not produce β-­lactamase are resistant to aminopenicillins
and other β-­lactam antibiotics by virtue of alterations in their penicillin-­
binding proteins. It is worth noting that bacterial resistance rates in
Northern European countries where antibiotic use is not routine are lower
(β-­lactamase resistance in 6–10% of isolates) than in the United States.
In the United States, approximately 50% of strains of S. pneumoniae are penicillin-­nonsusceptible, divided approximately equally
between penicillin-­intermediate and, even more difficult to treat,
penicillin-­resistant strains. A much higher incidence of resistance
is seen in children attending daycare. Resistance by S. pneumoniae
to the penicillins and other β-­lactam antibiotics is mediated not by
β-­lactamase production but by alterations in penicillin-­binding proteins. This mechanism of resistance can be overcome if higher concentrations of β-­lactam antibiotics at the site of infection can be achieved
for a sufficient time interval. Many penicillin-­resistant strains of S.
pneumoniae are also resistant to other antimicrobial drugs, including sulfonamides, macrolides, and cephalosporins. In general, as
penicillin resistance increases, so also does resistance to other antimicrobial classes. Resistance to macrolides, including azithromycin
and clarithromycin, by S. pneumoniae has increased, rendering these
antimicrobials far less effective in treating AOM. One mechanism
of resistance to macrolides also results in resistance to clindamycin,
which otherwise is effective against resistant strains of S. pneumoniae.
Unlike resistance to β-­lactam antibiotics, macrolide resistance cannot
be overcome by increasing the dose.

First-­Line Antimicrobial Treatment

Amoxicillin remains the drug of choice for uncomplicated AOM under
many circumstances because of its excellent safety record, relative efficacy, palatability, and low cost. Amoxicillin is the most efficacious of
available oral antimicrobial drugs against both penicillin-­susceptible
and penicillin-­
nonsusceptible strains of S. pneumoniae. Increasing the dose from the traditional 40-­45 mg/kg/day to 80-­90 mg/kg/
day will generally provide efficacy against penicillin-­intermediate and
some penicillin-­resistant strains. This higher dose should be used particularly in children younger than 2 years old, in children who have
recently received treatment with β-­
lactam drugs, and in children
who are exposed to large numbers of other children because of their
increased likelihood of an infection with a nonsusceptible strain of S.
pneumoniae. A limitation of amoxicillin is that it may be inactivated
by the β-­lactamases produced by many strains of nontypeable H. influenzae and most strains of M. catarrhalis. However, episodes of AOM
caused by these two pathogens often resolve spontaneously.
Allergies to penicillin antibiotics should be categorized into type I
hypersensitivity, consisting of urticaria or anaphylaxis, and those that
fall short of type I reactions, such as rash formation. For children with
a non–type I reaction in which cross reactivity with cephalosporins is
less of a concern, first-­line therapy with cefdinir would be an appropriate choice. In children with a type I reaction or known sensitivity
to cephalosporin antibiotics, there are far fewer choices. Resistance to
trimethoprim-­sulfamethoxazole by many strains of both nontypeable
H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae and a reported high clinical failure
rate in children with AOM treated initially with this antimicrobial
argue against its use. Similarly, increasing rates of macrolide resistance
argue against the efficacy of azithromycin. Because of concerns for
arthropathy and damage to weight-­bearing bones in animal models,
fluoroquinolone use in children has been limited; fluoroquinolone use
is recommended in certain clinical situations and/or when alternative
therapies are deemed suboptimal. Early alternative management in
allergic patients with tympanostomy tubes can allow for lessening of the
severity of their disease and the use of topical antimicrobials.

Duration of Treatment

The duration of treatment of AOM has historically been set at 10 days,
and most efficacy studies examining antimicrobial treatment in AOM

have used this duration as a benchmark. Studies comparing shorter
with longer durations of antimicrobial treatment have reported higher
treatment failure rates in younger children, particularly those younger
than 2 years old. Antibiotic courses shorter than 10 days, more severe
disease, exposure to larger groups of other children, such as in daycare
settings, and in children with a history of OME are also associated with
higher treatment failure rates. The clinical practice guidelines published in 2013 by the American Academy of Pediatrics suggest shorter
durations of antibiotic therapy may be adequate for treatment of AOM
in children older than 2 years. However, compelling evidence substantiating the efficacy of shorter antibiotic courses to treat AOM in older
children is limited.
Most patients improve within 72 hours; however, patients should not
stop therapy. If there are persistent symptoms after 72 hours of therapy,
the child should be reexamined for persistent OM or a complication
such as mastoiditis (see Chapter 681).

Follow-­Up

The principal goals of follow-­up are to assess the outcome of treatment and to differentiate between inadequate response to treatment
and early recurrence. The appropriate interval for follow-­up should
be individualized. Follow-­up within days is advisable in the young
infant with a severe episode or in a child of any age with continuing
pain. Follow-­up within 2 weeks is appropriate for the infant or young
child who has been having frequent recurrences. At that point, the
TM is not likely to have returned to normal, but substantial improvement in its appearance should be evident. In the child with only a
sporadic episode of AOM and prompt symptomatic improvement,
follow-­up 1 month after initial examination is early enough, or in
older children, no follow-­up may be necessary. The continuing presence of MEE alone after an episode of AOM is not an indication for
additional or second-­line antimicrobial treatment. However, persisting MEE does warrant additional follow-­up to ensure that the effusion resolves and does not lead to persisting hearing loss or other
complications.

Unsatisfactory Response to First-­Line Treatment

AOM is essentially a closed-­
space infection, and its resolution
depends both on eradication of the offending organism and restoration of middle-­ear ventilation. Factors contributing to unsatisfactory
response to first-­line treatment, in addition to inadequate antimicrobial efficacy, include poor compliance with treatment regimens,
concurrent or intercurrent viral infection, persistent eustachian tube
dysfunction and middle-­ear under-­aeration, reinfection from other
sites or from incompletely eradicated middle-­
ear pathogens, and
immature or impaired host defenses. The identification of biofilm formation in the middle ear of children with chronic OM also indicates
that, in some children, eradication with standard antimicrobial therapy is likely to be unsuccessful. Despite these many potential factors,
switching to an alternative or second-­line drug is reasonable when
there has been inadequate improvement in symptoms or in middle-­
ear status as reflected in the appearance of the TM or when the persistence of purulent nasal discharge suggests that the antimicrobial drug
being used has less-­than-­optimal efficacy. Second-­line drugs may also
appropriately be used when AOM develops in a child already receiving antimicrobial therapy, or in an immunocompromised child, or in
a child with severe symptoms whose previous experience with OM has
been problematic.

Second-­Line Treatment

When treatment of AOM with a first-­line antimicrobial drug has
proven inadequate, numerous second-­line alternatives are available
(see Table 680.3). Drugs chosen for second-­line treatment should be
effective against β-­
lactamase–producing strains of nontypeable H.
influenzae and M. catarrhalis and against susceptible and most nonsusceptible strains of S. pneumoniae. Because high-­dose amoxicillin
(80-­90 mg/kg/day) is effective against most strains of S. pneumoniae
and because the addition of clavulanate extends the effective antibacterial spectrum of amoxicillin to include β-­lactamase–producing bacteria, high-­dose amoxicillin-­clavulanate is particularly well-­suited as a

second-­line drug for treating AOM. The 14:1 amoxicillin-­clavulanate
formulation contains twice as much amoxicillin as the previously
available 7:1 formulation. Diarrhea, especially in infants and young
children, is a common adverse effect and usually is not severe enough
to require cessation of treatment. Cefdinir has demonstrated efficacy
in treatment, is generally well tolerated with respect to taste, and can
be given as a once-­daily regimen. The ability to also use cefdinir in
most children with mild type I hypersensitivity reactions has further
added to its favorable selection as a second-­line agent. Intramuscular
ceftriaxone has important limitations for use in young children; treatment entails both the pain of intramuscular injection and substantial
cost, and the injection may need to be repeated once or twice at 2-­day
intervals to achieve the desired degree of effectiveness. Nonetheless,
use of ceftriaxone is appropriate in severe cases of AOM when oral
treatment is not feasible, in highly selected cases after treatment failure
using orally administered second-­line antimicrobials, or when highly
resistant S. pneumoniae is found in aspirates obtained from diagnostic
tympanocentesis.
Clarithromycin and azithromycin have only limited activity against
nonsusceptible strains of S. pneumoniae and against β-­lactamase–producing strains of nontypeable H. influenzae. Macrolide use also appears
to be a major factor in causing increases in rates of resistance to macrolides by group A streptococcus and S. pneumoniae. Clindamycin is
active against most strains of S. pneumoniae, including resistant strains,
but is not active against nontypeable H. influenzae or M. catarrhalis.
Other antimicrobial agents that have been traditionally used in the
management of AOM have such significant lack of effectiveness against
resistant organisms that use seldom outweighs the potential side
effects or complications. This includes cefaclor, loracarbef, cefixime,
trimethoprim-­sulfamethoxazole, and erythromycin-­sulfisoxazole. Cefpodoxime has demonstrated reasonable effectiveness in some investigations but is generally poorly tolerated because of its taste.

ANTIMICROBIAL PROPHYLAXIS

In children who have developed frequent episodes of AOM, antimicrobial prophylaxis with subtherapeutic doses of an aminopenicillin or
a sulfonamide has been used in the past to provide protection against
recurrences of AOM (although not of OME). However, because of the
increased incidence of resistant organisms and the contribution of
antimicrobial usage to bacterial resistance, the risks of sustained antimicrobial prophylaxis clearly outweigh potential benefits.

Myringotomy and Tympanocentesis

Myringotomy is a long-­standing treatment for AOM but is not commonly needed in children receiving antimicrobials. Indications
for myringotomy in children with AOM include severe, refractory
pain; hyperpyrexia; complications of AOM such as facial paralysis,
mastoiditis, labyrinthitis, or central nervous system infection; and
immunologic compromise from any source. Myringotomy should
be considered as third-­line therapy in patients who have failed two
courses of antibiotics for an episode of AOM. In children with AOM
in whom clinical response to vigorous, second-­line treatment has been
unsatisfactory, either diagnostic tympanocentesis or myringotomy is
indicated to enable identification of the offending organism and its
sensitivity profile. Either procedure may be helpful in effecting relief
of pain. Tympanocentesis with culture of the middle-­ear aspirate may
also be indicated as part of the sepsis workup in very young infants
with AOM who show systemic signs of illness such as fever, vomiting,
or lethargy and whose illness accordingly cannot be presumed to be
limited to infection of the middle ear. Performing tympanocentesis can
be facilitated by use of a specially designed tympanocentesis aspirator. Studies reporting the use of strict, individualized criteria for the
diagnosis of AOM that include office tympanocentesis with bacterial
culture followed by culture-­guided antimicrobial therapy demonstrate
significant reduction in the frequency of recurrent AOM episodes
and tympanostomy tube surgery. However, many primary care physicians do not feel comfortable performing this procedure, there is the
potential for complications, and parents may view this procedure as

4011

traumatic. Often, children requiring this intervention have a strong
enough history of recurrent OM to warrant the consideration of tympanostomy tube placement, so that the procedure can be performed
under general anesthesia.

Early Recurrence After Treatment

Recurrence of AOM after apparent resolution may be caused by either
incomplete eradication of infection in the middle ear or upper respiratory tract reinfection by the same or a different bacteria or bacterial
strain. Recent antibiotic therapy predisposes patients to an increased
incidence of resistant organisms, which should also be considered in
choosing therapy, and, generally, initiating therapy with a second-­line
agent is advisable (see Table 680.3).

Myringotomy and Insertion of Tympanostomy Tubes

When AOM is recurrent, despite appropriate medical therapy, consideration of surgical management of AOM with tympanostomy tube
insertion is warranted. Although this surgical procedure may improve
the quality of life in patients with recurrent AOM, some studies have
suggested the procedure is effective at reducing the rate of AOM,
whereas others found postprocedure rates of AOM were no different
than patients managed with antibiotics. Individual patient factors,
including the risk profile, severity of AOM episodes, child’s development and age, presence of a history of adverse drug reactions, concurrent medical problems, and parental wishes, will affect the timing of a
decision to consider referral for this procedure. When a patient experiences three episodes of AOM in a 6-­month period or four episodes
in a 12-­month period with one episode in the preceding 6 months,
potential surgical management of the child’s AOM should be discussed
with the parents. Guidelines on tympanostomy tube placement indicate that if MEE is persistent in one or two ears and present at the time
of evaluation by the otolaryngologist, then myringotomy is indicated.
However, if MEE has cleared, the guidelines recommend holding off on
myringotomy and offering observation unless there are additional considerations such as difficulty with tolerating antibiotic therapy (allergic
concerns or other tolerance difficulties), severe episodes of acute OM,
or other developmental considerations. Not infrequently, one or more
of these additional considerations do affect a child’s care.

AOM-­Associated Tube Otorrhea

Although tympanostomy tubes may reduce the incidence of AOM in
some children, patients with tympanostomy tubes may still develop
AOM. One advantage of tympanostomy tubes in children with recurrent AOM is that if patients do develop an episode of AOM with a
functioning tube in place, these patients will manifest purulent drainage from the tube. By definition, children with functioning tympanostomy tubes without otorrhea do not have bacterial AOM as a cause
for a presentation of fever or behavioral changes and should not be
treated with oral antibiotics. If tympanostomy tube otorrhea develops,
ototopical treatment, and not oral antibiotics, should be considered
as first-­line therapy. With a functioning tube in place, the infection is
able to drain, there is usually negligible pain associated with the infection, and the possibility of developing a serious complication from an
episode of AOM is remote. Importantly, strict water precautions after
tympanostomy tube placement do not appear to affect the occurrence
of posttympanostomy otorrhea, and as such, water precautions are no
longer recommended in children with myringotomy tubes. However,
when otorrhea does occur, it is important to keep the ear canal dry
while ototopical treatment is administered. The current quinolone otic
drops approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in
the middle-­ear space in children are formulated with ciprofloxacin/
dexamethasone (Ciprodex) and ofloxacin (Floxin). The topical delivery
of these otic drops allows them to use a higher antibiotic concentration than can be tolerated by administering oral antibiotics, and they
have excellent coverage of even the most resistant strains of common
middle-­ear pathogens, as well as coverage of S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The high rate of success of these topical preparations,
their broad coverage, the lower likelihood of their contributing to the

4012 Part XXVIII u The Ear
development of resistant organisms, the relative ease of administration, the lack of significant side effects, and the lack of ototoxicity make
them the first choice for tube otorrhea. Oral antibiotic therapy should
be reserved for cases of tube otorrhea that have other associated systemic symptoms, patients who have difficulty in tolerating the use of
topical preparations, or, possibly, patients who have failed an attempt
at topical otic drops. Despite these advantages of ototopical therapy,
survey data have indicated that, compared with otolaryngologists, primary care practitioners are less likely to prescribe ototopicals as first-­
line therapy in tympanostomy tube otorrhea.
As a result of the relative ease in obtaining fluid for culture and
the possibility of the development of fungal otitis, which has shown
an increase with the use of broad-­spectrum quinolone ototopicals,
patients who fail topical therapy should also have culture performed.
Other otic preparations are available; although these either have some
risk of ototoxicity or have not received approval for use in the middle
ear, many of these preparations were widely used before the development of the current quinolone drops and were generally considered
reasonably safe and effective. In all cases of tube otorrhea, attention to
aural toilet (e.g., cleansing the external auditory canal of secretions and
avoidance of external ear water contamination) is important. In some
cases, with very thick, tenacious discharge, topical therapy may be
inhibited due to lack of delivery of the medication to the site of infection. Suctioning and removal of the secretions, often done through
referral to an otolaryngologist, may be quite helpful. When children
with tube otorrhea fail to improve satisfactorily with conventional outpatient management, they may require tube removal, hospitalization to
receive parenteral antibiotic treatment, or both.

MANAGEMENT OF OTITIS MEDIA WITH EFFUSION

Management of OME depends on an understanding of its natural history and its possible complications and sequelae. Children with OME
should be assessed for any baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or
behavioral factors that may portend risk of learning problems from
MEE. Moreover, clinicians should evaluate developmentally at-­risk
children for OME at the time of diagnosis of an at-­risk condition such
as Down syndrome, autism, speech and language delay, permanent
hearing loss, craniofacial syndromes, cleft palate, blindness, or global
developmental delay and at 12-­18 months of age (if diagnosed as being
at risk before this time). However, children who do not have symptoms that could be attributed to OME, such as hearing difficulties, ear
discomfort, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance,
or behavioral problems, and are not at developmental risk should not
be routinely screened for OME. When MEE persists for longer than
3 months, an age-­appropriate hearing test and consideration of referral to an otolaryngologist are appropriate. In older children (generally
older than 4 years) and depending on the expertise in the primary
care office, hearing screening may be achieved in primary care. For
any child who fails a hearing screening in the primary care office,
referral to an otolaryngologist is warranted. In considering the decision to refer the patient for consultation, the clinician should attempt
to determine the impact of the OME on the child and educate the
family in this regard. Most cases of OME resolve without treatment
within 3 months. For children with OME being managed expectantly,
the guidelines for management of OME recommend examination
should be performed at 3-­to 6-­month intervals, until the effusion is
no longer present, significant hearing loss is identified, or structural
abnormalities of the eardrum or middle ear are suspected. Although
hearing loss may be of primary concern, OME causes several other
difficulties in children that should also be considered. These include
predisposition to recurring AOM, pain, disturbance of balance, and
tinnitus. In addition, long-­term sequelae that have been demonstrated
to be associated with OME include pathologic middle-­ear changes,
atelectasis of the TM and retraction pocket formation, adhesive OM,
cholesteatoma formation and ossicular discontinuity, and conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Long-­term adverse effects on
speech, language, cognitive, and psychosocial development have also
been demonstrated. This impact is related to the duration of effusion
present, whether the effusion is unilateral or bilateral, the degree of

underlying hearing loss, and other developmental and social factors
affecting the child. In considering the impact of OME on development, it is especially important to take into consideration the overall
presentation of the child. Although it is unlikely that OME causing
unilateral hearing loss in the mild range will have long-­term negative
effects on an otherwise healthy and developmentally normal child,
even a mild hearing loss in a child with other developmental or speech
delays certainly has the potential to compound this child’s difficulties
(Table 680.4). At a minimum, children with OME persisting longer
than 3 months deserve close monitoring of their hearing levels with
skilled audiologic evaluation, frequent assessment of developmental
milestones, including speech and language assessment, and attention
paid to their rate of recurrent AOM.

Variables Influencing Otitis Media with Effusion
Management Decisions

Patient-­related variables that affect decisions on how to manage OME
include the child’s age, the frequency and severity of previous episodes
of AOM and interval since the last episode, the child’s current speech
and language development, presence of a history of adverse drug reactions, concurrent medical problems, or risk factors such as daycare
attendance, and parental wishes. In considering surgical management
of OME with tympanostomy tubes, particular benefit is seen in patients
with persisting OME punctuated by episodes of AOM, because the
tubes may provide resolution of both conditions. Persistence of MEE
after recurrent AOM (three episodes in 6 months or four in 12 months)
may be treated with tympanostomy tube placement. Disease-­related
variables that most otolaryngologists consider in the treatment of
OME include whether the effusion is unilateral or bilateral, the apparent quantity of effusion, the duration if known, the degree of hearing
impairment, the presence or absence of other possibly related symptoms (such as tinnitus, vertigo, or disturbance of balance), and the
presence or absence of mucopurulent or purulent rhinorrhea, which, if
sustained for longer than 2 weeks, would suggest that concurrent nasopharyngeal or paranasal sinus infection is contributing to continuing
compromise of middle-­ear ventilation.

Medical Treatment

Antimicrobials have demonstrated limited efficacy in resolving OME,
presumably because they help to eradicate nasopharyngeal infection,
unapparent middle-­ear infection, or both. The most significant effects
of antibiotics for OME have been shown with treatment durations of
4 weeks and 3 months. However, with the risk of bacterial antimicrobial resistance, the small potential benefit of antimicrobial therapy is
outweighed by the negative potential of treatment and is not recommended. Instead, antibiotic treatment should be limited to cases in
which there is evidence of associated bacterial upper respiratory tract
infection or untreated middle-­ear infection. For this purpose, the most
broadly effective drug available should be used as recommended for
AOM.

The efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of OME has been
demonstrated to be short term. Therefore the risk-­to-­benefit ratio for
steroids is such that they are no longer recommended for treatment
of OME. Antihistamine-­decongestant combinations are not effective
in treating children with OME and are not indicated. Antihistamines
alone, decongestants alone, and mucolytic agents are also ineffective
and not recommended. The risk profile for decongestants and antihistamines in children are such that, unless there is some other medical
condition such as documented allergic disease for antihistamine therapy, these medications are contraindicated for OME treatment. Randomized controlled trials do not support the use of topical intranasal
steroid sprays to treat the manifestations of eustachian tube dysfunction, and their use for OME resolution is also not recommended. Inflation of the eustachian tube by the Valsalva maneuver or other means
has not demonstrated long-­term efficacy. Other “alternative” therapies,
including spinal manipulation, currently have no demonstrated efficacy or role in children with OME.

Myringotomy and Insertion of Tympanostomy Tubes

When OME persists despite an ample period of watchful waiting, generally 3-­6 months or perhaps longer in children with unilateral effusion, consideration of surgical intervention with tympanostomy tubes
is appropriate. Myringotomy alone, without tympanostomy tube insertion, permits evacuation of MEE and may sometimes be effective, but
often the incision heals before the middle-­ear mucosa returns to normal, and the effusion soon reaccumulates. Inserting a tympanostomy
tube offers the likelihood that middle-­ear ventilation will be sustained
for at least as long as the tube remains in place and functional. Tympanostomy tubes have a variable duration of efficacy based on design.
Tubes that are designed for a shorter duration, 6-­12 months, have a
lesser impact on disease-­free middle-­ear spaces in children. Some
studies comparing the efficacy of tympanostomy tube types, including shorter-­acting tubes, with watchful waiting provide a less helpful
assessment of the differences between these approaches. Tubes that are
somewhat longer acting, effective for 12-­18 months, are generally more
appropriate for most children undergoing tube placement. Regardless
of type, tympanostomy tube placement nearly uniformly reverses the
conductive hearing loss associated with OME. Occasional episodes of
obstruction of the tube lumen and premature tube extrusion may limit
the effectiveness of tympanostomy tubes, and tubes can also be associated with otorrhea. However, placement of tympanostomy tubes is
generally quite effective in providing resolution of OME in children.
Tympanostomy tubes generally extrude on their own but rarely require
surgical removal after several years in place. Sequelae after tube extrusion include residual perforation of the eardrum, tympanosclerosis,
localized or diffuse atrophic scarring of the eardrum (which may predispose to the development of a retraction pocket), residual conductive
hearing loss, and cholesteatoma. The more serious of these sequelae
are quite infrequent. Recurrence of MEE after the extrusion of tubes
does develop, especially in younger children. However, most children
without underlying craniofacial abnormalities require only one set of
tympanostomy tubes. In developed countries, immunologic maturity
and other developmental changes provide improved middle-­ear health
and resolution of chronic OME by the time of tube extrusion. However,
in some populations, including Australian Aboriginal people, Indigenous Nations in the United States, and Alaskan Natives, even with
an absence of craniofacial abnormalities, there is a preponderance of
chronic OME; these patients should have increased follow-­up after tube
extrusion. Because persistent OME may clear spontaneously during the
summer months, watchful waiting through the summer season may be
advisable in children with OME who are otherwise well and without
developmental or speech concerns. In considering surgical management of OME in children, primarily in those with bilateral disease and
hearing loss, it has been demonstrated that placement of tympanostomy tubes results in a significant improvement in their quality of life.

Adenoidectomy

Adenoidectomy may reduce the risk of subsequent recurrences of both
AOM and OME in older children who have undergone tube insertion

4013

and in whom, after extrusion of tubes, OM continues to be a problem. Efficacy appears to be independent of adenoid size and probably
derives from removal of the focus of infection in the nasopharynx
as a site of biofilm formation, chronic inflammation affecting eustachian tube function, and recurrent seeding of the middle ear via the
eustachian tube. Current guidelines state that adenoidectomy should
not be performed at the time of tympanostomy tube insertion in children younger than 4 years old unless a distinct indication exists (nasal
obstruction, chronic adenoiditis). However, in children older than 4
years, one should recommend tympanostomy tubes, adenoidectomy,
or both when surgery is performed for OME.

Complications of Acute Otitis Media

Most complications of AOM consist of the spread of infection to
adjoining or nearby structures, the development of chronicity, or both.
Suppurative complications are relatively uncommon in children in
developed countries but occur not infrequently in disadvantaged children whose medical care is limited. The complications of AOM may be
classified as either intratemporal or intracranial (Table 680.5).

Intratemporal Complications

Direct but limited extension of AOM leads to complications within the
local region of the ear and temporal bone. These complications include
dermatitis, TM perforation, chronic suppurative OM (CSOM), mastoiditis, petrositis, brain abscess, hearing loss, facial nerve paralysis,
cholesteatoma formation, and labyrinthitis.

Infectious Dermatitis

This is an infection of the skin of the external auditory canal resulting from contamination by purulent discharge from the middle ear.
The skin is often erythematous, edematous, and tender. Management
consists of proper hygiene combined with systemic antimicrobials and
ototopical drops as appropriate for treating AOM and tube otorrhea.

Tympanic Membrane Perforation

Rupture of the TM can occur with episodes of either AOM or OME.
Although damage to the TM from these episodes generally heals spontaneously, chronic perforations can develop in a small number of cases
and require further surgical intervention.

Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media

CSOM consists of persistent middle-­
ear infection with discharge
through a TM perforation. The disease is initiated by an episode of
AOM with rupture of the membrane. The mastoid air cells are invariably involved. The most common etiologic organisms are P. aeruginosa
and S. aureus; however, the typical AOM bacterial pathogens may also
be the cause, especially in younger children or in the winter months.
Treatment is guided by the results of microbiologic investigation. If an
associated cholesteatoma is not present, parenteral antimicrobial treatment combined with assiduous aural cleansing is likely to be successful
in clearing the infection, but in refractory cases, tympanomastoidectomy can be required.

Mastoiditis

Mastoiditis is an important complication associated with OM (see
Chapter 681).

Facial Paralysis

As it traverses the middle ear and mastoid bone, the facial nerve may be
affected by adjacent infection. Facial paralysis occurring as a complication of AOM is uncommon and often resolves after myringotomy and
parenteral antibiotic treatment. Facial paralysis in the presence of AOM
requires urgent attention because prolonged infection can result in the
development of permanent facial paralysis, which can have a devastating effect on a child. Facial paralysis in an infant or child requires complete and unequivocal examination of the TM and middle-­ear space.
Any difficulty in examination requires urgent consultation with an otolaryngologist. Any examination that demonstrates an ear abnormality
also requires urgent referral to an otolaryngologist. If facial paralysis

develops in a child with mastoid osteitis or with CSOM, mastoidectomy should be undertaken urgently.

Cholesteatoma

Cholesteatoma is a cystlike growth originating in the middle ear, lined
by keratinized, stratified squamous epithelium and containing desquamated epithelium and/or keratin (see Chapter 678; Fig. 680.7).
Acquired cholesteatoma develops most often as a complication of
long-­standing chronic OM. The condition also may develop from a deep
retraction pocket of the TM or as a consequence of epithelial implantation in the middle-­ear cavity from traumatic perforation of the TM
or insertion of a tympanostomy tube. Cholesteatomas tend to expand
progressively, causing bony resorption, often extend into the mastoid
cavity, and may extend intracranially with potentially life-­threatening
consequences. Acquired cholesteatoma commonly presents as a chronically draining ear in a patient with a history of previous ear disease.
Cholesteatoma should be suspected if otoscopy demonstrates an area
of TM retraction or perforation with white, caseous debris persistently
overlying this area. Along with otorrhea from this area, granulation
tissue or polyp formation identified in conjunction with this history
and presentation should prompt suspicion of cholesteatoma. The most
common location for cholesteatoma development is in the superior
portion of the TM (pars flaccida). Most patients also present with conductive hearing loss on audiologic evaluation. When cholesteatoma is
suspected, otolaryngology consultation should be sought immediately.
Delay in recognition and treatment can have significant long-­term
consequences, including the need for more extensive surgical treatment, permanent hearing loss, facial nerve injury, labyrinthine damage
with loss of balance function, and intracranial extension. The required
treatment for cholesteatoma is tympanomastoid surgery.
Congenital cholesteatoma is an uncommon condition generally
identified in younger patients (Fig. 680.8). The etiology of congenital
cholesteatoma is thought to be a result of epithelial implantation in the
middle-­ear space during otologic development in utero. Congenital

cholesteatoma most commonly presents in the anterior-­superior quadrant of the TM but can be found elsewhere. Congenital cholesteatoma
appears as a discrete, white opacity in the middle-­ear space on otoscopy. Unlike patients with acquired cholesteatoma, there is generally
not a strong history of OM or chronic ear disease, history of otorrhea,
or changes in the TM anatomy such as perforation or retraction. Similar to acquired cholesteatoma, many patients do have some degree of
abnormal findings on audiologic evaluation, unless identified very
early. Congenital cholesteatoma also requires surgical resection.

Labyrinthitis

Labyrinthitis occurs uncommonly as a result of the spread of infection from the middle ear and/or mastoid to the inner ear (see Chapter
682). Cholesteatoma or CSOM is the usual source. Symptoms and signs
include vertigo, tinnitus, nausea, vomiting, hearing loss, nystagmus,
and clumsiness. Treatment is directed at the underlying condition and
must be undertaken promptly to preserve inner-­ear function and prevent the spread of infection.

INTRACRANIAL COMPLICATIONS

Meningitis, epidural abscess, subdural abscess, focal encephalitis, brain
abscess (see Chapters 643, 644, and 681), transverse (lateral) and sigmoid sinus thrombosis and otitic hydrocephalus each may develop as
a complication of acute or chronic middle-­ear or mastoid infection
through direct extension, hematogenous spread, or thrombophlebitis.
Bony destruction adjacent to the dura is often involved, and a cholesteatoma may be present. In a child with middle-­ear or mastoid infection,
the presence of any systemic symptom, such as high spiking fevers,
headache, or lethargy of extreme degree or a finding of meningismus
or of any abnormal central nervous system sign on physical examination should prompt suspicion of an intracranial complication.
When an intracranial complication is suspected, lumbar puncture
should be performed only after imaging studies establish that there is no
evidence of mass effect or hydrocephalus. In addition to examination

of the cerebrospinal fluid, culture of middle-­ear exudate obtained via
tympanocentesis may identify the causative organism, thereby helping
to guide the choice of antimicrobial medications. Myringotomy should
be performed to permit middle-­ear drainage. Concurrent tympanostomy tube placement is preferable to allow for continued decompression of the “infection under pressure” that is the causative event leading
to intracranial spread of the infection.
Treatment of intracranial complications of OM requires urgent, otolaryngologic, and often, neurosurgical consultation, intravenous antibiotic therapy, drainage of mastoiditis, and tympanomastoidectomy
in patients with coalescent mastoiditis. Many brain abscesses may be
managed without drainage but require long-­
term broad-­
spectrum
antibiotic therapy (see Chapter 644).
Lateral (transverse) or sigmoid sinus thrombosis may be complicated by dissemination of infected thrombi with resultant development of septic infarcts in various organs. Diagnosis is confirmed by
MRI. Mastoidectomy may be required even in the absence of osteitis or coalescent mastoiditis, especially in the case of propagation or

embolization of infected thrombi. In the absence of coalescent mastoiditis, sinus thrombosis can often be treated with tympanostomy tube
placement, anticoagulation, and intravenous antibiotics. Otolaryngology consultation should be obtained before initiating this anticoagulation to coordinate the possible need for surgical intervention before
anticoagulation.
Otitic hydrocephalus, a form of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, or pseudotumor cerebri (see Chapter 645), is an uncommon
condition that consists of increased intracranial pressure without
dilation of the cerebral ventricles occurring in association with acute
or chronic OM or mastoiditis. The condition is commonly also associated with lateral sinus thrombosis, and the pathophysiology is
thought to involve obstruction by thrombus of intracranial venous
drainage into the neck, producing a rise in cerebral venous pressure
and a consequent increase in cerebrospinal fluid pressure. Symptoms
are those of increased intracranial pressure. Signs may include, in
addition to evidence of OM, paralysis of one or both lateral rectus
muscles and papilledema with or without visual acuity loss. MRI can
confirm the diagnosis. Treatment measures include the use of antimicrobials and medications such as acetazolamide or furosemide to
reduce intracranial pressure, mastoidectomy, repeated lumbar puncture, lumboperitoneal shunt, and ventriculoperitoneal shunt. If left
untreated, otitic hydrocephalus may result in loss of vision secondary
to optic atrophy.

Physical Sequelae

The physical sequelae of OM consist of structural middle-­ear abnormalities resulting from long-­standing middle-­ear inflammation. In
most instances, these sequelae are consequences of severe and/or
chronic infection, but some may also result from the noninfective
inflammation of long-­standing OME. The various sequelae may occur
singly or interrelatedly in various combinations.
Tympanosclerosis consists of whitish plaques in the TM and nodular deposits in the submucosal layers of the middle ear. The changes
involve hyalinization with deposition of calcium and phosphate crystals. Uncommonly, there may be associated conductive hearing loss. In
developed countries, probably the most common cause of tympanosclerosis is tympanostomy tube insertion.
Atelectasis of the TM is a descriptive term applied to either severe
retraction of the TM caused by high negative middle-­ear pressure
or loss of stiffness and medial prolapse of the membrane from long-­
standing retraction or severe or chronic inflammation. A retraction
pocket is a localized area of atelectasis. Atelectasis is often transient
and usually unaccompanied by symptoms, but a deep retraction pocket
may lead to erosion of the ossicles and adhesive otitis and may serve
as the nidus of a cholesteatoma. For a deep retraction pocket, and for
the unusual instance in which atelectasis is accompanied by symptoms

4016 Part XXVIII u The Ear
such as otalgia, tinnitus, or conductive hearing loss, the required treatment is tympanostomy tube insertion and, at times, tympanoplasty.
Patients with persisting atelectasis and retraction pockets should have
referral to an otolaryngologist.
Adhesive OM consists of proliferation of fibrous tissue in the
middle-­ear mucosa, which may, in turn, result in severe TM retraction,
conductive hearing loss, impaired movement of the ossicles, ossicular
discontinuity, and cholesteatoma. The hearing loss may be amenable to
surgical correction.
Cholesterol granuloma is an uncommon condition in which the TM
may appear to be dark blue secondary to middle-­ear fluid of this color.
Cholesterol granulomas are rare, benign cysts that occur in the temporal
bone. They are expanding masses that contain fluids, lipids, and cholesterol crystals surrounded by a fibrous lining and generally require surgical removal. Tympanostomy tube placement will not provide satisfactory
relief. This lesion requires differentiation from bluish middle-­ear fluid,
which can also rarely develop in patients with the more common OME.
Chronic perforation may rarely develop after spontaneous rupture
of the TM during an episode of AOM or from acute trauma, but more
commonly results as a sequela of CSOM or as a result of failure of TM
closure after extrusion of a tympanostomy tube. Chronic perforations
are generally accompanied by conductive hearing loss. Surgical repair
of a TM perforation is recommended to restore hearing, prevent infection from water contamination in the middle-­ear space, and prevent
cholesteatoma formation. Chronic perforations are almost always amenable to surgical repair, usually after the child has been free of OM for
an extended period.
Permanent conductive hearing loss (see Chapter 677) may result
from any of the conditions just described. Rarely, permanent sensorineural hearing loss may occur in association with acute or chronic
OM, secondary to spread of infection or products of inflammation
through the round window membrane, or as a consequence of suppurative labyrinthitis.

POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENTAL SEQUELAE

Permanent hearing loss in children has a significant negative impact
on development, particularly in speech and language. The degree to
which OM affects long-­term development in children is difficult to
assess, and there have been conflicting studies examining this question. Developmental impact is most likely to be significant in children
who have greater levels of hearing loss, hearing loss that is sustained
for longer periods, or hearing loss that is bilateral and in children who
have other developmental difficulties or risk factors for developmental
delay (see Table 680.4).

Chapter 681

Acute Mastoiditis
Brittany Player
Mastoiditis, a suppurative infection of the mastoid air cell system, is the
most common infectious complication of acute otitis media (AOM),
typically affecting younger children. Coalescent mastoiditis occurs
when the suppurative infection leads to bony breakdown of the fine
bony septa separating individual mastoid air cells.

ANATOMY

The temporal bone forms a portion of the skull base and has multiple
complex anatomic functions. The mastoid process is a pyramid-­shaped
outgrowth of the temporal bone. The inferior extent is attached to the
sternocleidomastoid muscle. The mastoid process borders the middle

cranial fossa, posterior cranial fossa, and sigmoid sinus. It is composed
of a system of interlinked mucosa-­lined air cells that communicate with
the middle ear space and contains the fallopian canal, which includes
the facial nerve, the chorda tympani supplying taste to the anterior two
thirds of the tongue, and the semicircular canal system. Because the
mastoid cavity is anatomically adjacent to the meninges, brain, venous
sinuses of the brain, facial nerve, and cervical lymph nodes, mastoiditis
often accompanies or precedes intracranial complications of AOM (see
Chapter 680).

EPIDEMIOLOGY

In the preantibiotic era, acute mastoiditis was a much more common complication of AOM with high rates of intracranial infectious
complications, morbidity, and mortality. Currently, mastoiditis is a
rare complication, occurring in approximately 1-­4 cases per 100,000
population of children <2 years old and less commonly among older
children. A multicenter study with 223 consecutive cases of acute
mastoiditis reported 28% of patients were younger than 1 year old,
38% of patients were between 1 and 4 years old, 22% of patients were
between 4 and 8 years old, and 8% of patients were between 8 and
18 years old. Some studies reported decreased incidence of acute
mastoiditis after introduction of the 7-­valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), whereas others reported no change or nominal
increases. One study reported a sharp decrease in acute mastoiditis
beginning in 2010, which coincided with licensure and widespread
use of the 13-­
valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13).
Another study, which included data from eight hospitals, found that
the proportion of PCV13 serotypes isolated from cases of mastoiditis decreased from 50% in 2011 to 29% in 2013, with most of the
decrease attributable to decreases in serotype 19A. Changes in rates
of mastoiditis are likely related to changing incidence of AOM in
response to pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Other factors influencing the occurrence of mastoiditis include rates of antibiotic prescriptions for AOM, access to healthcare, and rates of antimicrobial
resistance. Whereas groups in countries such as the Netherlands
and Iceland reported adherence to a watchful waiting strategy for
treatment of AOM, this resulted in slightly increased rates of acute
mastoiditis compared with countries where antibiotics are routinely
used to treat AOM. Other studies from several countries have contradicted these findings, demonstrating no increased incidence in acute
mastoiditis, with changes in recommendations for more conservative
antimicrobial prescribing practices. Despite large differences in antibiotic prescription rates in different countries, because of the overall
low incidence of acute mastoiditis, the number of children needed
to be treated with antibiotics to prevent one case of acute mastoiditis
ranges from 2,500 to 4,800. Some studies have reported an increase
in incidence, which has correlated with an increase in infections with
drug-­resistant bacteria. All-­cause mortality among children with
mastoiditis is 0.03%.

MICROBIOLOGY

Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most common pathogen
cultured from cases of acute mastoiditis (Table 681.1). After introduction of PCV7, pneumococcal serotype 19A was commonly associated with acute mastoiditis. This serotype is frequently resistant to

penicillin and macrolide antibiotics. PCV13 use has been associated
with fewer serotype 19A infections overall; its impact on the etiology of mastoiditis is less clear. Other bacteria commonly cultured
include Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and Haemophilus
influenzae. P. aeruginosa is more likely in patients with chronic
otitis media and/or cholesteatoma, older children, and those with
previous tympanostomy tubes, though higher rates of P. aeruginosa
recovery should suggest consideration of the method of sample collection when interpreting this culture result.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Acute mastoiditis and AOM present similarly in children. Ninety-­
seven percent of children with an acute mastoiditis have a coexisting AOM on the affected side. The remaining 3% of children with
acute mastoiditis either had a serous middle ear effusion at the time
of presentation or had a history of AOM within the past 2 weeks.
Other clinical manifestations include protrusion of the ear (87%),
retroauricular swelling and tenderness (67%), retroauricular erythema (87%), fever (60%), otalgia, and hearing loss (Tables 681.2
and 681.3). Prolonged symptoms during the treatment of AOM
may suggest concurrent mastoiditis. Children with acute mastoiditis were less likely to have bilateral infection. Some children do not
have external signs of infection.

DIAGNOSIS AND IMAGING

Acute mastoiditis is usually diagnosed based on history and clinical findings (see Table 681.2). CT scan of the temporal bone can

confirm the diagnosis, whereas head CT can identify intracranial
complications (see Chapter 680), including epidural abscess or
subdural empyema. Findings of acute mastoiditis include bony
demineralization, loss of bony septations in the mastoid cavity (Fig.
681.1), and, occasionally, subperiosteal abscess (Fig. 681.2). CT
scans have the advantage of being readily available in most emergency rooms, can quickly evaluate for intracranial complications,
and can identify whether there is bony destruction or a drainable
fluid collection. Contrast-­enhanced CT scan or MRI allows evaluation for vascular thrombosis (Fig. 681.3) and abscess formation.
MRI is generally reserved for patients in whom there is a suspected
intracranial complication (Figs. 681.4 and 681.5). Incidental detection of mastoid air cell opacification occurs in more than 20% of
children (and in 40% of children <2 years old) undergoing MRI
for other reasons, so imaging findings must be interpreted in the
appropriate clinical context.
There is a limited role for ultrasound in the diagnosis of acute
mastoiditis. Ultrasound can be used as a screening test when a postauricular subperiosteal abscess is suspected due to clinical findings such as protrusion of the pinna and retroauricular erythema.
If there is a fluid collection on ultrasound or concern for a defect
in the cranial vault, further imaging with a CT and/or MRI would
be recommended. Because ultrasound cannot identify intracranial
complications, its use must be limited to a highly selected patient
population.

MANAGEMENT

Acute mastoiditis is a rare complication of AOM, and there is a large
degree of overlap between the presentations of children with both
disease processes. For the pediatrician confronted with a majority of
uncomplicated AOM, it is difficult to decide when to initiate a more
extensive evaluation. Any time there is a purulent middle-­ear effusion
along with postauricular findings, acute mastoiditis needs to be in the
differential diagnosis. In general, children with acute mastoiditis will
appear sicker than children with uncomplicated AOM, and many of
them have already failed to respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy
for AOM. Focal neurologic deficits, including facial paresis, in a child
with AOM or mastoiditis suggest intracranial spread of infection. In
a child with suspected mastoiditis, it is critical to document normal
facial nerve function at the time of the initial exam so that if this complication does develop during treatment, the treating team is able to
document this complication.

the most sensitive readily available test and should be ordered upon
presentation.
Antibiotic therapy should initially be administered intravenously.
Empiric antibiotic selection may include a β-­lactam/β-­lactamase
inhibitor combination (e.g., ampicillin-­
sulbactam, piperacillin-­
tazobactam) or third-­generation cephalosporin (e.g., cefotaxime,
ceftriaxone). In children with chronically draining ears or concern for cholesteatoma, there is an increased incidence of gram-­
negative infection, and coverage should include antibiotics with
activity against Pseudomonas spp. (e.g., ceftazidime, cefepime). If
intracranial infection is suspected, broader-­spectrum antimicrobial
coverage (e.g., vancomycin plus a third-­generation cephalosporin)
should be initiated. In cases of uncomplicated acute mastoiditis
(e.g., absence of intracranial complications or localized abscess
formation), a 24-­to 48-­hour trial of intravenous antibiotics may
yield clinical improvement without surgical intervention. Therapy
should be adjusted when cultures and susceptibilities are available. The total duration of therapy is 4 weeks, with transition from
intravenous to oral therapy at discharge for those without intracranial complications. The optimal duration of intravenous therapy is
unknown, but some experts recommend a minimum of 7-­10 days
of intravenous therapy before oral transition, whereas others transition once the patient demonstrates clinical improvement and surgical intervention is no longer required.
Otolaryngology consultation can be helpful to assist with management and to determine whether surgical intervention would
be beneficial. Many patients will benefit from tympanostomy tube
placement at the time of the acute infection to allow localized ototopical antibiotic treatment and aspiration of middle-­ear fluid for
culture and sensitivity. In a patient with an additional extracranial
complication such as facial paresis, drainage of the middle-­ear space
with placement of a tympanostomy tube is required and should take
place urgently. A small group of patients may necessitate mastoidectomy—surgical removal of diseased bone and granulation tissue
in the mastoid cavity. At the time of surgery, a drain is often placed
to allow purulent secretions an egress. Indications for mastoidectomy include coalescent mastoiditis, postauricular abscess formation, infectious intracranial complication, and failure to respond to
appropriate IV antibiotics. When intracranial complications occur
or there are mental status changes, evaluation by otolaryngology
and neurosurgery and emergent mastoidectomy are indicated. Most
children with mastoiditis make a full recovery. Long-­term otologic
complications like sensorineural or conductive hearing loss are
uncommon. A posttreatment audiogram is often obtained to evaluate the hearing status after an infection.

When treating acute mastoiditis, several uncommon situations
require particular attention. Selecting empiric antibiotics for unvaccinated and undervaccinated children is challenging, and in this
patient population, it is especially important to obtain a sample
of middle-­ear fluid for Gram stain and culture to guide antibiotic therapy. There is an increased incidence of acute mastoiditis
in children with autism spectrum disorder. Immunocompromised
patients should be treated with more aggressive and prolonged
courses of antibiotic; they may benefit from more aggressive surgical treatment to remove infected tissue. Sigmoid sinus thrombosis
can occur secondary to acute mastoiditis. If this does occur, in addition to the standard treatment for acute mastoiditis, consideration
should be given to involving hematology and for administering
systemic anticoagulation. Otitic hydrocephalus, which is elevated
intracranial pressure after middle-­
ear infection, manifests with
emesis, headache, and visual impairment and is associated with lateral or sigmoid sinus thrombosis; management requires antibiotics,
anticoagulation, treatment of increased intracranial pressure, and
surgical decompression with drainage of the mastoid infection.

incidence of acute mastoiditis. Despite having a foreign body present in the middle ear and inner ear space, the majority of these

acute mastoiditis cases can be managed with tympanostomy tube
placement, intravenous antibiotic therapy, and incision and drainage of an abscess without removal of the device.
Although very rare, benign and malignant tumors can affect the
temporal bone of children. The presentation mimics that of chronic
otitis media and chronic mastoiditis, and this often leads to a delay in
diagnosis. Hearing loss, otalgia, and otorrhea are common symptoms.
The main differentiating factor is the protracted course of otorrhea and
refractory nature of symptoms despite appropriate medical therapy.
Aural polyps or a mass lesion may be present on physical exam. Potential causes include rhabdomyosarcoma, nonrhabdomyosarcomatous
sarcoma (including chondrosarcoma, chordoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing

histiocytosis (formerly histiocytosis X) (Fig. 681.6), lymphoma, and

The Inner Ear and
Diseases of the Bony
Labyrinth
Joseph Haddad Jr.
Genetic factors can affect the anatomy and function of the inner ear.
Infectious agents, including viruses, bacteria, and protozoa, also can
cause abnormal function, most commonly as sequelae of congenital
infection (see Table 677.2) or bacterial meningitis (see Chapter 643.1).
Other acquired diseases of the labyrinthine capsule include otosclerosis, osteopetrosis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis (see Chapter 556.1),
fibrous dysplasia, and other types of bony dysplasia. All of these can
cause both conductive hearing loss (CHL) and sensorineural hearing
loss (SNHL), as well as vestibular dysfunction.

OTHER DISEASES OF THE INNER EAR

Labyrinthitis (also called vestibular neuritis) may be a complication of direct spread of infection from acute or chronic otitis media
or mastoiditis and also can complicate bacterial meningitis as a result
of organisms entering the labyrinth through the internal auditory

meatus, endolymphatic duct, perilymphatic duct, vascular channels,
or hematogenous spread. Clinical manifestations of vestibular neuritis can include a sudden onset of rotatory vertigo, dysequilibrium,
postural imbalance (furniture walking) with falls to the affected side,
deep-­seated ear pain, nausea, vomiting, and spontaneous horizontal
(occasionally rotary) nystagmus.
The dizziness may last a few days, but balance issues, particularly
after rapid head movements toward the affected ear, may last for
months. Vestibular neuritis is usually unilateral and is not associated
with other neurologic defects; subjective hearing loss is unusual in
vestibular neuritis. If hearing loss is present, idiopathic SNHL should
be considered, as well as classical labyrinthitis (vestibular and cochlear
nerves). Treatment of vestibular neuritis may include prednisone and
vestibular rehabilitative exercises. Recurrent episodes should suggest
another diagnosis such as vestibular migraine or benign paroxysmal
positional vertigo.
In children, viral labyrinthitis is often associated with hearing loss.
Acute serous labyrinthitis, characterized by mild symptoms of vertigo
and hearing loss, most commonly develops secondary to middle-­ear
infection without direct invasion. Acute suppurative labyrinthitis,
characterized by abrupt, severe onset of these symptoms, may be caused
by bacterial meningitis or acute middle-­ear or mastoid infection via a
dehiscent horizontal semicircular canal. In these latter cases, a cholesteatoma is almost always present. Treatment of acute infectious labyrinthitis includes antimicrobial agents in cases of bacterial infection
or antiviral agents (acyclovir, valacyclovir) in cases of herpes zoster
oticus. Oral corticosteroids reduce labyrinthine inflammation and may
prevent sequelae. A short course (≤3 days) of vestibular suppressants
(dimenhydrinate 1-­2 mg/kg) alleviates acute symptoms such as nausea.
If it is secondary to otitis media, otologic surgery may be required to
remove underlying cholesteatoma or drain the middle ear and mastoid. Chronic labyrinthitis, most often associated with cholesteatoma,
manifests with SNHL and vestibular dysfunction that develops over
time; surgery is required to remove the cholesteatoma. Chronic labyrinthitis also occurs uncommonly secondary to long-­standing otitis
media, with the slow development of SNHL, usually starting in the
higher frequencies, and possibly with vestibular dysfunction. In addition, and more commonly, children with chronic middle-­ear fluid
often are unsteady or off balance, a situation that improves immediately
when the fluid resolves.
Vertigo and dizziness are common among older children and adolescents. Benign paroxysmal vertigo, the most common cause of vertigo in pediatric patients, is characterized by short periods of vertigo or
dizziness lasting seconds to a few minutes and associated with imbalance and nystagmus; tinnitus or hearing loss is unusual. Basilar/vestibular migraine is a common cause of episodic vertigo or dizziness
and is associated with headache (50–70% of patients), rotary or to-­
and-­fro nystagmus, and sensitivity to noise and bright light (see Chapter 635.1). Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is less common in
young children and more common with increasing age into adulthood.

posterior canal; symptoms occur with position changes of the head and
may last seconds to minutes. Vertigo and nystagmus may be demonstrated by changing position (sitting to lying down on the right or left).
Treatment involves canalith repositioning maneuvers to shift the debris
from the canals into the utricle. Additional etiologies of vertigo include
vestibular migraine, trauma, superior semicircular canal dehiscence,
isolated autoimmune inner ear disease or syndrome-­associated autoimmune diseases including Cogan syndrome (interstitial keratitis, vertigo, hearing loss), Vogt-­Koyanagi-­Harada syndrome (uveomeningitis,
vitiligo, vertigo, hearing loss), Susac syndrome (microangiopathy with
retinopathy, encephalopathy, deafness), granulomatosis with polyangiitis, mixed connective tissue disease, and, most rarely, CNS tumor.
Otosclerosis, an autosomal dominant disease that affects only
the temporal bones, causes abnormal bone growth that can result
in fixation of the stapes in the oval window, leading to progressive
hearing loss. In one series in North America, otosclerosis was found
in 0.6% of temporal bones of children younger than 5 years of age
and 4% of those ages 5-­18 years. The hearing loss is usually conductive at first, but SNHL can develop. Females are affected most commonly, with onset of otosclerosis in teenagers or young adults, often
associated with pregnancy. Corrective surgery to replace the stapes
with a mobile prosthesis often is successful.
Osteogenesis imperfecta is a systemic disease that can involve
both the middle and inner ears (see Chapter 742). Hearing loss
occurs in approximately 20% of young children and as many as 50%
of adults by the age of 50 with this disease. The hearing loss most
commonly is conductive but can be sensorineural or mixed. Etiologies of hearing loss include otosclerosis, ossicle fractures, or neural
degeneration. If the hearing loss is severe enough, a hearing aid may
be a preferable alternative to surgical correction of the fixed stapes,
because stapedectomy in children with osteogenesis imperfecta can
be technically very difficult, and the disease and the hearing loss
may be progressive.
Osteopetrosis, a very uncommon skeletal dysplasia, can involve the
temporal bone, including the middle ear and ossicles, usually resulting in a moderate to severe CHL. Recurrent facial nerve paralysis also
can occur because of excess bone deposition; with each recurrence, less
facial function might return (see Chapter 740).

Traumatic Injuries of the
Ear and Temporal Bone
Joseph Haddad Jr.
AURICLE AND EXTERNAL AUDITORY CANAL

Auricle trauma is common in certain sports. Hematoma, with accumulation of blood between the perichondrium and the cartilage,
can follow trauma to the pinna and is especially common in teenagers involved in wrestling or boxing. Prompt drainage of a hematoma
can prevent irreversible damage. Immediate needle aspiration or,
when the hematoma is extensive or recurrent, incision and drainage and a pressure dressing are necessary to prevent perichondritis,
which can result in cartilage loss and a “cauliflower ear deformity.”
Sports helmets should be worn when appropriate during activities
when head trauma is possible.

4021

Frostbite of the auricle should be managed by rapidly rewarming
the exposed pinna with warm irrigation or warm compresses.
Foreign bodies in the external canal are common in childhood.
Often these can be removed in the office setting without general
anesthesia if the child is mature enough to understand and cooperate and is properly restrained; if an adequate headlight, surgical
head otoscope, or otomicroscope is used for visualizing the object;
and if appropriate instruments such as alligator forceps, wire loops
or a blunt cerumen curette or suction are used, depending on the
shape of the object. Gentle irrigation of the ear canal with body-­
temperature water or saline may be used to remove very small
objects, but only if the tympanic membrane (TM) is intact. Attempts
to remove an object from a struggling child or with poor visualization and inadequate tools result in a terrified child with a swollen
and bleeding ear canal and can then mandate general anesthesia to
remove the object. Difficult foreign bodies, especially those that are
large, deeply embedded, or associated with canal swelling, are best
removed by an otolaryngologist and/or under general anesthesia.
Disk batteries are removed emergently because they leach a basic
fluid that can cause severe tissue destruction. Insects in the canal
are first killed with mineral oil or lidocaine and are then removed
under otomicroscopic examination. Objects retained in the external
auditory canal can lead to complications such as otalgia, conductive
hearing loss, infection, and aural drainage.
After a foreign body is removed from the external canal, the
TM should be inspected carefully for traumatic perforation,
middle-­e ar effusion, abrasions, and bleeding. If a foreign body has
resulted in acute inflammation of the canal, topical otic medications as described for acute external otitis should be instituted
(see Chapter 679).

TYMPANIC MEMBRANE AND MIDDLE EAR

Traumatic perforation of the TM usually results from sudden external compression, such as a slap, or penetration by a foreign object
such as a stick or cotton-­tipped swab. The perforation may be linear or stellate. It is most commonly in the anterior portion of the
pars tensa when it is caused by compression, and it may be in any
quadrant of the TM when caused by a foreign object. Systemic antibiotics and topical otic medications are not required unless suppurative otorrhea is present. Small traumatic TM perforations often
heal spontaneously, but it is important to evaluate and monitor
the patient’s hearing to ensure that spontaneous healing occurs. If
the TM does not heal within several months, surgical graft repair
should be considered. If a perforation is present, otorrhea can occur
from water entering the middle ear from the ear canal during swimming or bathing; appropriate precautions should be taken. Perforations resulting from penetrating foreign bodies are less likely to
heal than those caused by compression. Audiometric examination
reveals a conductive hearing loss, with larger air-­bone gaps seen
in larger perforations. Immediate surgical exploration may be indicated if the injury is accompanied by one or more of the following:
vertigo, nystagmus, severe tinnitus, moderate to severe hearing loss,
or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) otorrhea. At the time of exploration, it
is necessary to inspect the ossicles, especially the stapes, for possible dislocation or fracture and to clear sharp objects that might
have penetrated the oval or round windows. Sensorineural hearing
loss results if the stapes subluxates or dislocates into the oval window or if either the oval or round window is penetrated. Children
should not be given access to cotton-­tipped applicators, because the
applicators commonly cause ear trauma. Contact with small objects
should be limited to times of parental supervision.
Perilymphatic fistula can occur after barotrauma or an increase
in CSF pressure. It should be suspected in a child who develops
a sudden SNHL or vertigo after physical exertion, deep water
diving, air travel, playing a wind instrument, or significant head
trauma. The leak characteristically is at the oval (Fig. 683.1) or the
round window and may be associated with congenital abnormalities of these structures or an anatomic abnormality of the cochlea
or semicircular canals. Perilymphatic fistulas occasionally close

spontaneously, but immediate surgical repair of the fistula is recommended to control vertigo and to stop any progression of the SNHL;
even timely surgery does not usually restore the SNHL. No reliable
test is known for perilymphatic fistula, so middle-­ear exploration is
required for diagnosis and treatment.

TEMPORAL BONE FRACTURES

Children are particularly prone to basilar skull fractures, which
usually involve the temporal bone. Temporal bone trauma should
be considered in head injuries, and the status of the ear and hearing
should be evaluated. Temporal bone fractures are divided into longitudinal (70–80%), transverse (10–20%), and mixed. Longitudinal
fractures (Fig. 683.2) are commonly manifested by bleeding from
a laceration of the external canal or TM; postauricular ecchymosis

temporal bone is often signaled by postauricular ecchymotic discoloration, termed the Battle sign. B, The force of the blow may also cause
tearing of the ear canal or, as shown here, middle ear hemorrhage with
hemotympanum. Depending on the timing of examination, this may
appear red or blue. (B courtesy Michael Hawke, MD; from Zitelli BJ,

usually improves spontaneously); and temporary CSF otorrhea or
rhinorrhea (from CSF running down the eustachian tube) (Fig.
683.3). Transverse fractures of the temporal bone have a graver
prognosis than longitudinal fractures and are often associated with
immediate facial paralysis and damage to the labyrinth or internal
auditory canal. Facial paralysis might improve if caused by edema,
but surgical decompression of the nerve is often recommended if
there is no evidence of clinical recovery and facial nerve studies are
unfavorable. If the facial nerve has been transected, surgical decompression and anastomosis offer the possibility of some functional
recovery. Transverse fractures are also associated with severe SNHL,
vertigo, nystagmus, tinnitus, nausea, and vomiting associated with

loss of cochlear and vestibular function; hemotympanum; rarely,
external canal bleeding; and CSF otorrhea, either in the external
auditory canal or behind the TM, which can exit the nose via the
eustachian tube.
If temporal bone fracture is suspected or seen on radiographs, gentle examination of the pinna and ear canal is indicated; lacerations or
avulsion of soft tissue is common with temporal bone fractures. Vigorous removal of external auditory canal blood clots or tympanocentesis
is not indicated, because removing the clot can further dislodge the
ossicles or reopen CSF leaks. The effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent meningitis in patients with basilar skull fractures and
CSF otorrhea or rhinorrhea cannot be determined because studies to
date are flawed by biases. If a patient is afebrile and the drainage is
not cloudy, watchful waiting without antibiotics is indicated. Surgical
intervention is reserved for children who require repair of a nonhealing TM perforation, who have suffered dislocation of the ossicular
chain, or who need decompression of the facial nerve. SNHL can also
follow a blow to the head without an obvious fracture of the temporal
bone (labyrinthine concussion).

ACOUSTIC TRAUMA

Acoustic trauma results from exposure to high-­intensity sound (fireworks, gunfire, loud music, heavy machinery) and is initially manifested
by a temporary decrease in the hearing threshold, most commonly at
4,000 Hz on an audiometric examination, and tinnitus. If the sound is
between 85 and 140 dB, the loss is usually temporary (after a rock concert), but both the hearing loss and the tinnitus can become permanent
with chronic noise exposure; the frequencies from 3,000-­6,000 Hz are
most often involved. Sudden, extremely loud (>140 dB), short-­duration
noises with loud peak components (gunfire, bombs) can cause permanent hearing loss after a single exposure. Noise-­induced hearing loss
results from interactions between genes and the environment. A meta-­
analysis demonstrated that loud music exposure resulted in increased
hearing thresholds and decreased otoacoustic emissions in children
and adolescents. Ear protection and avoidance of chronic exposure to
loud noise are preventive measures. Hearing loss from chronic noise
exposure should be entirely preventable. Parents should be made aware
of the dangers of acoustic trauma, from the environment and from the
use of headphones, and should take measures to minimize exposure.
Treatment with high-­dose steroids for 1-­2 weeks should be considered
to treat acute hearing loss related to noise trauma.

Tumors of the Ear and
Temporal Bone
Joseph Haddad Jr.
Benign tumors of the external canal include osteomas and monostotic
and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. Osteomas are usually unilateral and
located lateral in the bony canal; they require removal only if hearing
is impaired or external otitis results. Exostoses (see Chapter 550.2), or
localized bony hyperplasias, may be confused with osteomas; however,
exostoses are usually bilateral and located in the region of the annulus
of the tympanic membrane. Masses occurring over the mastoid bone,
such as first branchial cysts, dermoid cysts, and lipomas, may be confused with primary mastoid tumors; imaging can help with the diagnosis and treatment plan.
Eosinophilic granuloma, which can occur in isolation or as part
of systemic Langerhans cell histiocytosis (see Chapter 556.1), should
be suspected in patients with otalgia, otorrhea (sometimes bloody),
hearing loss, abnormal tissue within the middle ear or ear canal, and
roentgenographic findings of a sharply delineated destructive lesion
of the temporal bone. Definitive diagnosis is made by biopsy. Treatment depends on the site of the lesion and histology. Depending on
the site, it may be treated by surgical excision, curettage, or local radiation. If the lesion is part of a systemic presentation of Langerhans cell
histiocytosis, chemotherapy in addition to local therapy (surgery with
or without radiation) is indicated. Long-­term follow-­up is necessary
whether the temporal bone lesion is a single isolated lesion or part of a
multisystem disease.
Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common malignancy of the
temporal bone in children. Symptoms and signs of rhabdomyosarcoma (see Chapter 549) originating in the middle ear or ear canal
include a mass or polyp in the middle ear or ear canal, bleeding
from the ear, otorrhea, otalgia, facial paralysis, and hearing loss.
Other cranial nerves also may be involved. Diagnosis is based on
biopsy, but the extent of disease is determined by both CT and MRI
of the temporal and facial bones, skull base, and brain (Fig. 684.1).

Management usually involves a combination of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.
Non-­Hodgkin lymphoma (see Chapter 545.2) and leukemia (see
Chapter 544) also occur rarely in the temporal bone. Although
primary neoplasms of the middle ear are very uncommon in children, they include adenoid cystic carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and
squamous cell carcinoma. Benign tumors of the temporal bone
include glomus tumors. The initial signs and symptoms of the more

common nasopharyngeal neoplasms (angiofibroma, rhabdomyosarcoma, epidermoid carcinoma) may be associated with insidious
onset of chronic otitis media with effusion (often unilateral). A high
index of suspicion is needed for diagnosing these tumors early.

The Skin
Chapter 685

Morphology of the Skin
Julie M. Dhossche and Yvonne E. Chiu
EPIDERMIS

The mature epidermis is a stratified epithelial tissue composed predominantly of keratinocytes (Fig. 685.1). The epidermis protects the
organism from the external environment through physical, chemical,
and immunologic barrier functions and prevents water loss. Epidermal
differentiation results in the formation of a functional barrier to the
external world. The epidermis comprises four histologically recognizable layers, described here from deepest to most superficial. The first or
basal layer consists of columnar cells that rest on the dermal-­epidermal
junction. Basal keratinocytes are connected to the dermal-­epidermal
junction by hemidesmosomes. Basal keratinocytes are attached to
themselves and to the cells in the spinous layer by desmosomal, tight,
gap, and adherens junctions. The role of the basal keratinocyte is to
serve as a continuing supply of keratinocytes for the normally differentiating epidermis and as a reservoir of cells to repair epidermal damage.
The second layer is the spinous layer, composed of three to four layers
of spinous cells. Their role is to synthesize keratin, which makes up the
keratin intermediate filament network. The third layer is the granular
layer, which consists of two to three layers of granular cells. Granular
cells contain keratohyalin and lamellar granules, containing the protein
and lipid components that make up the cornified layer. The fourth layer,
or cornified layer, is composed of multiple layers of dead, highly compacted cells. The dead cells are composed mainly of disulfide-­bonded
keratins cross-­linked by filaggrins. The intercellular spaces are composed of hydrophobic lipids, predominantly ceramides, cholesterol,
and fatty acids, serving as an effective barrier against water and salt loss
as well as permeation of water-­soluble substances. As the cornified layer

PART

XXIX
is replenished, the oldest or most superficial layer is shed in a highly
regulated process. The normal process of epidermal differentiation,
from basal cell to shedding of the cornified layer, takes 28 days.
The epidermis also contains three other cell types. The melanocytes
are pigment-­forming cells, which are responsible for skin color and protection from ultraviolet radiation. Epidermal melanocytes are derived
from the neural crest and migrate to the skin during embryonic life.
They reside in the interfollicular epidermis and in the hair follicles.
Melanocytes produce intracellular organelles (melanosomes) containing melanin, which they transfer via dendrites to the keratinocytes to
protect the keratinocyte nucleus from ultraviolet damage. Merkel cells
are type I slow-­adapting mechanosensory receptors for touch that differentiate within the epidermis from epidermal progenitor cells. Langerhans cells are dendritic cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system and
are uniquely characterized by a specific organelle, the Birbeck granule,
which resembles a tennis racket on electron microscopy. These cells are
derived from bone marrow and participate in immune reactions in the
skin, playing an active part in antigen presentation and processing.
The junction of the epidermis and dermis is the basement membrane
zone. This complex structure is a result of contributions from both
epidermal and mesenchymal cells. The dermal-­epidermal junction
extends from the basal cell plasma membrane to the uppermost region
of the dermis. Ultrastructurally, the basement membrane appears as a
trilaminar structure, consisting of a lamina lucida immediately adjacent to the basal cell plasma membrane, a central lamina densa, and the
subbasal lamina on the dermal side of the lamina densa. Several structures within this zone act to anchor the epidermis to the dermis. The
plasma membrane of basal cells contains electron-­dense plates known
as hemidesmosomes; tonofilaments course within basal cells to insert at
these sites. The hemidesmosomes are composed of 180-­and 230-­kDa
bullous pemphigoid antigens (BP180 [BPAG2, type XVII collagen]
and BP230 [BPAG1], respectively), α6β4 and α3β1 integrins, and plectin. Anchoring filaments originate in the plasma membrane, primarily
near the hemidesmosomes, and insert into the lamina densa. Anchoring fibrils, composed predominantly of type VII collagen, extend from
the lamina densa into the uppermost dermis, where they loop through
collagen fibrils before reinserting into the lamina densa.

4026 Part XXIX u The Skin
DERMIS

The dermis provides the skin with most of its mechanical properties
(see Fig. 685.1). The dermis forms a tough, pliable, fibrous supporting
structure between the epidermis and the subcutaneous fat. The predominant dermal cell is a spindle-­shaped fibroblast that is responsible
for the synthesis of collagen, elastic fibers, and mucopolysaccharides.
Phagocytic histiocytes, mast cells, and motile leukocytes are also present. Within the dermis are blood vessels, lymphatics, neural structures,
eccrine and apocrine sweat glands, hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and
smooth muscle. Morphologically, the dermis can be divided into two
layers: the superficial papillary layer that interdigitates with the rete
ridges of the epidermis and the deeper reticular layer that lies beneath
the papillary dermis. The papillary layer is less dense and more cellular,
whereas the reticular layer appears more compact because of the coarse
network of interlaced collagen and elastic fibers.
The extracellular matrix of the dermis consists of collagen and elastic fibers embedded in an amorphous ground substance. Collagen
provides strength and stability to the dermis, and elastic fibers allow
for elasticity. The gelatinous ground substance serves as a supporting
medium for the fibrillar and cellular components and as a storage place
for a substantial portion of body water.

SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE

The panniculus, or subcutaneous tissue, consists of fat cells and fibrous
septa that divide it into lobules and anchor it to the underlying fascia
and periosteum (see Fig. 685.1). Blood vessels and nerves are also present in this layer, which serves as a storage depot for lipid, an insulator to
conserve body heat, and a protective cushion against trauma.

APPENDAGEAL STRUCTURES

Appendageal structures are derived from aggregates of epidermal
cells that become specialized during early embryonic development.
Small buds (primary epithelial germs) appear in the third fetal month
and give rise to hair follicles, sebaceous and apocrine glands, and the
attachment bulges for the arrector pili muscles. Eccrine sweat glands
are derived from separate epidermal downgrowths that arise in the second fetal month and are completely formed by the fifth month. Formation of nails is initiated in the third intrauterine month.

Hair Follicles

The pilosebaceous unit includes the hair follicle, sebaceous gland, arrector
pili muscle, and, in areas such as the axillae, an apocrine gland. Hair follicles are distributed throughout the skin, except in the palms, soles, lips,
and glans penis. Individual follicles extend from the surface of the epidermis to the deep dermis (see Fig. 685.1). The hair follicle is divided into four
segments: the infundibulum, which extends from the skin surface to the
opening of the sebaceous duct; the isthmus, extending from the sebaceous
duct opening to the bulge; the lower follicle between the bulge and the hair
bulb; and the hair bulb. The bulge is at the insertion of the arrector pili
muscle and is a focus of epidermal stem cells. The bulb is where the matrix
cells and the dermal papilla are involved in formation and maintenance of
the hair. The growing hair consists of the hair shaft, made of dead keratinocytes, and its supporting inner and outer root sheaths.
Human hair growth is cyclic, with alternate periods of growth (anagen), transition (catagen), and rest (telogen). The length of the anagen
phase varies from months to years, whereas catagen and telogen last
approximately 3 weeks and 3 months, respectively. At birth, all hairs are
in the anagen phase. Subsequent generative activity lacks synchrony,
so an overall random pattern of growth and shedding prevails. At any
time, approximately 85% of hairs are in the anagen phase. Scalp hair
usually grows about 1 cm per month.
The types of hair are lanugo, vellus, and terminal hairs. Lanugo hair
is thin and short; this hair is shed in utero and is replaced by vellus
hair by 36-­40 weeks of gestation. Vellus hair is short, soft, frequently
unpigmented, and distributed over the body. Terminal hair is long and
coarse and is found on the scalp, beard, eyebrows, eyelashes, and axillary and pubic areas. During puberty, androgenic hormone stimulation causes pubic, axillary, and beard hair to change from vellus hair
to terminal hair.

Sebaceous Glands

Sebaceous glands occur in all areas except the palms, soles, and dorsal
feet and are most numerous on the head, upper chest, and back (see
Fig. 685.1). Their ducts open into the hair follicles except on the eyelids,
lips, nipples, prepuce, and labia minora, where they emerge directly
onto the skin surface. These holocrine glands are saccular structures
that are often branched and lobulated and consist of a proliferative
basal layer of small flat cells peripheral to the central mass of lipidized
cells. The latter cells disintegrate as they move toward the duct and
form the lipid secretion known as sebum, which consists of triglycerides, wax esters, squalene, and cholesterol esters. The purpose of sebum
production likely relates to hydrophobic skin barrier function. Sebaceous glands depend on hormonal stimulation and are activated by
androgens at puberty. Fetal sebaceous glands are stimulated by maternal androgens, and their lipid secretion, together with desquamated
stratum corneum cells, constitutes the vernix caseosa.

Apocrine Glands

The apocrine glands are located in the axillae, areolae, perianal and
genital areas, and periumbilical region (see Fig. 685.1). These large,
coiled, tubular structures continuously secrete an odorless milky fluid
that is discharged in response to adrenergic stimuli, usually because
of emotional stress. Bacterial biotransformation of apocrine sweat
components (fatty acids, thioalcohols, and steroids) accounts for the
unpleasant odor associated with perspiration. Apocrine glands remain
dormant until puberty, when they enlarge and secretion begins in
response to androgenic activity. The secretory coil of the gland consists
of a single layer of cells enclosed by a layer of contractile myoepithelial
cells. The duct is lined with a double layer of cuboidal cells and opens
into the pilosebaceous complex.

Eccrine Sweat Glands

Eccrine sweat glands are distributed over the entire body surface and
are most abundant on the palms and soles (see Fig. 685.1). Those on
the hairy skin respond to thermal stimuli and serve to regulate body
temperature by delivering water to the skin surface for evaporation;
in contrast, sweat glands on the palms and soles respond mainly to
psychophysiologic stimuli.
Each eccrine gland consists of a secretory coil located in the reticular dermis or subcutaneous fat and a secretory duct that opens onto the
skin surface. Sweat pores can be identified on the epidermal ridges of the
palm and fingers with a magnifying lens but are not readily visualized
elsewhere. Two types of cells constitute the single-­layered secretory coil:
small dark cells and large clear cells. These rest on a layer of contractile
myoepithelial cells and a basement membrane. The glands are supplied
by sympathetic nerve fibers, but the pharmacologic mediator of sweating
is acetylcholine rather than epinephrine. Sweat from these glands consists of water; sodium; potassium; calcium; chloride; phosphorus; lactate;
and small quantities of iron, glucose, and protein. The composition varies with the rate of sweating but is always hypotonic in normal children.

Nails

Nails are specialized protective epidermal structures that form convex, translucent, tight-­fitting plates on the distal dorsal surfaces of the
fingers and toes. The nail plate, which is derived from a metabolically
active matrix of multiplying cells situated beneath the posterior nail
fold, is composed of anucleate keratinocytes. Nail growth is relatively
slow; complete fingernail regrowth takes 6 months, and complete toenail regrowth requires 12-­18 months. The nail plate is bounded by the
lateral and posterior nail folds; a thin eponychium (the cuticle) protrudes from the posterior fold over a crescent-­shaped white area called
the lunula. The eponychium serves as a sealant barrier to protect the
germinal matrix of the nail plate. The hyponychium refers to the volar
surface epithelium of the distal digit and seals the nail bed distally. The
pink color beneath the nail reflects the underlying vascular bed. Nail
health relies on several factors, including nutrition, hydration, local
infection/irritation, and systemic disease.

Chapter 686

Dermatologic Evaluation
of the Patient
Julie M. Dhossche and Yvonne E. Chiu
HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

A history and careful physical examination are often necessary for
accurate assessment of skin disorders. A good skin exam is essential
in dermatologic evaluation and should be performed under adequate
illumination. In addition to the skin covering the entire body surface,
mucous membranes (conjunctiva, oropharynx, nasal mucosa, and anogenital mucosa), hair, and nails should be examined when appropriate.
The color, turgor, texture, temperature, and moisture of the skin and
the growth, texture, caliber, and luster of the hair and nails should be
noted. Erythema or other color changes may be challenging to appreciate in children with darker skin tones, and other features of the disorder should be relied upon to make the diagnosis. Skin lesions should
be palpated, inspected, and classified on the basis of morphology, size,
color, texture, firmness, configuration, location, and distribution. One
must also decide whether the changes are those of the primary lesion
itself or whether the clinical pattern has been altered by a secondary
factor such as infection, trauma, or therapy.
Primary lesions are classified as macules, papules, patches, plaques,
nodules, tumors, vesicles, bullae, pustules, wheals, and cysts. A macule represents an alteration in skin color but cannot be felt. When
the lesion is >1 cm, the term patch is used. Papules are palpable solid
lesions <1 cm. Plaques are palpable lesions >1 cm in size and have a flat
surface. Nodules are palpable lesions >1 cm with a rounded surface.
The word tumor may be used for a large nodule that is suspected to
be neoplastic in origin. Vesicles are raised, fluid-­filled lesions <1 cm in
diameter; when larger, they are called bullae. Pustules are fluid-­filled
lesions containing purulent material. Wheals are flat-­topped, palpable
lesions of variable size, duration, and configuration that represent dermal collections of edema fluid. Cysts are circumscribed, thick-­walled
lesions; they are covered by a normal epidermis and contain fluid or
semisolid material.
Primary lesions may change into secondary lesions, or secondary
lesions may develop over time where no primary lesion existed. Primary lesions are usually more helpful for diagnostic purposes than secondary lesions. Secondary lesions include scales, purpura, petechiae,
ulcers, erosions, excoriations, fissures, crusts, and scars. Scales consist
of compressed layers of stratum corneum cells that are retained on the
skin surface. Purpuras are the result of bleeding into the skin and have
a red-­purple color; they may be flat or palpable. Petechiae are small
(<2-­3 mm) purpura. Erosions involve focal loss of the epidermis, and
they heal without scarring. Ulcers extend into the dermis and tend to
heal with scarring. Ulcerated lesions inflicted by scratching are often
linear or angular in configuration and are called excoriations. Fissures
are caused by splitting or cracking. Crusts consist of matted, retained
accumulations of blood, serum, pus, and epithelial debris on the surface of a weeping lesion. Scars are end-­stage lesions that can be thin,
depressed, and atrophic; raised and hypertrophic; or flat and pliable.
Lichenification is a thickening of skin with accentuation of normal
skin lines that is caused by chronic irritation (rubbing, scratching) or
inflammation.
If the diagnosis is not clear after a thorough examination, one or
more diagnostic procedures may be indicated.

BIOPSY OF SKIN

Biopsy of skin is occasionally required for diagnosis. The two most
commonly used approaches are the shave biopsy and the punch biopsy.
A shave biopsy is primarily used for superficial, raised lesions, whereas

4027

a punch biopsy is used when it is indicated to sample the dermis and
subcutaneous tissue, as with most inflammatory dermatoses. Both are
simple, relatively painless procedures and usually provide adequate tissue for examination if the appropriate lesion is sampled. The selection
of a fresh, well-­developed primary lesion is extremely important to
obtain an accurate diagnosis. In cases of a punch biopsy, the site of the
biopsy should have relatively low risk for damage to underlying dermal
structures. After cleansing of the site, the skin is anesthetized by intradermal injection of 1–2% lidocaine, with or without epinephrine, with
a 27-­or 30-­gauge needle. For a shave biopsy, a double-­edged razor or
scalpel is used to remove a thin disk of tissue down to the upper dermis.
Hemostasis can be obtained with 20% aluminum chloride solution,
and the biopsy site is then covered with petroleum jelly and a bandage.
In the case of a punch biopsy, after anesthetizing the skin, a punch tool,
usually 3 or 4 mm in diameter, is pressed firmly against the skin and
rotated until it sinks to the proper depth. All three layers (epidermis,
dermis, and subcutis) should be contained in the plug. The plug should
be lifted gently with forceps or extracted with a needle and separated
from the underlying tissue with iris scissors. Bleeding abates with firm
pressure and with suturing. The biopsy specimen should be placed in
10% formaldehyde solution (Formalin) for appropriate processing.

WOOD LAMP

A Wood lamp emits ultraviolet light mainly at a wavelength of 365
nm. A skin examination under a Wood lamp, which is performed in a
darkened room, is useful in accentuating changes in pigmentation and
detecting fluorescence in certain infectious disorders. Discrete areas of
altered pigment can often be visualized more clearly by using a Wood
lamp, particularly if the pigmentary change is epidermal. Hyperpigmented lesions appear darker, and hypopigmented lesions (e.g., those
seen in tuberous sclerosis) lighter than the surrounding skin. Blue-­
green fluorescence is detectable at the base of each infected hair shaft
in ectothrix infections, such as tinea capitis caused by Microsporum
species. Scales and crusts may appear pale yellow, but this color is not
evidence of a fungal infection. Dermatophyte lesions of the skin (tinea
corporis) do not fluoresce; macules of tinea versicolor have a golden
fluorescence under a Wood lamp. Erythrasma, an intertriginous infection caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum, may fluoresce pink-­
orange, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa is yellow-­
green under a
Wood lamp.

POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE PREPARATION

Potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation is a rapid and reliable method
for detecting fungal elements of both yeasts and dermatophytes. Scaly
lesions should be scraped at the active border for optimal recovery of
mycelia and spores. Vesicles should be unroofed, and the blister roof
should be clipped and placed on a slide for examination. In tinea capitis, infected hairs must be plucked from the follicle; scales from the
scalp do not usually contain mycelia. A few drops of 20% KOH are
added to the specimen. Dimethyl sulfoxide is usually in solution with
the KOH, negating the need to heat the specimen. If using KOH without dimethyl sulfoxide, the specimen is gently heated over an alcohol
lamp or on a hot plate until the KOH begins to bubble. Alternatively,
sufficient time (10-­20 minutes) can be allowed for dissolution of the
keratin at room temperature. The preparation is examined under low-­
intensity light microscopy for fungal elements.

TZANCK SMEAR

Tzanck smear had been useful in the diagnosis of infections caused
by herpes simplex virus or varicella-­zoster virus and for the detection
of acantholytic cells in pemphigus. An intact, fresh vesicle is ruptured
and drained of fluid. The roof and base of the blister are then carefully
scraped with a No. 15 scalpel blade, with care taken to avoid drawing a significant amount of blood; the material is smeared on a clear
glass slide and air dried. Staining with Giemsa stain is preferable, but
Wright stain is acceptable. Balloon cells and multinucleated giant cells
are diagnostic of herpes virus infection; acantholytic epidermal cells—
large round epidermal cells with hypertrophic nuclei—are characteristic of pemphigus.

Direct fluorescent assay and polymerase chain reaction tests have

varicella-­zoster infections. Both of these are rapid, sensitive, and specific, with the polymerase chain reaction even more so. When obtaining specimens for these tests, the vesicles should be ruptured before
sample collection with the swab.

IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE STUDIES

Immunofluorescence studies of skin can be used to detect tissue-­fixed
antibodies to skin components and complement; characteristic staining patterns are specific for certain skin disorders (Table 686.1). Direct
immunofluorescence detects autoantibodies bound to cutaneous antigens in the skin, and indirect immunofluorescence detects circulating
autoantibodies present in the serum.
Skin biopsy specimens for direct immunofluorescence should be
obtained from involved sites except in those diseases for which perilesional skin or uninvolved skin is required. A punch biopsy sample
is obtained, and the tissue is placed in a special transport medium or
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for transport or storage. Thin
cryostat sections of the specimen are incubated with fluorescein-­
conjugated antibodies to the specific antigens.
Serum of patients can be examined by indirect immunofluorescence techniques using sections of normal human skin, guinea pig
lip, or monkey esophagus as substrate. The substrate is incubated with
fresh or thawed frozen serum and then with fluorescein-­conjugated
antihuman globulin. If the serum contains antibody to epithelial
components, its specific staining pattern can be seen on fluorescence
microscopy. By serial dilution, the titer of circulating antibody can
be estimated.

686.1 Cutaneous Manifestations of Systemic
Diseases
Julie M. Dhossche and Yvonne E. Chiu
Selected diseases have signature skin findings, often as the presenting
signs of illness, which can facilitate the assessment of patients with
complex medical states (Table 686.2).

CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASES
Lupus Erythematosus

Lupus erythematosus (LE; see Chapter 199) is an idiopathic autoimmune inflammatory disease that may be multisystemic (i.e., systemic
LE or SLE) or confined to the skin. Distinct cutaneous lupus subtypes
seen in children include acute cutaneous LE, subacute cutaneous LE,
chronic cutaneous LE (including discoid LE, discussed under “Discoid
Lupus Erythematosus”), and neonatal LE (discussed under “Neonatal
Lupus Erythematosus”).

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

SLE is a chronic inflammatory multisystem disease with approximately
15–20% of cases diagnosed in childhood. It is diagnosed when 4 of
11 well-­defined clinical and 6 immunologic criteria are present (see
Chapter 199), where both one clinical and one immunologic criterion
each must be met. Four of the clinical criteria are skin findings. Criterion 1 is acute cutaneous lupus, which may involve the classic malar or
“butterfly” rash (Fig. 686.1), bullous lupus lesions, psoriasiform and/
or annular polycyclic lupus lesions that resolve without scarring, and
photosensitive erythematous macular or papular eruption (Fig. 686.2).

The malar rash must be distinguished from other causes of a “red face,”
most notably seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and rosacea.
Criterion 2 is chronic cutaneous lupus, which includes discoid lupus
lesions, hypertrophic (verrucous) lupus lesions, and lupus panniculitis, among others. Criterion 3 is oral or nasal ulcers in the absence of
other causes such as vasculitis, Behçet disease, infection (herpes simplex virus [HSV]), or inflammatory bowel disease. Criterion 4 is nonscarring alopecia, which may include diffuse thinning or hair fragility
in the absence of other causes such as alopecia areata, drugs, or iron
deficiency. Patients may meet full SLE criteria based on skin findings
alone with one immunologic criterion (such as positive antinuclear
antibodies [ANA] or anti-­dsDNA). Other associated but not diagnostic
cutaneous findings include purpuric lesions, livedo reticularis, Raynaud phenomenon, and urticaria.
On histology, cutaneous LE demonstrates varying degrees of epidermal atrophy, plugging of hair follicles, and a vacuolar alteration at
an inflamed dermal-­epidermal junction. Deposition of immunoglobulins (IgM, IgG) and complement in lesional skin may help confirm the
diagnosis. Immune deposits in nonlesional sun-­exposed skin are found

in the majority of patients with SLE (lupus band test), although clinical
use of this test has been mostly abandoned in favor of serologic testing.
The skin lesions often respond to treatment of the SLE with systemic
agents. Oral hydroxychloroquine is used most commonly, but many
other systemic therapies are effective, including both classic and biologic immunosuppressants. Low-­to mid-­potency topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, and intralesional corticosteroid
injection may be considered for adjunctive therapy for skin lesions. A
multispecialty approach is recommended, as pediatric patients are at
significantly higher risk for long-­term morbidity than adults.

Neonatal Lupus Erythematosus

Neonatal LE (see Chapter 199.1) manifests at birth or during the first
few weeks of life as annular, erythematous, scaly plaques, typically
on the head, neck, and upper trunk (Fig. 686.3). Telangiectasias are
also common. Ultraviolet light may exacerbate or initiate cutaneous
lesions. Passive transplacental transfer of maternal anti-­Ro/SSA and
anti-­La/SSB antibodies causes the transient skin lesions, though most
infants are born to mothers without a known rheumatologic diagnosis.

Antibody levels wane by 6 months old, generally resulting in clearance
of the rash. Congenital heart block occurs in 30% of affected infants, but
only 10% of affected infants have both skin and cardiac abnormalities.
Noncardiac extracutaneous manifestations, such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, and cholestatic liver disease, are less common. Neonatal LE
is often misdiagnosed as infantile eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, or
tinea corporis. Skin lesions are typically managed conservatively, given
the transient nature of neonatal LE, and strict sun avoidance and protection are important. If necessary, low-­to mid-­potency topical corticosteroids may be used. Systemic agents should be avoided. Maternal
ANA testing is indicated.

Discoid Lupus Erythematosus

Discoid LE (DLE) is uncommon in early childhood and manifests in
late adolescence. The signature skin findings in DLE are chronic, erythematous, scaly, atrophic plaques (Fig. 686.4) on sun-­exposed skin
that frequently heal with scarring and dyspigmentation. Extracutaneous features may include involvement of the nasal and oral mucosa,
eyes, and nails. The differential diagnosis includes other photodermatoses, such as polymorphous light eruption, juvenile springtime eruption, and juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM). There is a distinct overlap
between SLE and DLE, with common histopathologic features and
photoexacerbation; most patients with DLE have normal laboratory
results and do not progress to systemic disease.
First-­line treatment of DLE consists of low-­to mid-­potency topical corticosteroids. Other topical options include calcineurin inhibitors and retinoids. Intralesional corticosteroid injection is also effective
for severe localized lesions. Oral hydroxychloroquine is used first-­line
for severe skin disease or as a second-­line agent when lesions are not

lichen planus, medication reactions, and infectious exanthems.
Pathology of lesional skin demonstrates epidermal atrophy and vacuolar degeneration at the dermal-­epidermal junction, often similar
to LE. JDM is distinct from adult dermatomyositis in both presentation and prognosis. Pediatric patients have more difficulty with
gastrointestinal (GI) vasculopathy and cutaneous calcifications, and
JDM is not a paraneoplastic phenomenon as in adults. A rare clinical
variant known as amyopathic dermatomyositis occurs when only
skin, and not muscle, is involved.
Skin lesions benefit from systemic immunosuppressive therapy, as
discussed in detail in Chapter 200. Adjunctive treatment options for
skin disease include topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors.
The cutaneous calcinosis of JDM is difficult to manage, with a variety
of agents showing limited benefit, and no treatment consensus exists.
Strict photoprotection and sunlight avoidance are vital to prevent cutaneous exacerbations.

Systemic Sclerosis

Systemic sclerosis is characterized by diffuse skin hardening and thickening, along with systemic features. It frequently manifests as acral
(sclerodactyly, ulceration, nail fold telangiectasia, or Raynaud phenomenon) and facial changes (pinched nose, furrowed perioral skin,
or “scleroderma facies”) (see Chapter 201). Overlap syndromes such as
mixed connective tissue disease may include some physical and laboratory features of scleroderma.

Morphea

Fig. 686.4 Erythematous scaly plaque of discoid lupus erythematosus.

Morphea, also called localized scleroderma (see Chapter 201), is another
autoimmune connective tissue disease characterized by skin hardening
and thickening. The lesions of morphea are generally more localized,
and it is a distinct disorder from systemic sclerosis. There are five subtypes of morphea, including circumscribed (plaque), linear, generalized, pansclerotic, and mixed. Though morphea is not characterized
by the degree of systemic involvement that systemic sclerosis has, it
can have extracutaneous manifestations. Neurologic findings such as
seizures, migraine headaches, focal neurologic deficits, and asymptomatic MRI abnormalities are seen in some patients, predominately those
with linear morphea of the head and neck. Musculoskeletal complications can include joint contractures, limb length and girth discrepancies, arthritis, and arthralgias, and these are most common in children
with linear morphea of a limb.

VASCULITIDES

minimally pruritic eruption occurs in photodistributed areas such
as the face, upper trunk, and extensor extremities. Circumscribed
periocular involvement of this heliotrope rash involving the eyelids
may take the appearance of “raccoon eyes,” particularly in young
children. Distinctive erythematous, scaly papules overlying the
knuckles and other joints (Gottron papules) are helpful in suggesting the diagnosis in the absence of associated muscle weakness
(Fig. 686.5). Other cutaneous features include nail fold and gingival
margin telangiectasia, palmar hyperkeratosis (“mechanic’s hands”),
ulceration resulting from vasculopathy or underlying calcinosis,
lipodystrophy, and a poikilodermatous (dyspigmentation and telangiectasia) eruption over the shoulder girdle (“shawl sign”). Cutaneous features may precede the systemic illness, which is primarily
characterized by muscle weakness and pain. The differential diagnosis includes atopic dermatitis, other connective tissue diseases,

The vasculitides (see Chapter 210) encompass a broad group of disorders having considerable overlap with connective tissue diseases.
Immune-­mediated inflammation of blood vessels of varying size may
be caused by an underlying inflammatory state, infection, medication,
or malignancy. Common clinical features include palpable nonthrombocytopenic purpuric skin lesions, arthritis, fever, myalgia, fatigue,
and weight loss as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
Extracutaneous organs that may be involved include the joints, lungs,
kidneys, and central nervous system.

Henoch-­Schönlein Purpura (Immunoglobulin A
Vasculitis)

Henoch-­Schönlein purpura (see Chapter 210.1) is a vasculitis that
manifests in school-­
age children as palpable purpuric lesions in
gravity-­
dependent areas, predominantly the buttocks and lower
extremities (Fig. 686.6). Infantile hemorrhagic edema (IHE; also
called acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy) shares some clinical features with Henoch-­
Schönlein purpura but appears in infants and
toddlers. IHE is characterized by the sudden onset of circumscribed
edema with purpuric papules and plaques on the trunk and extremities but, unlike Henoch-­Schönlein purpura, commonly affects the face
and lacks other organ involvement. Henoch-­Schönlein purpura must
also be differentiated from infectious causes of purpuric skin lesions,
such as meningococcemia, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and purpuric viral exanthems such as those caused by enteroviruses, as well as
from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and other vasculitides. Diagnosis is

confirmed by histologic confirmation of a small vessel vasculitis with
the immunofluorescence finding of IgA in blood vessel walls. Skin
lesions are generally managed conservatively and self-­resolve in 3–4
weeks. Systemic treatment is discussed in detail in Chapter 210.1.

Kawasaki Disease

Kawasaki disease (see Chapter 208) is a common vasculitis usually
seen in children younger than age 5 years. The skin eruption of Kawasaki disease is polymorphic, manifesting variously as maculopapular
or morbilliform eruptions, urticaria, targetoid lesions, or psoriasiform
lesions on the trunk and extremities. Early involvement with erythema
and peeling in the perineum/inguinal region may be an initial clue to
the diagnosis. Acral edema and desquamation are also prominent features but typically occur later. Classic mucocutaneous features include
erythematous cracked lips, nonpurulent conjunctivitis with sparing of
the limbus, and lingual plaques (“white strawberry tongue”) that shed
to produce denuded, erythematous patches with prominent papilla
(“strawberry tongue”). Extracutaneous features include high fever,
cervical lymphadenopathy, arthritis, and occasionally cardiac or GI
disease. First-­line treatment is with aspirin and intravenous immunoglobulin, as discussed in Chapter 208. Multisystem inflammatory
syndrome in children (MIS-­C) (Chapter 311) may resemble Kawasaki
disease; cutaneous manifestations are noted in Table 686.3.

Behçet Disease

Behçet disease (see Chapter 202) is a multisystem disease that includes
oral and genital ulceration and ocular disease (uveitis, relapsing iridocyclitis) in older children and adults. Recurrent aphthous stomatitis is
present in almost all patients and is commonly the presenting symptom. Genital ulcerations may resemble aphthae; can occur on the penis,
scrotum, or vulva; and may be particularly painful in females. Perianal
ulceration is more common in children than in adults. Additional skin
findings may include folliculitis, purpuric lesions, erythema nodosum,
and pustule formation after venipuncture or skin trauma (pathergy).
Differential diagnosis of oral lesions includes recurrent aphthous stomatitis, herpes simplex, and rare oculocutaneous syndromes (e.g.,
MAGIC [mouth and genital ulcers with inflamed cartilage] syndrome).
Skin biopsy demonstrates nongranulomatous vasculitis in all vessel
sizes. Oral lesions may respond to swish and spit/swallow preparations variably, including corticosteroids, antihistamines, antibiotics,
and analgesics. Skin lesions are managed with topical corticosteroids,
topical anesthetics such as sucralfate, and systemic agents as outlined
in Chapter 202.

GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASES
Inflammatory Bowel Disease

Inflammatory bowel disease includes ulcerative colitis (see Chapter
382.1) and Crohn disease (see Chapter 382.2). Skin lesions of inflammatory bowel disease are classified as specific or reactive. Specific cutaneous manifestations have the same histologic features and pathologic

4033

L, Bouaziz JD, Wallach D, et al. Neutrophilic dermatoses as systemic

mechanism as the underlying inflammatory bowel disease lesions and
include aphthous ulcers, granulomatous cheilitis, perianal fistulas and
fissures, and metastatic Crohn disease (discussed later). Reactive cutaneous manifestations occur secondary to immune-­mediated antigen
cross reactivity between gut and skin components; examples include
erythema nodosum and pyoderma gangrenosum.
Up to 30% of patients with ulcerative colitis present with cutaneous
manifestations. Aphthous ulcers are common and may worsen with
gastrointestinal exacerbations. Erythema nodosum, occurring in up to
10% of patients, manifests as warm, erythematous nodules, often on
the distal lower extremities. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a focal, ulcerative process that has distinctive, inflamed, undermined borders and a
purulent, boggy center. Thrombophlebitis also occurs at an increased
rate in patients with ulcerative colitis.
Crohn disease classically manifests as perianal fissures and skin tags,
abscesses, sinuses, and fistulas; these may be presenting signs. Enlargement of the lips and a cobblestone appearance of oral mucosa may also
be present, known as orofacial granulomatosis or cheilitis granulomatosa. As in ulcerative colitis, aphthae, erythema nodosum, and pyoderma gangrenosum occur with increased frequency and may improve
with treatment of the underlying disease. Noncaseating granulomatous
inflammation is seen on routine histopathology, and when found in skin
not contiguous with the intestinal tract, is labeled metastatic Crohn
disease. Metastatic lesions may appear as solitary or multiple localized
plaques or nodules and may be located on perianal, perioral, or other
cutaneous surfaces, including scars and ileostomy sites. In most cases
of inflammatory bowel disease–associated skin disease, treatment of
the underlying condition improves the cutaneous sequelae.
Rarely, these associated skin findings may be seen without the classic GI manifestations, warranting continued GI surveillance for subsequent disease development. Isolated cutaneous involvement is treated
similarly with systemic steroid-­sparing and biologic agents with or
without topical or intralesional corticosteroids. Azathioprine, a common treatment, causes increased risk for nonmelanoma skin cancers.

CUTANEOUS MANIFESTATIONS OF MALIGNANCY

Skin disease associated with malignancy has a wide variety of presentations, including both metastatic lesions and nonmalignant paraneoplastic conditions. Cutaneous metastases manifest as firm nodules and
occur at any cutaneous site. Paraneoplastic reaction patterns are often
distinctive and can aid in the diagnosis of the underlying malignancy.
Some genetic syndromes have an increased malignancy risk that may
be suggested initially by cutaneous signs. Other cutaneous findings
that may signal an underlying malignancy include pruritus, ichthyosis,
acanthosis nigricans, urticaria, pemphigus, and erythroderma.

Sweet Syndrome

Also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, Sweet syndrome
(see Chapter 213) occurs in several forms, including classical (usually
idiopathic or infection-­
related, Fig. 686.7), malignancy-­associated,

4034 Part XXIX u The Skin
immunodeficiency-­
related, autoinflammatory (recurrent fever) syndromes, and drug-­induced. Pathogenesis for all four forms remains
unclear; however, new data are emerging implicating a potential interleukin (IL)-­
1–mediated pathway. Malignancy-­
associated Sweet syndrome is most commonly associated with hematologic malignancies,
especially acute myelogenous leukemia. It manifests abruptly before,
during, or after the malignancy course and is characterized by tender,
erythematous, edematous plaques or nodules that may be pustular or
targetoid, often accompanied by fever, anemia, and leukocytosis. Oral
ulcers are more common in malignancy-­associated Sweet syndrome
than in other forms of the disease, and extracutaneous manifestations
involving various organ systems may also occur. Diagnosis is confirmed
by the presence of a dense neutrophilic infiltrate without evidence of
vasculitis. The differential diagnosis includes other neutrophilic dermatoses such as pyoderma gangrenosum as well as cellulitis, erythema multiforme, Behçet disease, and erythema nodosum. First-­line treatment for
both malignancy-­associated and nonmalignancy-­associated Sweet syndrome is oral glucocorticoids (prednisone 1-­2 mg/kg/day for 2-­4 weeks)
in combination with high-­potency topical or intralesional corticosteroids. Systemic steroid-­sparing agents include colchicine and dapsone.
Cutaneous manifestations of other autoinflammatory diseases are
noted in Table 686.4.

Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH, see Chapter 556.1) is a neoplastic
disorder characterized by proliferation of myeloid dendritic cells. Once
thought to be Langerhans cells, which are skin-­resident dendritic cells,
the cells of LCH are now understood to represent a distinct cell type.
LCH can be a single-­system or multisystem disease, with the neoplastic
infiltrate in organs such as the skin, bone, central nervous system, lung,
hematopoietic system, liver, and spleen. When present on the skin,
the lesions of LCH can be crusted erosions, scaly papules, or purpura.
There is a predilection for the scalp, palms, soles, and intertriginous
areas such as axillae and groin. Prognosis and treatment are variable
depending on the organ systems involved.

Necrolytic Migratory Erythema (Glucagonoma
Syndrome)

Necrolytic migratory erythema is a distinctive migratory erythema
that often signals an underlying neoplasm, usually an α-­cell pancreatic tumor. Polycyclic, weeping, erythematous patches and plaques on
the face, extremities, and groin occur in association with glossitis and
cheilitis. The lesions are painful or pruritic, enlarge and coalesce over
time, and may develop central clearing with vesicles, crusts, and scales
peripherally. Skin biopsy reveals superficial necrolysis with perivascular
infiltrate. Elevated glucagon levels, hyperglycemia, and hypoaminoacidemia confirm the diagnosis, and tumor resection leads to resolution of
the rash. Other treatments for necrolytic migratory erythema include
somatostatin analogs (octreotide) and nutritional support; however,
these measures do not affect the underlying tumor burden.

ERYTHROMELALGIA

This disorder may be primary (caused by pathogenic genetic variants
in SCN9A) or secondary (myeloproliferative disorders, paraneoplastic,
autoimmune) and is characterized by the triad of recurrent extremity
pain, warmth, and redness. Warmth, exercise, sitting, or wearing shoes
or gloves may initiate the episode. Cooling and elevation may relieve
symptoms (see Chapter 211.5).

CUTANEOUS REACTIONS IN THE SETTING OF
IMMUNOSUPPRESSION

Medication reactions, infectious etiologies, and graft-­
versus-­
host
disease (GVHD) are included in the differential diagnosis in skin
eruptions in immunosuppressed patients; cutaneous and histologic
similarities can be confounding.

Medication Reactions

The majority of medication reactions are mild morbilliform or exanthematous eruptions of little clinical consequence. Identifying the

Fig. 686.8 Lichenoid eruption in chronic graft-­versus-­host disease.
suspect medication may be difficult owing to the many medications
used in immunosuppressed patients. Features that may help identify
suspect medications include rash onset relative to exposure, character
of distribution and spread, associated symptoms, and laboratory data.
Medication eruptions usually begin on the trunk 7-­10 days after exposure; they spread peripherally and are associated with pruritus and, less
commonly, with fever, arthralgia, and lymphadenopathy. Eosinophilia
may support a diagnosis of drug eruption but may be absent in the setting of bone marrow suppression. Penicillins, sulfa drugs, cephalosporins, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), anticonvulsants,
and aminoglycosides are common offenders. Medication eruptions
may resolve despite continued use of the offending agent, or they may
progress to more severe involvement. A careful drug history, elimination of all nonessential, suspect medications or change to medications
of dissimilar class, and treatment of pruritus with emollients, topical
steroids, antihistamines, and antipruritics are indicated. Skin biopsies
are rarely useful in distinguishing medication eruptions from viral
exanthems, although GVHD, if sufficiently advanced, may have signature histopathologic findings.

Graft-­Versus-­Host Disease

GVHD (see Chapter 179) may have florid cutaneous expression
in addition to characteristic extracutaneous features such as fever,
mucositis, diarrhea, and hepatitis. It may be either acute or chronic.
Acute GVHD occurs in 20–70% of hematopoietic stem cell transplants, depending on histocompatibility differences. It may be mistaken for a medication reaction or infectious exanthem because of
the nonspecific erythematous maculopapular (morbilliform) eruption that often starts focally and then generalizes. Features that suggest acute GVHD include timing of eruption (typically 1-­3 weeks
after transplantation, at the time of hematopoietic reconstitution);
initial involvement of the head and neck including the ears; and subsequent spread to the trunk, extremities, palms, and soles. In severe
cases of acute GVHD, blistering, necrolysis, and erythroderma
occur. Chronic GVHD occurs in approximately 65% of long-­term
transplant survivors, who may or may not have experienced prior
acute GVHD. Cutaneous manifestations of chronic GVHD are distinctive, with sclerotic, poikilodermic scaly plaques and lichen planus–like papules predominating on the trunk and distal extremities
(Fig. 686.8). Sclerotic areas are prone to contracture and chronic
wound development. Involvement of the hair, nails, and oral mucosa
is also common in chronic GVHD. First-­line treatment for GVHD
includes systemic glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressants
supplemented by mid-­to high-­potency topical corticosteroids. In
mild disease, topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors
alone may be effective. Second-­line treatment approaches include
phototherapy (narrow-­band UVB or UVA1) and extracorporeal photopheresis. All patients with GVHD benefit from sunlight protection,
emollient use, and topical or oral antipruritics.

Julie M. Dhossche and Yvonne E. Chiu
See also Chapter 193.
Most cutaneous reactions that result from the use of systemic medications are confined to the skin and resolve without sequelae after discontinuation of the offending agent (Table 686.5). More severe drug
eruptions may be life-­
threatening, making rapid recognition vital
(Table 686.6 and see Chapter 695). Genetics and, particularly, ethnicity
appear to play a major role in determination of the occurrence of multisystem medication reactions, particularly to anticonvulsants.

DRUG RASH WITH EOSINOPHILIA AND SYSTEMIC
SYMPTOMS

Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome) is also called drug hypersensitivity syndrome or anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome. It is classically seen 2-­6 weeks after
initial exposure to an anticonvulsant (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, lamotrigine) or other drugs (allopurinol, minocycline, sulfonamides [dapsone, sulfasalazine], other antibiotics)
and often manifests as the triad of fever, rash, and hepatitis (Fig.

and arms. A diffuse exanthem of pruritic, morbilliform papules

hypersensitivity syndrome/drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic
symptoms. CMV, Cytomegalovirus; EBV, Epstein-­Barr virus; HHV, human herpesvirus. (From Kano Y, Ishida T, Hirahara K, Shiohara T. Visceral

are most common, though any morphology may be present (Fig.
686.10). Exfoliation early in the course, as seen in toxic epidermal necrolysis, is uncommon. If mucous membrane involvement
occurs, it is usually mild. Prominent periocular or facial edema,
cervical lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, and malaise accompany
this dramatic cutaneous eruption. Eosinophilia (≥500/μL) and
atypical lymphocytosis are common but not always present. Hepatitis
ranging from mild elevation of liver transaminase values to frank
hepatic failure may also be accompanied by interstitial nephritis,
pneumonitis, myocarditis, shock, and encephalitis; mortality rate
from these complications approaches 10%. Late-­onset thyroiditis
and hypothyroidism may occur months later as a result of antimicrosomal antibodies directed against thyroid peroxidases involved
in drug metabolism.
DRESS syndrome is caused by a T-­cell response specific to the
drug. Reactivation of herpesviruses, especially human herpesvirus
6, also contributes to DRESS syndrome via an unknown pathogenic mechanism. Genetic predisposition with particular HLA
allele types has also been implicated with specific ethnic groups
and drugs, such as HLA-­A*3101 with carbamazepine. The differential diagnosis includes Stevens-­Johnson syndrome, viral exanthem,
macrophage activation, hemophagocytic syndromes, and GVHD
in the appropriate clinical setting. DRESS syndrome is often distinguished from other medication reactions by its later onset after
drug exposure and more persistent course.
Withdrawal of the medication is the primary therapeutic intervention. Lymphocyte transformation tests and patch testing may be

Fig. 686.11 Serum sickness–like reaction is composed of urticarial
plaques with an erythematous border and violaceous centers.

Fig. 686.10 A 9-­yr-­old with cerebral palsy and seizures treated with
carbamazepine. Seventeen days after start of therapy he demonstrated
fever, rash (exanthematous), lymphadenopathy, and nephritis, all part
of a drug-­
induced hypersensitivity syndrome. (From Schachner LA,
Hansen RC, eds. Pediatric Dermatology, 3rd ed. Philadelphia: Mosby;
2003: p. 1269.)

helpful for identifying the offending drug when multiple suspect
agents are present, but drug discontinuation should not be delayed
while awaiting results. Symptomatic treatment of pruritus and pain
can be accomplished with emollients and mid-­to high-­potency topical corticosteroids (twice daily for 1-­2 weeks). Systemic corticosteroid therapy is necessary in the setting of rapidly evolving or severe
hepatic or renal involvement. Counseling about increased risk with
similar medications and in family members is important. DRESS
syndrome can have a relapsing course, both in the skin and other
organ systems, well after the medication has been withdrawn and initial improvement achieved, necessitating close follow-­up for several
months.

circumscribed, erythematous

wheals occurred in this girl as a reaction to administration of cefixime.
Note the edematous center and halo of erythema. Circling a lesion
and noting whether it is clear 24 hours later facilitates diagnosis. (From
Paller AS, Mancini AJ, eds. Hurwitz Clinical Pediatric Dermatology, 5th
ed. Philadelphia: Elsevier; 2016: Fig. 20-­2, p. 469.)

SERUM SICKNESS–LIKE REACTION

Serum sickness–like reaction (SSLR) manifests as annular, urticarial, sharply marginated, coalescing plaques, often with a lavender
hue to the center (Fig. 686.11). In addition, acral erythema/edema,
arthritis/arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, and fever are often present.
Unlike with true serum sickness (see Chapter 191), laboratory evidence of circulating immune complexes and multisystem involvement of vasculitis are typically absent. The differential diagnosis
includes Kawasaki disease, connective tissue diseases, acute annular
urticaria, and DRESS syndrome. SSLR is most commonly seen 10-­
14 days after exposure to various drugs (especially cephalosporins,
penicillins, minocycline, and other antibiotics), as well as after certain infections and vaccinations. The cause of drug-­related SSLR is
unknown, but a toxic metabolite is suspected. In contrast to DRESS
syndrome, SSLR typically occurs after repeated drug exposures.

Medication withdrawal and symptomatic treatment with oral
antihistamines and analgesics are recommended. Systemic glucocorticoids are indicated for severe joint involvement or extensive
rashes.
