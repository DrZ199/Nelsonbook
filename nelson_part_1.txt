In Memory
DR. RICHARD BEHRMAN successfully served as editor of the Nelson
Textbook of Pediatrics for 9 editions spanning over 3 decades. But more
than that and without question, he excelled as an educator, a mentor, an
exemplary leader in the field of pediatrics, and a role model as an investigator, clinician, department chair, dean, and director of the Packard
Foundation Center for the Future of Children. Dick’s career exemplifies
the responsibility and critical role academic physicians must provide as
child advocates by combining scholarly pursuits to advance knowledge,
while seeking justice and equality for all children.
Dick always searched for expert contributors to the textbook who
believed in the value of caring for all children; he recruited leading authors
knowing that their approach to clinical pediatrics and to social justice
would have a deeper impact and broader reach by contributing to the
textbook. Because of this, Nelson’s persists as an up-­to-­date authoritative
global resource in not only presenting the clinical diagnosis and treatment
of childhood diseases but also in identifying issues of social justice and
providing solutions to improve access to health care and health outcomes.
Dick’s approachable intellect and intuitive nature fostered countless students, residents, and faculty allowing them to discover and nurture the best
version of themselves as physicians and human beings.
Although Dick is no longer with us, his legacy persists in his selection of chapter topics and his meticulous editing of the previous chapters along with his unyielding philosophy that Nelson must continue to
evolve while remaining a book for all children for generations to come.
For those of us who know Dick as “REB” we will miss you but never
forget you.

Preface
Whoever saves one life, it is considered as if they saved an entire world.
— Babylonian Talmud
The 22nd edition of Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics continues its tradition as an essential resource for general pediatric providers as well as
pediatric subspecialists as they rely on the most current and modern
approaches to diagnose and treat infants, children, and adolescents
throughout the world. The 22nd edition has been thoroughly revised
and updated by expert contributors and experienced editors to help
the reader keep up with the huge advances in clinical care derived from
basic, clinical, and population-­based research. The promise that translational medicine will improve the lives of children has become a daily
reality for most but not all children. Knowledge of human development, behavior, and diseases from the molecular to sociologic levels
has led to greater understanding of health and illness in children and to
substantial improvements in health quality for those who have access
to health care. These exciting scientific advances also provide hope to
effectively address prevention and treatment of new and emerging diseases threatening children and their families.
The field of pediatrics encompasses advocacy for all children
throughout the world and must address societal inequalities of important resources required for normal development, as well as protection
from natural and man-­
made disasters. Unfortunately, many children throughout the world have not benefited from the significant
advances in the prevention and treatment of health-­related problems.
For medical advances to benefit all children and youth, good clinical
practice must always be coupled with effective advocacy to overcome
unconscious and systemic biases, lack of political will, and misplaced
priorities.
This new edition of Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics attempts to provide the essential information that primary care and medical specialists, house staff, medical students, and all other care providers involved
in pediatric health care throughout the world need to understand to
effectively address the enormous range of biologic, psychologic, and
social problems that our children and youth face. Pediatric subspecialists will benefit from the details of coexisting disorders often seen in
their patients. Our goal is to be comprehensive yet concise and reader
friendly, embracing both new advances in clinical science and the
time-­honored art of pediatric practice.
The 22nd edition is reorganized and revised from the previous edition. There are many additional chapters of new diseases, as well as
substantial expansion or significant modification of others. In addition,
many more tables, photographs, imaging studies, and illustrative figures, as well as up-­to-­date references, have been added.
This new edition has greatly benefited from the addition of two new
associate editors with an extremely broad base of clinical experience:
Dr. Cara Mack, Professor of Pediatrics, Gastroenterology Division

Chief at the Medical College of Wisconsin, and Dr. Abigail Schuh,
Associate Professor of Pediatrics, Director of Education, Section of
Pediatric Emergency Medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin.
Although, to an ill child and their family and health care provider,
even the rarest disorder is of central importance, all health problems
cannot possibly be covered with the same degree of detail in one general textbook of pediatrics. Thus, leading articles and subspecialty texts
are referenced and should be consulted when more information is
desired. In addition, as new recommendations or policies are developed, they will be updated on our website.
The outstanding value of the 22nd edition of the textbook is due to
its many expert and authoritative contributors. We are all indebted to
these dedicated authors for their hard work, knowledge, thoughtfulness, and outstanding judgment.
Our sincere appreciation also goes to Jennifer Shreiner, John Casey,
and Sarah Barth at Elsevier and to Carolyn Redman in the Pediatric
Department of the Medical College of Wisconsin. Ms. Shreiner and
Ms. Redman have worked harmoniously together on five editions and
are actually the editors behind the editors in maintaining the book’s
excellence. We also wish to thank Ms. Hayley Severson, the Clinical
Services Librarian at Children’s Wisconsin who has been an outstanding asset in keeping the content as well as the references as current as
possible. We have all worked together to produce an edition that will be
helpful to those who provide care for children and youth and to those
desiring to know more about children’s health worldwide.
In this edition we have had informal assistance from many faculty
and house staff of the department of pediatrics at the Medical College
of Wisconsin, the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of
Pennsylvania, Harvard Medical School, and the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. The help of these individuals and
of the many practicing pediatricians from around the world who have
taken the time to offer thoughtful feedback and suggestions is always
greatly appreciated and helpful.
Last and certainly not least, we especially wish to thank our families
for their patience and understanding about the great time commitment
we as editors have spent reading and editing this edition.

The Field of Pediatrics
Chapter 1

Overview of Pediatrics
Lee M. Pachter and Nia J. Heard-­Garris
Since the late 19th century, pediatrics has been the only discipline dedicated to all aspects of the care and well-­being of infants, children, and
adolescents, including their health—their physical, mental, social, and
psychologic growth and development—and their ability to achieve full
potential as adults. The importance of scientific inquiry and research
discovery in pediatrics and related subspecialties was cemented by the
creation of the National Institute for Child Health and Development
(NICHD) in 1962. As the earliest pediatricians focused on social and
environmental issues that affected health (e.g., housing, sanitation,
and poverty), so too are today’s pediatricians (e.g., racism, poverty,
and other socioenvironmental influences). In 1959 the United Nations
(UN) issued the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, articulating
the universal presumption that children have fundamental needs and
rights. However, the United States is the only UN member that has not
yet ratified these rights.
The pediatrician’s purpose is to advance the well-­being of children,
and thus pediatricians must be concerned with specific organ systems,
genetics, and biologic processes and also with environmental, psychosocial, cultural, and political influences, all of which affect the health
and well-­being of children and their families. Pediatricians must be
advocates for the individual child, their families, and communities
because children cannot advocate wholly for themselves. Pediatricians
must serve as advocates of all children irrespective of culture, religion,
gender/gender identity, sexual orientation, race or ethnicity, ability,
place of birth, or geographic boundaries. The more politically, economically, or socially disenfranchised a population is, the greater the need
for advocacy for its children and for those who support children. Youth
are often the most vulnerable persons in society, and thus their needs
require special attention. As boundaries between nations blur through
advances in media, transportation, technology, communication, and
economics, a global, rather than a national or local, perspective for the
field of pediatrics becomes both a reality and a necessity.
The interconnectedness of health issues across the world has
achieved widespread recognition in the wake of new and emerging illnesses, such as COVID-­19, Zika, Ebola, and severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS), as well as familiar and persistent illnesses, such
as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and vaccine-­preventable illness.
Additionally, health issues transcend communicable disease and are
influenced by global events, such as war, ethnic wars, mass shootings,
bioterrorism, the burning of the Amazon rainforest, and the growing
severity of wildfires, storms, drought, and hurricanes brought about by
climate change to very specific events, such as the earthquake in Haiti
in 2010; the displacement of families during the Syrian refugee crisis in
2016–2018; the White supremacist attack on a mosque in Christchurch,
New Zealand, livestreamed in 2019; and George Floyd’s and Breonna
Taylor’s murders in 2020.

VITAL STATISTICS ABOUT CHILDREN’S HEALTH
GLOBALLY

From 1990 to 2020, the world population grew at an annual rate of 1%
per year, down from 1.3% during the prior 20 years, to reach a population of nearly 8 billion people. The population growth rate continues to
decline. The Pew Research Center projects the population to reach 10.9
billion people in 2100 with a growth rate of less than 0.1% at that time

because of the fall in fertility rates. Africa is the only continental region
that is predicted to continue to have strong population growth, as the 20
countries with the highest birthrates currently are all located in Africa.
By 2100, the countries of India, China, and Nigeria are estimated to be
the largest. In 2019, the average birthrate in the world was 17.9 births
per 1,000 population, with a range from 46/1,000 in Niger to 6.0/1,000
in Monaco. The most populous countries—China (18.5% of the world
population), India (17.7%), and the United States (4.3%)—have birthrates of 11, 18, and 11 per 1,000 population, respectively, which were
all trending down from previous years. Worldwide, there are roughly
2.5 billion youth under 19 years old, which accounts for approximately
one third (32%) of the world’s population. The African region boasts
the largest share of youth under 15 at 40% compared with 26% globally.
Despite global interconnectedness, the health of children and youth
varies widely between and within regions and nations, depending on
several interrelated factors. These include (1) economic conditions, (2)
educational, social, and cultural considerations, (3) health and social
welfare infrastructure, (4) climate and geography, (5) agricultural
resources and practices, which account for nutritional resources, (6)
stage of industrialization and urbanization, (7) gene frequencies for
certain disorders, (8) the ecology of infectious agents and their hosts,
(9) social stability, and (10) political focus and stability. Although
genetics, biology, and access to affordable and quality healthcare are
important determinants, social and structural influences on health
outcomes—the physical environment, political and economic conditions, and social, cultural, and behavioral considerations—play as great
a role, if not greater.
To ensure that the needs of children and adults worldwide were not
obscured by local needs, in 2000 the international community established eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) slated to be
achieved by 2015. Although all eight MDGs affect child well-­being,
MDG 4 was exclusively focused on children: to reduce the under-­5
mortality rate (U5MR) by two thirds between 1990 and 2015. It was
estimated that poor nutrition contributed to more than one third of
the deaths worldwide in children <5 years old, so many of the efforts to
reach this goal centered on increasing household food security. There
has been significant progress toward this goal; the worldwide U5MR
decreased by 60% between 1990 and 2021, from 93 deaths per 1,000
live births in 1990 to 38 in 2021. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) cites that between 5.2 and 5.4 million children died
worldwide from preventable or treatable causes. Infants younger than
28 days account for over half the deaths, followed by children age
1-­11 months, and then by children age 1-­4 years old. Children in sub-­
Saharan Africa are 9 times more likely to die before age 5 than children
in the developed areas of the world (see Fig. 3.1). School children (ages
5-­9 years old) also experienced a large decline in mortality since the
year 1990 related to lower prevalence of infectious diseases.
The infant mortality rate globally (2023) is 27.4 deaths per 1,000
live births, with female infants having a lower rate than male infants.
The child death rates in the first year of life were highest in Afghanistan (106.8), Somalia (88.0), and Central African Republic (84.2) per
1,000 live births. In the least developed countries, as classified by the
UN, this rate was 45 per 1,000, and the rate was 4 per 1,000 for high-­
income countries. The causes of infant and under-­5 mortality differ
greatly between developed and developing nations. The leading causes
of under-­5 mortality are preterm birth and birth-­related asphyxia/
trauma, pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria (Fig. 1.1). As compared
with higher-­resourced countries, more children less than 5 years old
in lower-­resourced countries die from non–birth-­related causes (see
Fig. 3.4).
In developing countries, over half of the deaths in children less than
5 years old resulted from infectious and parasitic diseases, including
diarrheal disease (10% of deaths) and pneumonia (15%). Neonatal

causes contributed 12%, congenital defects 9%, and malaria, AIDS, and
measles accounted for the other causes of death. In the United States,
pneumonia and influenza accounted for only 2% of under-­5 deaths,
with only negligible contributions from diarrheal diseases and malaria
(Table 1.1). Although unintentional injuries in developing countries
are a proportionately less important cause of mortality than in developed countries, the absolute rates and contributions of these injuries to
morbidity are substantially greater. In the United States, the top causes
of unintentional injury include unintentional suffocation, drowning,
motor vehicle collision, and fire. Other causes accounted for <5% of
total mortality within this age-­group (Tables 1.2). Violence is a significant contributor to injury-­related mortality in all child age-­groups
(Tables 1.2 and 1.3). Globally (2023), the life expectancy at birth is 73.2
years old, with females at 76 years and males at 70.8 years.

THE CHANGING PEDIATRIC WORLD

A profound improvement in child health within industrialized nations
occurred in the 20th century with the introduction of vaccines, antibiotic agents, improved hygienic practices, and attention to scientific
clinical practice. Efforts to control infectious diseases were complemented by better understanding of the role of nutrition in preventing illness and maintaining health. In the United States, Canada, and
parts of Europe, new and continuing discoveries in these areas led to
establishment of publicly funded well-­child clinics for low-­income
families. Although the timing of infectious disease control was uneven
around the globe, this focus on control was accompanied by significant
decreases in morbidity and mortality in all countries.
Later in the 20th century, with improved control of infectious diseases
through more effective prevention and treatment (including the eradication of polio in the Western hemisphere), pediatric medicine in industrialized nations increasingly turned its attention to a broad spectrum of

noninfectious acute and chronic conditions. These included potentially
lethal conditions in addition to temporarily or permanently disabling
conditions. Advances occurred in the diagnosis, care, and treatment of
leukemia and other neoplasms, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, diseases
of the newborn infant, congenital heart disease, genetic defects, rheumatic diseases, renal diseases, and metabolic and endocrine disorders.
Until the 1970s and early 1980s, children affected with sickle cell
disease often died within the first 3 years of life, often from overwhelming sepsis caused by encapsulated bacteria. In the 1980s a multicenter
study showed that early initiation of penicillin prophylaxis led to an
84% risk reduction for pneumococcal sepsis. Life expectancy for those
with sickle cell disease increased when penicillin prophylaxis was initiated early in life. The use of prophylactic penicillin became the standard of care, increasing the importance of early detection of sickle cell
disease (which led to expanding universal newborn screening) and
paving the way for advances in the chronic management of the disease,
including transfusion therapy, radiographic screening for silent cerebral infarctions, hydroxyurea as a disease-­modifying therapy, and now,
gene-­altering therapies. The success of penicillin prophylaxis likely led
to a more rapid rate of innovation in the diagnosis and management of
the disease as a result of increased life expectancy. Today 95% of individuals born with sickle cell disease will live to their 18th birthday, and
most will survive until their fifth decade.
Similarly, the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL),
the most common pediatric malignancy, has also shown amazing

advances. Five-­year survival rates have increased from <10% in the
1960s to >90% in 2023. Cystic fibrosis has shown improvements in
survival as well. In the 1960s, most children with cystic fibrosis did
not live to school age. With advances in pulmonary and nutritional
therapies, as well as earlier initiation of these therapies secondary
to earlier identification through newborn screening, a child born
with cystic fibrosis in 2010 has a projected life expectancy of 39-­56
years.
These major advances in the management of chronic diseases
of childhood were accomplished when significant improvement
occurred in the prevention and treatment of acute infectious diseases,
at least in industrial countries. This allowed human and economic
resources to shift toward addressing chronic disease. However, infectious diseases continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality
throughout the world. In the fall of 2021, the WHO recommended
the use of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine for children in areas of
moderate and high levels of transmission of Plasmodium falciparum,
which is the most prevalent cause of malaria in Africa. This historic
declaration holds great promise for improving children’s health, as
more than 250,000 African children under 5 die from malaria each
year. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-­
19) pandemic has
proved to be an unremitting global health challenge that has not only
affected health but also changed and influenced the socioeconomic
lives of people throughout the world.

THE NEW NORMAL: PANDEMICS

Since COVID-­19 was first reported and identified in Wuhan, China, in
2019, it has radically and fundamentally affected both the public health
and global health landscapes (see Chapters 311 and 449.1). The identification of COVID-­19 and development of a vaccine unfolded over the course
of 1 year, which was a testament to the importance and critical need for
scientific research and rapid clinical implementation. We learned that
children could present with or without symptoms and were important
factors in community-­based viral transmission.
Whereas many children experienced minor illnesses, others experienced more severe illnesses, which were related to underlying
chronic conditions, such as asthma or the use of medical devices for
children with special healthcare needs, and around 1% of children
would go on to develop multiinflammatory syndrome (MIS-­C). This
condition could be lethal, but most children who received timely care
improved. As of spring 2023, there were over 766 million cases and
nearly 6.9 million deaths from COVID-­19, and the United States had
the highest number of cases and deaths throughout the world. Children in the United States accounted for 6 million COVID-­19–positive cases, with 0.1–2.0% of children hospitalized and 0.03% leading
to child deaths.
Although children were less affected by COVID-­19–related illnesses
than their adult counterparts, they experienced significant mental
health and psychosocial challenges, grief, and loss. Over 1.5 billion

Part I u The Field of Pediatrics

children living through the pandemic faced unprecedented learning
challenges because of widespread school closures and dependence on
electronic devices and stable internet connections and widening educational disparities, especially for those in poverty, children of frontline
workers and single parents, and those already marginalized. Additionally, children who received nutritional support in school or received
in-­school or in-­home services to support their learning and/or developmental needs (e.g., speech therapy, specialized teaching, or other
ancillary therapies) also faced disruptions. These disruptions and stress
contributed to an increase in mental and emotional health burdens,
such as depression, anxiety, isolation, and fear; however, these burdens
were unable to be matched with a sufficient number of mental healthcare professionals to provide needed care.
The pandemic also disproportionately affected poor families and families of color in other ways. Children in these families faced increased
risk of economic hardship and instability, loss of caregivers, and other
challenges. Additionally, concerns about all children’s safety and welfare
continued and were highlighted, as noncustodial adults had less access
and exposure to children who may have experienced physical, sexual, or
emotional abuse. Finally, children with special healthcare needs experienced insurmountable challenges throughout the pandemic, such
as not receiving essential medicines, medical supplies, and nursing or
home healthcare services because of supply chain disruptions and staffing shortages. So although children largely were spared from the illness
severity, there were undoubtedly victims of the sequelae that the pandemic brought forth. Now, in partnership with parents, communities,
schools, and governments, pediatricians will need to continue to advocate for and support children to mitigate COVID-­19’s effects on children.

THE NEW MORBIDITIES

Given the advances in public health in decreasing morbidity and mortality in infectious diseases (immunization, hygiene, antibiotics), along
with technologic advances in clinical care that improved survival for
many chronic illnesses, attention was given to what was described in
the 1980s and 1990s as the “new morbidities”—behavioral, developmental, psychosocial conditions, and societal inequities, which have
been shown to be increasingly associated with suboptimal health outcomes and quality of life. The prevention, early detection, and management of these types of child health problems should be a central focus
of the field of pediatrics and require an expansion in the knowledge
base regarding (1) physical and environmental factors affecting behavior, (2) normal child behavior and development, (3) health behaviors as
they pertain to child health, and (4) mild, moderate, and severe behavioral and developmental disorders. Accomplishing this would require
reconceptualizing professional training, improving clinical communication and interviewing skills, expanding mental health resources for
children, and shifting time allocation during child health supervision

visits to address these concerns. In 2001 this issue was revisited and
reemphasized the need to address environmental and social aspects
in addition to developmental and behavioral issues (Table 1.4). This
included violence, firearms, substance use, food insecurity, and school
problems, as well as poverty, unhoused (homelessness), single-­parent
families, divorce, social media, incarceration, and childcare. Although
at first glance this list seems daunting and beyond the scope of what
pediatricians typically address (i.e., physical health and development),
many of these behavioral, environmental, and psychosocial problems (which all fall under what was termed the “social determinants
of health” but are better characterized as the “social and structural
influences on health”) account for a large proportion of variance in
health outcomes in children and youth. The role of pediatrics and the
boundaries of clinical practice needed to change in order to address
these salient contributors to child health and well-­being. Newer models of clinical care that rely on close collaboration and coordination
with other professionals committed to child welfare (e.g., social workers, psychologists, mental health providers, educators) were developed.
As this model expanded, so did the role of the family, in particular
the child’s caregiver, from a passive recipient of professional services
to a more equitable and inclusive partner in identifying the issues that
needed to be addressed, as well as helping decide which therapeutic
options had the “best fit” with the child, the family, and the condition.
The framing of salient child health issues under the “new morbidity” concept acknowledges that the influences on health are heterogeneous but interconnected. Biology, genetics, healthcare, behaviors,
social conditions, and environmental influences should not be
viewed as mutually exclusive determinants; they exert their influences through complex interactions on multiple levels. For example,
epigenetic changes that result from specific social and environmental
conditions illustrate the influence of context on gene expression.
Studies have demonstrated that while each of these interrelated influences are important for optimal health, development, and well-­being,
the greatest contributions to health outcomes occur in the behavioral,
social, and environmental domains—the social and structural influences
on health. From 40% to 70% of the relative variation in certain health
outcomes are caused by social and economic conditions, health behaviors, and environmental factors, as well as structural inequality in the
healthcare domain. Whereas traditional medical education and clinical
practice emphasized the biologic and genetic determinants of health, the
recognition of the new morbidities as a focus of child healthcare provision reinforced the need to address social and structural influences as a
key component of pediatric care, training, and research.

The “New” New Morbidities

The new morbidities concept brought into perspective the importance
of addressing the social determinants of health, as well as the increasing

prevalence and salience of chronic physical and behavioral health conditions in pediatric healthcare. Since then, advances in epidemiology,
physiology, and epigenetics have expanded the scope of inquiry into
the effects of a broad range of health influences and provided more
sophisticated explanatory models for the mechanisms that explain
their effects (see Table 1.4).

Racism

Although racism is known as “America’s Original Sin,” racism and racial
discrimination is a worldwide problem (see Chapter 2.1). Racism can
occur at the systemic/structural, interpersonal, and internal/psychologic
levels. Structural racism is the hierarchical grouping of people based on
physical attributes, including skin color, which assigns value to those
groups and then allocates certain resources, privileges, and power to
the dominant or in-­group. Structural racism built on White supremacy
and hegemony has been a persistent and plaguing problem for over 400
years. It is racism and racist ideology that have created and perpetuated
pediatric health disparities by race (see Chapters 2 and 2.1). In the aftermath of the state-­sanctioned violence against Black people, there are
calls for the end of racism, police actions, and White supremacy ideology throughout the world. The field of pediatrics did not go untouched
in these discussions, and numerous articles were presented about how to
dismantle structural racism and equip pediatricians with the tools to do
so. Importantly, pediatricians have been called to examine areas in which
racism and harm are perpetuated through healthcare, through policies,
practices, beliefs, and ideals. Racism along with adverse childhood experiences are some of the pressing challenges for the modern-­day pediatrician in promoting equitable health access and outcomes.
The issue of racism is even more relevant by understanding that of
the ∼73,000,000 children in the United States, ∼50% are non-White,
non-­Hispanic (∼26% Hispanic, ∼14% Black, 5% Asian, ∼5% other),
20% speak a language other than English at home, and ∼25% are immigrants or children of immigrants.

Adverse Childhood Experiences

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are stressful events experienced during childhood that can have profound health consequences
both in childhood and throughout the life course into adulthood.
ACEs were initially defined as abuse (physical, emotional, sexual),
neglect (physical and emotional), and household challenges/family
dysfunction (parental spousal abuse, mental illness in household,
household substance abuse, incarceration of household member,
parental separation or divorce). Retrospective studies have shown a
graded dose-­response effect of ACEs on future adult health of those
who experience the adverse event in childhood. For example, more
childhood adversity is associated with significantly increased risk in
later life of ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, liver disease, depression, obesity, and cancer. People who
suffer ≥6 ACEs die almost 20 years earlier than those who had not
experienced ACEs.
Although the original conceptualization of ACEs included family-­
level psychosocial trauma, recent attempts have been made to expand
the concept to include “macro” level stressors, such as those encountered in the neighborhood and community (Table 1.5). These include
witnessing violence in the community, poverty, bullying and peer
victimization, peer isolation, living in unsafe neighborhoods, low
neighborhood social capital, living in foster care, and experiencing discrimination or racism.
ACEs and other psychosocial traumas may influence health through
a number of mechanisms. ACEs are associated with adoption of risky
behaviors such as substance use and early initiation of sexual activity,
which in turn may increase the risk of chronic diseases such as lung
cancer, liver disease, obesity, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection
and cervical cancer, chronic lung disease, and premature mortality.
Childhood trauma can also disrupt neurodevelopment during critical
stages of brain development and contribute to social, emotional, and
cognitive impairment. Finally, ACEs can result in toxic stress and lead
to the dysregulation of normal physiologic processes (see Toxic Stress
and Allostatic Load later).

*Items included in original Kaiser ACE study.

The documentation of cumulative ACE “scores” has value from a
population-­based epidemiologic perspective but has limited clinical
utility. An ACE score gives no information regarding specific adversities and traumas, nor information regarding which interventions
may be required. Although ACE screening may not be the optimal
approach to incorporating a trauma lens into individual clinical care,
a discussion around ACEs can help the clinician to begin collaborative communication with patients and families on the importance of
psychosocial stress and adversity in health and well-­being in childhood
and throughout the life course.
Furthermore, it becomes important to understand that individuals
are not merely a sum of their traumas. Although the recognition of the
importance of ACEs and trauma-­informed care has resulted in the
reframing of the question “what’s wrong with you” to “what’s happened
to you,” this needs to be seen as a transition step toward the goal of
healing-­centered care, which includes an emphasis not only on adversity but also on assets (Fig. 1.2). Those assets may be external (e.g.,
family, community, peers, mentors) or internal (e.g., resilience, positive coping strategies, locus of control). In a healing-­centered model
of care, the evolution of the question “what’s wrong with you” to “what
happened to you” gets further refined to include “what’s right or positive about you.”

Toxic Stress and Allostatic Load

The effects of stress are moderated by the intensity of the stress, the biologic response to the stress, and the social and physical environment in
which the stress is experienced. Toxic stress occurs when a child experiences stressful events that are chronic, intense, or prolonged and are
inadequately buffered by the child’s social support system (most importantly, parents and adult caregivers). Toxic psychosocial stress influences physical health by producing allostatic load, or pathophysiologic
dysregulation of normal regulatory systems. Allostatic load is the “wear
and tear” that the body and its regulatory mechanisms experience in
response to chronic, unbuffered stress. The systems that can be affected
through allostatic load include the neuroendocrine, cardiovascular,
immune, and metabolic systems. Dysregulation of stress hormones in
the hypothalamic-­
pituitary-­
adrenal (HPA) and sympathetic-­
adrenal-­
medullary (SAM) systems, inflammatory cytokines, hormones (e.g.,
insulin), immune factors (e.g., fibrinogen, C-­
reactive protein), and

cardiovascular biomarkers (e.g., blood pressure) can occur from chronic
stress and result in pathophysiologic conditions associated with chronic
diseases. Chronic stress can also have effects at the genetic level. Studies of cellular aging have shown that chronic stress decreases telomere
length, a determinant of aging on the cellular level. Epigenetic changes,
including differential immune system DNA methylation, may occur
after child abuse and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) potentially
contributing to inflammatory and immune dysregulation.*
Pediatrics, developmental psychology, basic sciences, and public
health have contributed significant advances to the study of the behavioral, developmental, and social influences on child health. The influence of psychosocial stress brought about by environmental challenges,
although always acknowledged as important, has taken on a new level
of salience as epidemiologists have linked its occurrence to significant
morbidities throughout the life course and as basic and clinical neuroscience has provided a multilevel framework for understanding how
behavioral and psychosocial issues “get under the skin” to cause physiologic dysfunction and dysregulation. Such a framework can also be
seen as a mechanism underlying health disparities (see Chapter 2).

An ecobiodevelopmental framework has been proposed to integrate the
overlapping influences of environmental (ecologic), biologic, and developmental factors into a model of health and illness. This model posits that
ecology (or the social and physical environment) affects biology through
physiologic disruptions and adaptations secondary to allostatic load
mechanisms. The environment also influences development through life
course science, which includes the effects of toxic exposures and childhood adversity on learning, cognitive, behavioral, and physical health
throughout the life course. Stress-­induced biologic responses to adversity
may negatively affect development and biologic health. Biology influences
development though brain maturation and neuroplasticity, which in turn
are also affected by inputs from the social and physical environment. The
ecobiodevelopmental framework is consistent with the biopsychosocial
model while adding a longitudinal life course developmental dimension.

to primary care. In the United States, 0.4–0.7% of children fall into the
category of “highest medical complexity”; these children account for
15–33% of all healthcare spending for children. Children with medical
complexity account for >70% of hospital readmissions.
Nine of 10 CSHCN have functional difficulties in the sensory, cognitive, movement, emotional, or behavioral domains (Table 1.7). More
than 65% (7.2 million) of CSHCN have conditions that affect their
daily activities, and >2.3 million families experience financial difficulties because of their children’s special health needs. The fact that 25%
of family members of CSHCN cut back work hours or stop working
because of their child’s special needs highlights the social and economic impact of child chronic illness at both the individual and the
national economic level.
Pediatricians are typically the “point persons” in the professional care
of these children and provide data and expert opinion to procure needed
services and resources to the child in the clinic, home, schools, and community. Such demands require an efficient model of chronic care.

CHRONIC ILLNESS AND CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL
HEALTHCARE NEEDS

SYSTEMS OF CARE
Population Health Approach

Ecobiodevelopmental Framework

The care of children with chronic conditions has become an increasingly
larger part of clinical pediatrics for both the pediatric subspecialist and
the general pediatrician. Children and youth with special healthcare
needs (CSHCN) are defined by the U.S. Maternal and Child Health
Bureau as “those who have or are at increased risk for a chronic physical,
developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition and who also require
health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required
by children generally.” According to the 2018–2019 National Survey of
Children’s Health (NSCH), >14.1 million, or 19% of U.S. children, have
a special health need. The 2009–2010 National Survey of Children with
Special Health Care Needs (NS-­CSHCN) reports that almost one quarter
(23%) of U.S. households with children have a child with a special need.
The conditions these children have are extremely heterogeneous, as
shown in Table 1.6. Most of these children need specialty care in addition
*Editor Note: Community members and some healthcare workers refer to this disorder as
“hood disease.”

Because pediatric practice is increasingly spent working with patients
and families who have chronic issues and conditions, new approaches
to healthcare services delivery have been proposed. Whereas traditional practice models concentrate efforts toward the preventive and
therapeutic needs of those patients who present for care, a population health approach to care refocuses efforts to emphasize the need
to address health from a community-­or population-­level perspective,
with emphasis on identifying and addressing the needs of individuals
and families who do not seek regular care or whose care is episodic
and suboptimal from a prevention or management standpoint. Effectiveness of such a system improves with greater collaboration between
healthcare providers and payers (insurance companies) to identify gaps
in care, with data surveillance systems and electronic health records
(EHRs) and with an expanded cadre of healthcare personnel such
as care coordinators, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, social
workers, health navigators, and community health workers. Healthcare reimbursement modifications, such as incorporating value-­based

and quality-­of-­care–based models, if implemented correctly, may further advance a population health approach to care.

Medical Home

The concept of the patient and family–centered medical home
(PFCMH) approach to providing care is defined as a medical home
that provides care that is accessible, continuous, comprehensive,
family-­
centered, coordinated, compassionate, and culturally effective. Patients and family members are key active participants, working
with clinicians to identify priorities for and approaches to care (shared
decision-­making; see Chapter 18). A key aspect of the PFCMH is
care coordination. Care coordination “addresses interrelated medical, social, developmental, behavioral, educational and financial needs
to achieve optimal health and wellness outcomes.” A care coordinator is the “point person” on the team who prospectively identifies the
patient’s and family’s needs, concerns, and priorities for the healthcare
visit, gathers pertinent information (lab results, consultations, educational plans, screening/testing results), communicates with subspecialists, and relays all important information to the clinical team before
the patient/family visit. After a healthcare visit, the care coordinator
works with the family to address any ongoing concerns, directs efforts
to schedule follow-­up appointments and referrals, and communicates
information to all necessary parties. The care coordinator typically is
not a physician. The intended result of care coordination is an efficient
and comprehensive interaction between the pediatric team and the
family, between primary care and specialty care, between ambulatory
and inpatient care teams, and between the pediatric care team and the
community-­based supports on which the patient and family depend.
Provision of care consistent with the elements of a medical home has
been associated with more accurate and early diagnosis, fewer emergency department visits and inpatient hospitalizations, lower costs,
fewer unmet needs, lower out-­of-­pocket medical costs, less impact on
parental employment, fewer school absences, and better patient satisfaction. According to the 2016 NSCH, 43% of U.S. CSHCN and 50%
of U.S. children without a SHCN received coordinated, comprehensive
care within a medical home.

Medical and Health Neighborhood

Although the medical home concept relates to practice transformation specific to primary care, a broadening of this concept has been
proposed along two separate dimensions. The medical neighborhood
expands the medical home concept and refers to coordinated and efficient integration between primary care pediatricians and the subspecialists, including integrated EHRs, efficient coordinated appointment

scheduling, and enhanced communication. Such a system has the
potential to provide a less stressful patient and family experience and
could also lead to cost reduction and a decrease in medical errors.
Another expansion and modification of the medical home is the
health neighborhood concept. The health neighborhood is based on the
recognition of the importance of coordination with community-­based
and nonmedical providers to address comprehensively and efficiently
the social and structural influences on health. Health neighborhoods
include the healthcare providers (consistent with the medical home and
neighborhood) but also involve services such as early intervention programs, the education system, childcare, community-­based behavioral
and mental health services, legal services, nutritional support services,
and other clinical and community-­based services that the patient and
family need to access. The health neighborhood team helps families
identify the needs of the patient, assists with referrals to appropriate
agencies outside the healthcare system, and coordinates care.
Some nonmedical services may be co-­located at the medical office.
Medical-­legal partnerships (MLPs) are collaborations between the
healthcare and legal systems and embed legal aid personnel in the medical
clinic. These lawyers and legal paraprofessionals can provide direct services to patients and families who have legal issues that may be affecting
the child’s health (e.g., housing code violations, utility shutoff, food insecurity, immigration issues, educational accommodations, guardianship). In
addition to providing direct services, MLPs train healthcare personnel in
the legal, social, and structural influences on health and work with physicians and others to advocate for policy change. Other nonmedical health
neighborhood services that could be co-­located in the medical center
include supplemental nutrition assistance programs, parenting programs,
behavioral health services, and family financial counseling.
Many, if not most, other services are located in the community.
The health neighborhood model links families to these services and
provides efficient ongoing coordination and communication. Community health workers or health navigators are paraprofessional team
members who are community and culturally informed and serve as a
coordinating link between the family, the medical home, and needed
community services. Community health workers and health navigators
can also provide patient and family education.
Expanded care models such as these have the potential to achieve what
the Institute for Healthcare Improvement calls the “quadruple aim” for
healthcare: focusing on care (improving the patient experience with
healthcare, quality care, and satisfaction), health (improving the health
of populations, including emphasis on equity), provider satisfaction

Child Health Disparities
Lee M. Pachter and Adiaha I.A.Spinks-­Franklin
Health and illness are not distributed equally among all members in
most societies. Differences exist in historical roots, risk factors, prevalence and incidence, manifestations, severity, and outcome of health conditions, as well as in the availability and quality of healthcare. When these
differences are modifiable and avoidable, they are referred to as disparities or inequities. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
(DHHS) Healthy People 2030 report defines health disparity as “a particular type of health difference that is closely linked with social, economic,
and/or environmental disadvantage. Health disparities adversely affect
groups of people who have systematically experienced greater obstacles
to health based on their racial or ethnic group; religion; socioeconomic
status; gender; age; mental health; cognitive, sensory, or physical disability; sexual orientation or gender identity; geographic location; or other
characteristics historically linked to discrimination or exclusion.” The
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) define health
disparities as “preventable differences in the burden of disease, injury,
violence, or in opportunities to achieve optimal health experienced by
socially disadvantaged racial, ethnic, and other population groups, and
communities.” Healthy People 2030 defines health equity as “the attainment of the highest level of health for all people. Achieving health equity
requires valuing everyone equally with focused and ongoing societal
efforts to address avoidable inequalities, historical and contemporary
injustices, and the elimination of health and health care disparities.”
Health and healthcare disparities occur because of unequal distribution
of resources that are inherent in societies that exhibit social stratification,
which occurs in social systems that rank and categorize people into a
hierarchy of unequal status and power.

emphasize the most modifiable determinants of health: the physical
and social environment, psychology and health behaviors, socioeconomic position and status, and access to and quality of healthcare
(and the policies that place marginalized groups at greater risk based
on these determinants). Differential access to these resources results
in differences in material resources (e.g., money, education, healthcare) or psychosocial factors (e.g., locus of control, adaptive or risky
behaviors, stress, social connectedness) that may contribute to differences in health status. This section will explore several historical
social and structural root contributors to health disparities (see also
Chapter 2.1).

Federal Policies and Economic Outcomes
Redlining (1933–1960)

A federally backed homeowner mortgage banking system, the Homeowners Loan Corporation (HOLC), was created in the 1930s and graded
neighborhoods on credit risk for investment and mortgage lending into
four color-­coded levels that were outlined on city maps. The four color-­
coded levels were based primarily on racial and ethnic demographics
rather than economic factors, with the 2 most desirable codes being for
more affluent White neighborhoods. Neighborhoods defined as “Definitely Declining” were marked in yellow and were older neighborhoods
with mixed ethnic makeup, including lower-­income White residents and
European immigrant residents, but no Black residents. Residents in these
communities were allowed to get homeowner mortgages, but there was
less overall economic development. Neighborhoods defined as “Hazardous” were marked in red (hence the term redlined communities) and were
where Blacks lived, including affluent Blacks. Residents in these neighborhoods were denied homeowner mortgages and were systematically
disinvested by local, state, and federal government policies.
The Federal Housing Authority (FHA), created in 1934 to be the
government entity that would federally secure homeowner mortgages,
created underwriting manuals for banks with rules regarding lending
practices that included denying loans to Black applicants and devaluating properties in redlined neighborhoods. Therefore from the 1930s to
1960s, 98% of FHA homeowner mortgage loans were given to White
Americans. This led to decades of residential housing segregation.
Redlining was officially outlawed by the Fair Housing Act of 1968;
however, the impact of redlining continues.

Urban Renewal (1949–1974)

After World War II, city officials and city planners across the United
States described urban areas as “slums,” full of poor people and in
blight. At the same time, the Great Migration (1916–1970) changed
the racial makeup for northern cities, when millions of rural southern
Black farm workers, domestic workers, laborers, and their families left
the harsh Jim Crow segregated conditions of the South and migrated to
northern cities seeking a better life and improved economic conditions
and opportunities. The leaders in northern destination cities sought
to control and contain these southern Black Americans. The federal
government passed the Housing Act of 1949 to provide funding to cities across the country to clear and redevelop the slums (called “slum
clearance”). City leaders and planners used the funds to revitalize their
downtown areas to woo suburban Whites for shopping and entertainment and simultaneously target redlined communities to demolish old
buildings and houses and move poor Black and brown residents into
public housing facilities (called “housing projects”). In 1956, the Eisenhower administration passed the Federal-­Aid Highway Act of 1956
that created the national interstate system. Redlined communities were
targeted for placement of these interstate highways that displaced Black
and brown residents into segregated housing projects. All of these federal policies led to the following consequences affecting public health:
• Residential housing segregation: Fifty-­plus years of discriminatory
homeowner lending practices, real estate practices, and economic
disinvestment have led to hypersegregation of neighborhoods and
resources. Black and Latinx residents are more likely to live in neighborhoods where the majority of residents have incomes below the
federal poverty level, which is referred to as concentrated poverty.
Residents living in formerly redlined neighborhoods have poorer

health outcomes, including higher rates of asthma, cancer, heart
disease, and premature birth and shorter life expectancies. They are
at higher risk of being exposed to environmental toxins, including
lead, mold, exhaust pollutants and greenhouse gases, that all contribute to poor health. Residential housing segregation has other
significant health consequences for Black and Latinx American children, including living in food deserts (having few grocery stores in
neighborhoods), digital deserts (lack of access to reliable high-­speed
internet), having fewer green spaces, and few pharmacies.
• Economic disparities, racial wealth gap, and concentrated poverty:
Federal policies during the 1930s and 1940s created the foundation for
racial wealth gaps. The Social Security Administration and the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944 (the GI Bill) were established to create a middle class. The Social Security system was created to provide
income to older adults. However, farmworkers and domestic workers
were not included among the professionals that would pay into the Social Security system. These occupations employed predominantly Black
laborers, who did not benefit from the initial Social Security policy. The GI
Bill provided former World War II military soldiers with low-­interest
home, farm, and business loans; funds to pay for higher education; and
unemployment assistance. White and Japanese American soldiers were
granted the financial benefits from the GI Bill to buy homes and attend
college. However, millions of Black soldiers were denied the GI Bill.
First American (i.e., Indigenous Nations peoples) WWII veterans used
the GI Bill to pay for a college education, but could not use the GI Bill
to buy homes on reservations because reservation land was excluded
from the GI Bill. Mexican American soldiers did not have full access
to the benefits of the GI Bill for homeownership, but some were able
to benefit from job training. Therefore millions of Black, Indigenous
Nations peoples, and Mexican American WWII veterans did not receive all the financial and educational benefits of the GI Bill. White
Americans have accumulated 10 times the wealth of Black Americans,
which has transgenerational implications. Discriminatory hiring and
firing practices place minoritized workers at higher risk of chronic underemployment and unemployment. Additionally, there is an ongoing
racial and gendered racial pay gap between White American men and
women and men and women who are Black, Asian American, Latinx
American, and Indigenous Nations peoples. In 2021, for every dollar a
White American man made, Asian American women made 85 cents,
Black women made 63 cents, Indigenous Nations women made 60
cents, and Latina American women made 57 cents.
• School segregation and educational underfunding: Public schools
are funded by property taxes. In hypersegregated communities with
concentrated poverty, schools are underfunded, with a 2019 study
reporting a $23 billion funding gap between school districts with
predominantly White students and school districts with predominantly Black, Latinx, and Indigenous Nations students. This funding gap leads to schools with less qualified teachers, less rigorous

curricula, and fewer extracurricular activities. Black, Latinx, and
Indigenous Nations students have overpolicing and harsher school
punishment practices, as discussed further in Chapter 2.1. Schools
are not teaching BIPOC students self-discipline; they are over-­
punishing and criminalizing these students.
• Environmental injustice: There are racial disparities in who suffers the
health consequences of climate change. Residential housing segregation and environmental policies have contributed to unequal exposure
to environmental toxins. White Americans produce the majority of
greenhouse gas emissions but experience less of the negative health effects of such emissions such as asthma, other chronic lung disease, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Black and Latinx American children
in hypersegregated neighborhoods are also more likely to be exposed
to lead poisoning compared with their White American counterparts.
Lead exposure increases the risk of health problems, including anemia,
attention regulation problems, and learning problems. Increased exposure to mold and other major asthma triggers contributes to disparities
in asthma outcomes among children of color and poor children. Residential housing segregation also places communities of color at risk for
poor water quality and the health consequences.
Figure 2.2 illustrates the complex relations among multileveled factors and health outcomes. Historical social stratification factors, such
as socioeconomic status (SES), race, and gender, have profound influences on environmental resources available to individuals and groups,
including neighborhood factors (e.g., safety, environmental toxins,
grocery stores, transportation, healthy spaces), social connectedness
and support, work opportunities, and family environment. Much of the
differential access to these resources results from historical discrimination on a systematic, institutional, and interpersonal level (see Chapter
2.1). Discriminatory policies place historically subordinated groups
at greater risk of poorer health outcomes and psychologic functioning, including sense of control over one’s life, expectations, resiliency,
negative affect, and perceptions of and response to discrimination.
Environmental and psychologic context then have influence over more
proximal determinants of health, including health-­promoting or risk-­
promoting behaviors; access to and quality of healthcare and health
education; exposure to pathogens, toxins, and carcinogens; pathophysiologic responses to stress; and the resources available to support
optimal child development.

Psychosocial Stress and Allostatic Load

An understanding of allostatic load helps explain how psychosocial
stress influences disease, health outcomes, and health disparities (Fig.
2.3 and Chapter 1). Allostasis refers to the normal physiologic changes
that occur when individuals experience a stressful event, including activation of the stress-­response systems, changes in levels of inflammatory and immune mediators, cardiovascular reactivity, and metabolic
and hormone activation. These are normal and adaptive responses to

stress and result in physiologic stability in the face of an external challenge. After an acute external stress or challenge, these systems revert
to normal baseline states.
However, when the stressor becomes chronic and unbuffered by
social supports, dysregulation of these systems may occur, resulting in
pathophysiologic alterations to these responses, such as hyperactivation of the allostatic systems, or burnout. Over time this dysregulation
contributes to increased risk of disease and dysfunction. This pathophysiologic response is called allostatic load.
Allostatic load may contribute to increased incidence of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, obesity, asthma,
and depression. It is notable that these specific chronic diseases have
increased prevalence in racial and ethnic minority groups because of
long-­standing historical and current discrimination and oppression
that have contributed to increased psychologic distress that in turn contributes to allostatic load and the resultant disparities in these chronic
diseases. Many of these conditions are noted to occur in adulthood,
demonstrating the life course consequences of chronic psychosocial
stress and adversity that begins in childhood. Figure 2.3 shows a model
through which racism as a toxic psychosocial stressor “gets under the
skin” to cause physiologic dysregulation (allostatic load), which over
time leads to chronic illnesses that are known to have higher prevalence in minoritized populations (health disparities).
The allostatic load model provides a pathophysiologic mechanism
through which negative structural and social determinants of health
contribute to health disparities. It complements other mechanisms
noted in Figure 2.2, such as differential access to healthcare; increase
in health risk behaviors; and increased exposure to pathogens, toxins,
and other unhealthy agents.

The Healthy Immigrant Paradox

The Healthy Immigrant Paradox refers to the epidemiologic finding that
first-­generation immigrants have better health than native-­born counterparts regardless of age, sex, economic status, or ethnic category, but
their health status declines and converges with the native-­born population over time. Studies in the United States and Europe have found that
most immigrants have better physical and psychologic health status than
native-­born people of similar ethnicity in their receiving country. There
are a variety of possible explanations for this health difference, including

self-­selection bias among people who emigrate: being younger, more
educated, and physically healthier than those in the country of origin
who do not emigrate. In addition, immigrants may bring healthier
cultural beliefs and practices that may contribute to better health outcomes. However, the health status of immigrant populations declines in
the decades after initial migration because of a variety of complex sociopolitical and economic reasons, including denial of access to healthcare
services (e.g., laws that prohibit immigrants from having access to
preventive health services), having jobs with unsafe work conditions,
adopting poorer health habits, and the psychologic stress of adapting to
a new society (i.e., acculturation stress) (see Fig. 12.1).
The Healthy Immigrant Paradox is not universal and has been called
into question by some. Many studies of the Healthy Immigrant Paradox use self-­report of health status, which may be prone to bias. Not
all first-­generation immigrants demonstrate better health than their
U.S.-­born counterparts. Immigrant health status can be influenced
by country-­of-­origin factors (e.g., war, famine), health beliefs (e.g.,
perceiving obesity to be a sign of wealth rather than of poor health),
and racialized immigration policies in the receiving country that
favor immigrants from some countries over others. Many studies of
the Healthy Immigrant Paradox do not include temporary immigrant
workers who often do not have the same access to resources as do
longer-­term immigrants.
Approximately 18.4 million, or 25% of children in the United States
under age 12 years, have at least one immigrant parent. Children of
immigrant parents have better health and academic outcomes compared with their U.S.-­born counterparts. For example, Latinx and
Asian children who are born to immigrant parents (second generation)
and those brought to the United States as children (1.5 generation)
have better study habits and better academic outcomes compared with
third-­generation U.S.-­born Latinx and Asian American counterparts.
Behavioral health outcomes also vary among immigrant children and
their U.S.-­born counterparts, where third-­generation and subsequent
generation children engage in more risky health behaviors.

Child Health Disparities
Asthma

Disparities in asthma prevalence are seen by racial/ethnic group and
SES. According to the CDC’s 2019 National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS) data, the national mean prevalence of asthma among children (<18 years old) was 7.0%. Compared with the mean, the children
with the highest prevalence of asthma were Black (18.0%), Indigenous
Nation/Alaskan Native (17.8%), and Hispanic (12.5%). Asthma prevalence for Asian American children was 8.2%. There are also significant
regional and SES differences in asthma prevalence, with children who
live below the federal poverty level having a 14.5% prevalence.
Exposure to environmental pollutants is one factor explaining these
disparities in asthma prevalence. Although non-­Hispanic White Americans consume the most goods and services that produce greenhouse
gases (e.g., fine particulate matter), Black and Hispanic Americans have
higher exposure to greenhouse gases that are associated with poor health
outcomes, including asthma. Residential hypersegregation results in
higher exposure to air pollution and other respiratory toxins for Black
and Hispanic Americans, increasing their risk of asthma. In addition,
evidence shows a correlation between exposure to traffic pollutants and
having fewer local pharmacies and healthcare providers. This “triple
jeopardy” is more common with Black and Hispanic children.

Obesity

In 2018, the National Center for Health Statistics found that 19.3%
of all U.S. children and adolescents (ages 6-­17 years) have obesity
(Fig. 2.4). Obesity prevalence was highest among Hispanic children
(25.6%) and non-­Hispanic Black children (24.2%). The prevalence
of obesity was 16.1% among non-­Hispanic White children and 8.7%
among non-­Hispanic Asian children. The obesity prevalence among
Indigenous Nation/Alaskan Native adolescents is 11.0% and among
Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders is 26.7%. There are complex interplays between social, environmental, and behavioral influences on
health that contribute to obesity disparities in the United States. Studies

that are deemed to be socially, politically, geographically, and economically inferior. As a result of these targeted policies, we tend to see health
disparities of people based upon racial/ethnic group, socioeconomic
status (often operationalized through family income, sometimes using
insurance status as a proxy), and residency patterns, such as urban and
rural locale. Other stratification factors, such as ability/disability status,
may also contribute to health and healthcare inequality

have found that obesity prevalence is higher in communities with high
rates of poverty and communities with a majority Black population
because of lack of access to grocery stores and farmers markets (food
deserts), overabundance of fast-­food restaurants, less access to parks
and outdoor recreation areas, food marketing targeting, and higher
healthy food prices. In addition, dietary patterns, access to nutritious foods, and differing cultural norms regarding body habitus may
account for some of these differences.

infant mortality rate was 5.7 infants per 1,000 live births. For Black
infants, the mortality rate was 10.8 infants per 1,000 live births. The top
5 causes of mortality (in order of frequency) among Black infants were
low birthweight, congenital malformations, maternal complications,
sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and unintended injuries. Black
American infant mortality remains high compared with other populations, regardless of maternal education, insurance status, maternal age,
and income.
Chronic experiences with structural, institutional, and interpersonal racism contribute to elevated biomarkers for stress and allostatic
load, which is referred to as weathering—the accumulative effect of
adversity on the health of individuals (see Chapter 2.1). Weathering
of Black women has been associated with a risk of preterm birth and
infant mortality. When examining the life-­course perspective, studies
suggest that early life exposure to adversity, including systemic racism,
increases the risk of poor birth outcomes (see Chapter 2.1). Having
a racially concordant physician significantly reduces the risk of infant
mortality by 39% among Black newborns.
Infant mortality rates among Indigenous Nation/Alaskan Native populations was 8.2 infants per 1,000 live births, with the leading causes of
infant death (in order of frequency) being low birthweight, congenital
malformations, and maternal complications. Asian American infants
had the lowest infant mortality rates, at 3.8 infants per 1,000 live births,
with the leading causes of death (in order of frequency) being congenital malformations, low birthweight, maternal complications, and unintended injuries. The Asian American population was not disaggregated
by country of origin, so granular details regarding this heterogenous
American population were not available. Overall Hispanic infant mortality was 4.9 infants per 1,000 live births, but mortality rates varied significantly based upon country of origin from 3.8 to 5.6 per 1,000 live
births. Leading causes of death among all Hispanic infants (in order of
frequency) were congenital malformations, low birthweight, maternal
complications, SIDS, and unintended injuries. The White American
infant mortality rate was 4.6 infants per 1,000 live births, with the leading causes of infant mortality (in order of frequency) being congenital
malformations, low birthweight, SIDS, unintended injuries, and maternal complications (see Chapters 114 and 114.1).
Infant mortality among the Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander population was 9.4 infants per 1,000 live births overall. Infant mortality
rates varied in the Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander population when
the data were disaggregated by country of origin from 10.1 to 22.5 per
1,000 live births. In 2017, the World Health Organization (WHO),
UNICEF, and United Nations (UN) highlighted some of the social and
environmental risk factors for such high infant mortality among Pacific
Islanders, which include prematurity, birth complications, and severe
infections (specifically, pneumonia and diarrheal illnesses). Infant
mortality among Native Hawaiians was 9.4 infants per 1,000 live births,
and the leading causes of infant mortality were preterm birth and low
birthweight, sudden unexplained infant death, congenital anomalies,
infection, and injury.
Many of the causes of infant mortality disparities can be mitigated
through public policy, public health measures, and healthcare interventions that specifically target populations at highest risk, such as
increased access to quality prenatal care, reducing air pollution exposure, and improving physician training to reduce implicit bias and
improve communication skills.

Oral Health

Significant differences exist in oral health status and in preventive oral
healthcare according to race/ethnicity, SES, and residency locale. The
2019–2020 National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH) found the
prevalence of oral health problems among children (ages 1-­17 years) to
be 17.7% for Hispanic Americans, 16.2% for Black Americans, 15.8%
for Asian Americans, 12.1% for White Americans, and 13.2% for other
non-­Hispanic Americans. The prevalence of oral health problems in
this 2019-­2020 NSCH were found to be highest among children who
live in households with incomes below the federal poverty level (20.3%)
compared with children who live in households making >400% of the
federal poverty level (8.7%).

Data from the CDC demonstrated that overall prevalence of dental
caries decreased for children age 6-­11 years: from 21% in the 1994–
2004 NHANES survey to 17% in the 2011–2016 survey. The children in
the survey who did not show improvements in the prevalence of dental caries were younger children (ages 6-­8 years), poor children (both
near-­poor and children living below the federal poverty level), and
non-­Hispanic Black children. Preventive oral healthcare may improve
rates of caries and treat caries before further impairment ensues. Data
from the 2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey revealed that being
poor and lacking health insurance were the main reasons for not
receiving preventive dental care.

Hearing Care

No data suggest that the prevalence of hearing loss (either congenital
or acquired) is different among racial/ethnic or SES categories, but follow-­up care after diagnosis of a hearing problem has been shown to be
poorer in certain groups. Delays in diagnosis and treatment of hearing
loss are found among children who lack health insurance, live farther
away from diagnostic health centers, are poor, live in areas with specialists’ shortages, live in rural areas, and have primary care providers
with limited experience in caring for children with hearing loss. Much
of this disparity is reduced when families have access to specialists.

Vision Problems

The parent-­reported 2019–2020 NSCH found that vision problems
were reported in 3.1% of Hispanic children, 1.2% of White children,
2.1% of Black children, 1.0% of Asian children, and 1.6% of children
in other racial categories. Vision problems were more commonly
reported among children who lived in households with an income that
was less than the federal poverty level (3.4%) compared with children
living in households with an income greater than 400% of the federal
poverty level (0.8%). Vision problems were more commonly reported
among children who did not have a medical home (2.6%) compared
with children with a medical home (1.0%). Reports of vision problems
in children also varied by insurance coverage type, with 0.9% of children with private health insurance, 3.0% of children with public health
insurance, 3.0% of children with both public and private health insurance, and 4.1% among uninsured children.

Immunization

Disparities in immunization rates had been noted with household
income status, insurance status, and residential location. In response to
these socioeconomic disparities and to higher rates of measles cases in
the 1980s, a number of interventions were initiated, including the creation of the Vaccines for Children program (VFC), which eliminated
the financial barrier to immunization by providing free immunizations
to at-­risk groups (Medicaid-­eligible, uninsured, Indigenous Nation/
Alaskan Native, or underinsured and vaccinated at a federally qualified health center or rural health clinic). Although vaccination rates
have improved, the 2018–2020 CDC National Immunization Survey—
Child study found income, geographic, and racial disparities in infant
vaccination rates. Vaccination rates were lower among infants living in
households with an income below the federal poverty level and infants
who lacked health insurance. Vaccination rates varied widely by state
and region of the United States.
Although rates of initial primary vaccine series demonstrate no or
decreasing disparities, other vaccination rates do show differences.
Black and Hispanic adolescent females have lower human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates than do Whites. Reasons for this disparity
include parental concerns about safety and providers not recommending the vaccine. Of interest, Black and Hispanic male adolescents have
higher rates of HPV vaccine coverage than do Whites.

Adolescent Suicide

In 2019, the CDC Youth Behavior Risk Surveillance System of 9th-­12th
graders reported suicide attempts by racial category, sex, and sexual orientation. The highest rate of suicide attempts was among Indigenous
Nations/Alaskan Native teens (25.5%), followed by Native Hawaiian/
Pacific Islanders (18.4%), multiracial teens (12.9%), Blacks (11.8%),

Latinx Americans (8.9%), White Americans (7.9%), and Asian Americans (7.7%). Suicide attempts were higher among adolescent females
(11.0%) than among adolescent males (6.6%). Suicide attempts vary
when stratified by sexual orientation status, with the highest prevalence
among bisexual teens (24.5%), followed by gay male teens (19.5%) and
heterosexual teens (6.4%). Risk factors for suicide ideations and attempts
include sexual assault, being bullied, substance abuse, depression, and
experiences with interpersonal racial discrimination (see Chapter 40).

Child Maltreatment

In 2014, reports of child abuse and neglect were higher in Black (15.3 per
1,000 children), Indigenous Nation/Alaskan Native (13.4/1,000), and
multiracial (10.6/1,000) children, compared with Hispanic (8.8/1,000),
Pacific Islander (8.6/1,000), White (8.4/1,000), and Asian (1.7/1,000) children. Poverty, measured at the family and at the community level, is also a
significant risk factor for maltreatment. Counties with high poverty concentration had >3 times the rate of child abuse deaths than counties with
the lowest concentration of poverty. Additionally, it is the “criminalization” of poverty that increases the risk of poor people being reported for
abuse and neglect compared to their more affluent counterparts. However,
despite the fact that Black children are overrepresented in the child welfare system in the United States, race itself should not be a marker for child
abuse or neglect. Studies have found that Black parents are overreported for
child abuse and maltreatment compared with White parents who engage in
the same behavior because of historical systemic racism and implicit racial
bias among those who report and caseworkers. Latinx children’s representation in the child welfare system varies by state and region, where they
are overrepresented in some states, but underrepresented in other states.
Indigenous Nation/Alaskan Native youth are underrepresented in the
child welfare system in most states, but Alaska is the state with the highest
overrepresentation of Indigenous children reported to the child welfare
system. White American children are not overrepresented in the child
welfare system and are often underrepresented.

Behavioral Health Disparities
Attention-­Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)

The 2019–2020 NSCH found the overall prevalence of ADHD among
children age 3-­17 years to be 8.9%. White and Black children are more
often diagnosed with ADHD (10.2% and 10.5%, respectively) than are
Hispanic children (6.9%), Asian American children (2.7%), and children of other non-­Hispanic groups (8.5%). Other studies have shown
that both Black and Hispanic children have lower odds of having an
ADHD diagnosis than White children. Children reared in homes with
a household income below the federal poverty level are diagnosed more
often (10.9%) than those at or above the federal poverty level (8.3%).
Children with two or more adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are
almost 3 times as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD (17.1%) compared
with children with no ACEs (5.8%). Children without a medical home
are more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD (9.7%) compared with
children who have a medical home (8.0%).
Children diagnosed with ADHD have different treatment experiences. After being diagnosed with ADHD, White children, when
compared with Black and Hispanic children, were more likely to be
diagnosed with a coexisting anxiety disorder. Within the first year of
treatment for ADHD, White children were most likely to be treated
with medication or behavior therapy and Asian American children
were the least likely to receive any type of treatment for ADHD.

Depression and Anxiety Disorders

According to the 2020 National Survey of Drug Use and Health, from
2004 to 2019, the reported prevalence of major depression episodes
increased among all U.S. adolescents. In 2019, those with the highest reported prevalence of a major depression episode were 16-­to
17-­year-­olds (20.2%), adolescent girls (23.0%), adolescents of two or
more races (20.9%), and teens living in households with incomes above
the federal poverty level (16.1%).
When stratifying by racial group, a major depression episode was
found in 17.3% of Hispanic teens, 15.9% of White teens, 15.1% of Asian
American teens, 12.2% of Indigenous Nation/Alaska Native teens, and

11.4% of Black teens. Differences in reported rates of depression based
upon racial group may be the result of differences in the manifestation
of depression symptoms, clinician treatment bias, and limited access to
adequate mental healthcare.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

Compared with White children, Black and Hispanic children are less
likely to be diagnosed with ASD, and when diagnosed, are typically diagnosed at a later age and with more severe symptoms. Nonetheless, Blacks
and Hispanics are typically diagnosed at a later age and with more severe
symptoms. Disparities in diagnosis and timing of diagnosis are concerning given that early diagnosis provides access to therapeutic services that
are most effective when initiated early. Reasons for these disparities may
include differences in cultural behavioral norms, stigma, differences in
parental knowledge of typical and atypical child development, poorer
access to quality healthcare, and differences in the quality of provider-­
patient communication along with trust in providers. Recent CDC data
suggest that racial and ethnic disparities in ASD diagnosis are decreasing.

Behavioral or Conduct Problems

According to the 2011–2012 NSCH, Black children age 2-­17 years
have higher rates of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) or conduct
disorder than do White and Hispanic children. Evidence suggests that
the overdiagnosis of Black children with these disorders is linked to the
pervasive criminalization and adultification of Black child behavior.
Adults often view Black children as older, less innocent, and in less
need of protection than same-­age peers of other racial groups. In fact,
studies have found that physicians with negative implicit racial bias are
more likely to overpathologize Black child behavior and overdiagnose
Black children with ODD, conduct disorder, and ADHD. The pathologizing of Black child behavior can have severe consequences, including
excessive school punishment, school expulsion, and early contact with
the legal system.

Developmental Delay

The 2019–2020 NSCH found that Black children age 3-­17 years had
higher reported rates of developmental delay (7.4%) than Hispanic children (5.3%), White children (5.4%), and other non-­Hispanic children
(5.4%). Children living in households with incomes below the federal
poverty level were more likely to be diagnosed with a developmental
delay (8.7%) than children living in households with an income at 400%
of the federal poverty level (3.6%). Children experiencing two or more
ACEs have a higher prevalence of developmental delay than do children
with no ACEs (10.8% vs 3.8%). ACEs increase the child’s allostatic load
and impede neurologic development, thus placing them at increased
risk of developmental delays. Evidence also suggests that physicians
with negative implicit racial biases are less likely to ask Black parents
and parents who speak English less fluently about their concerns regarding developmental delays and are less likely to refer the children to early
intervention, and these children are less likely to receive appropriate
developmental evaluations by early intervention providers.

Flourishing

In the 2019–2020 NSCH, parents reported rates of flourishing, which is
overall good mental health in their children and teens. Flourishing was
measured by three behaviors: learning, resilience, and self-­regulation.
Overall, 63.3% of parents reported their child met all three flourishing criteria. Females (66.8%) were reported as having higher flourishing than males (59.9%). The highest level of flourishing was reported
among Asian American youth (73.0%), followed by White (64.8%),
other non-­Hispanic children (62.1%), Black (61.8%), and Hispanic
(59.7%). Flourishing rates were lowest among youth who live in households with incomes lower than the federal poverty level (55.6%) and
highest among youth living in families with incomes higher than 400%
of the federal poverty level (70.0%).

Child Healthcare Disparities

In almost all areas, Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous Nation/Alaskan
Native children have been identified as having worse access to needed

healthcare, including receipt of any type of medical care within the
past 12 months, well-­child or preventive visits, delay in care, having
an unmet need because of healthcare cost, lack of care in a medical
home, problems accessing specialist care when needed, lack of preventive dental care, vision screening, mental health counseling, and
recommendations for adolescent immunizations (see Table 2.2). In
addition, many of these healthcare indicators are found to be worse for
children living in poverty and for those living in a rural area. Disparities in access to and quality of healthcare among children of color and
poor children are linked to long-­standing structural barriers, systemic
racist policies and practices, environmental policies, social and structural determinants of health, and healthcare provider negative implicit
racial biases that influence healthcare delivery and patient-­physician
communication and relationships.

APPROACHES TO ERADICATING DISPARITIES:
INTERVENTIONS

An example of a successful intervention that closed the disparity gap is
the implementation of the VFC program, which significantly decreased
the disparity in immunization rates noted among racial/ethnic groups
and poor/underinsured children. This is an example of a public health
policy approach to intervention.
Interventions need to occur at the clinical level as well. The almost-­
universal use of electronic health records (EHRs) provides a unique
opportunity for collecting vital clinical and demographic data that
can be helpful in identifying disparities and monitoring the success of
interventions. All EHR platforms should use a standardized approach
to gathering information on patient race/ethnicity, SES, primary language preferences, and health literacy. The Institute of Medicine’s 2009
report Race, Ethnicity, and Language Data: Standardization for Health
Care Quality Improvement provides best practices information about
capturing these data in the health record.
The advancing science of clinical quality improvement can also
provide a framework for identifying clinical strategies to reduce disparities in care. Use of PDSA (Plan-­Do-­Study-­Act) cycles targeting
specific clinical issues where health disparities exist can result in practice transformation and help reduce differential outcomes.
Another practice-­level intervention that has the potential to reduce
disparities in care and outcomes is the medical home model, providing care that is accessible, family centered, continuous, comprehensive,
compassionate, coordinated, and culturally effective. The use of care
coordinators and using community-­based health navigators are effective tools in helping to break down the multiple social and health system barriers that contribute to disparities.
Community engagement is an essential requirement for lessening
health and healthcare inequities. Health systems, practices, providers, public health, researchers, and payers need to include community
voice and representation in all aspects of quality improvement, data
interpretation, program design and development, and dissemination.
To do less would be “working on people” instead of “working with people.” To use a phrase from the disability advocacy community: “Nothing
about us without us.” Many potential interventions seem appropriate
and demonstrate efficacy under ideal circumstances. However, if the
intervention does not address the concerns of the end users—patients
and communities—or fit the social or cultural context, it will likely be
ineffective in the “real world.” Only by involving the community from
the beginning, including defining the issues and problems, can the likelihood of success be optimized.
At the provider level, there are opportunities for training in implicit
bias and communication skills, as discussed in Chapter 2.1. Shared
decision-­making has been found to improve physician-­patient relationships and health outcomes. Another strategy to address cognitive
biases in physician clinical decision-­making is to identify heuristic
and other cognitive errors (see Tables 5.3-­5.5) and use the diagnostic time-­out (see Table 5.6) when a diagnosis does not fit the clinical
presentation.
Population health strategies have the advantage of addressing the determinants of disparities at both the clinic and community levels. Techniques such as hotspotting, cold-­casing (finding

patients and families lost to follow-­up and not receiving care), and
geocoding; collaborating with communities and community-­based
organizations; and periodic community health needs assessments
identify the structural, systemic, environmental, and social factors
that contribute to disparities and help guide interventions that are
tailored to the local setting.
Health disparities are a consequence of social and structural determinants of health that often have developed based on historically racist policies and other practices and traditions that led to the social
stratification mechanisms inherent in many modern societies. Health
disparities mirror other societal disparities in education, policing,
employment opportunities, and living conditions. While society grapples with the broader issues contributing to disparities, healthcare and
public health can work to understand the multiple causes of these disparities and develop interventions that address the structural, clinical,
and social root causes of these inequities.

2.1 Racism and Child Health
Mary T. Bassett, Zinzi D. Bailey, and Aletha Maybank

RACISM AS A SOCIAL DETERMINANT OF HEALTH
AND HEALTH INEQUITIES

An emerging body of evidence supports the role of racism in a range
of adverse physical, behavioral, developmental, and mental health outcomes. Racial/ethnic inequity in health outcomes in the United States
is long-­standing, apparent from the first collection of vital statistics in
the colonial period. However, the extensive data that document racial
disparities have not settled the question of why groups of people, particularly of African and Indigenous Nations peoples ancestry, face
increased odds of shorter lives and poorer health (see Tables 2.1, 2.2,
and 2.3). The role of societal factors is well recognized in determining
population health, but often omits racism among social determinants
of health. This oversight occurs in the face of a long history of racial
and ethnic subjugation in the United States that has been justified
both explicitly and implicitly by racism. From the early 18th century,
colonial America established racial categories that enshrined White
supremacy, conferring rights specifically on White men, while denying these rights to others. This “racial” designation was social and not
based on genetics. Similar, perhaps less explicit, discrimination has
continued through the centuries and remains a primary contributor to
racial/ethnic inequities in children’s health. Current lifelong exposure
to interpersonal, structural, and institutional racial discrimination and
subordination has a significant impact on Black health outcomes.
For generations, racial/ethnic disparities have been documented
beginning at birth and extending across life. In 2018, life expectancy
at birth for Blacks was almost 4 years shorter than life expectancy of
non-­
Hispanic Whites, influenced heavily by disparities starting at
birth (Table 2.3). The infant mortality rate (IMR), arguably the most
important measure of national health, has shown a persistent BlackWhite gap despite a substantial decline in U.S. IMR for all racial/ethnic groups (see Fig. 2.5). NCHS data in 2022 showed a double-­digit
IMR only among non-­Hispanic Blacks, with 10.38 deaths per 1,000 live
births, compared to 4.4/1,000 for non-­Hispanic Whites. A troubling
stagnation in IMR, with no recent decline, is found among Alaska
Natives and Indigenous Nations peoples. The 2022 IMR among non-­
Hispanic Indigenous Nation peoples or Alaskan Native individuals,
7.68 deaths/1,000 live births, has remained essentially unchanged for
almost 2 decades.
Exposures that affect infant survival occur before birth. Much of
the maternal and child health literature emphasizes a higher prevalence of maternal obesity, diabetes, and substance/alcohol use before
conception among Black women as individualized risk factors leading
to disparities in birth outcomes (Chapter 114.1). A California study
of maternal obesity found that 22.3% of pregnant Black women and

20.3% of Latina women had a body mass index (BMI) of 30-­40, compared with 14.9% of White and 5.6% of Asian women. BMI >40 was
more than twice as prevalent in Black (5.7%) than in White (2.6%)
women. Further, in a nationally representative study of over 7 million
singleton live births from the 2016 and 2017 U.S. National Vital Statistics System, although maternal prepregnancy obesity was associated
with the risk of preterm birth in the general population, risk varied
by maternal age and race/ethnicity. Maternal obesity among non-­
Hispanic Black women was inversely associated with risk of preterm
birth among those younger than 30 years, but positively associated
among those age 30 and older. Similar relationships were shown for
non-­Hispanic White and Hispanic women. Although individual risk
factors such as obesity contribute to differences in birth and health outcomes, individual risk factors alone do not sufficiently explain these
differences. Further, a focus on individual risk factors may contribute
to a narrative that places blame on the individual without acknowledging the structural and social conditions of patients’ lives influencing
the prevalence of these risk factors. Proximal factors such as maternal
obesity do not capture the root causes of early childhood health inequities, social determinants of health, which present intervention points
for achieving health equity.
Achieving health equity requires examining equity in outcomes and
also equity in process. Causes and interventions to address health inequities can be conceptualized as occurring upstream, downstream, or
somewhere in between (Fig. 2.7). Downstream determinants occur on
individual levels, including individual biology and specific risk factors
and behaviors. In Figure 2.7, measures of health and health inequities,
like life expectancy, IMR, maternal obesity, and maternal age, are at
the far right and are considered downstream factors. Clinical interventions focused on downstream factors may help individuals, but do
not address factors upstream that drive inequities in population health
outcomes.
These upstream factors include the physical, social, work, and service
environments in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age that
lead to downstream outcomes. If a child lives in public housing that is
systematically underresourced to eliminate common pests, that child
is more likely to encounter asthma triggers, experience asthma attacks,
and require emergency department care or hospitalization. Interventions could include remediating one apartment or home or increasing
access to insurance; however, this is not getting at systematic mechanisms by which public housing becomes a social determinant of health.
Moreover, these interventions do not address the reasons that families
need public housing in the first place or why these living conditions
are more prevalent among certain communities compared with others.
The distribution of these living conditions is patterned by institutional inequities in the public and private sectors and in our laws and
regulations, which represent a wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life. Social inequities, like racism, sexism,
classism, heterosexism, and ableism, represent upstream social determinants of health that affect access to resources and healthy living conditions and are inequitably distributed across preexisting hierarchies
of power. Resource allocation for public housing and the absence of
universal access to a living wage might drive the living conditions
within public housing. Focusing solely on downstream results of larger
inequitable structures seldom yields sustainable change and ignores the
roots of health inequities while tending to blame individuals structurally constrained by centuries of inequitable systems.
Prenatal maternal exposures to pesticides, lead, and other environmental toxins vary by race. This inequitable distribution is largely
driven by racist policies and practices affecting exposures to small-­and
large-­scale environmental hazards (see Chapter 2). The effects of persistent racism are stressful and toxic to the body, with the experience
of discrimination across leading to biologic changes that persist the life
span, especially for pregnant women and their children. Thus racism
is an essential social determinant of racial/ethnic inequities in maternal and child health. Racism can increase cortisol levels and lead to a
cascade of effects, including impaired cell function, altered fat metabolism, increased blood glucose and blood pressure, and decreased bone
formation (see Chapter 1 and Fig. 2.3). This can affect a growing fetus,

leading to increased infant cortisol levels, lower birthweight (LBW),

adverse birth outcomes: 1.3% had preeclampsia, less than half the rate
for Black women (2.9%).
Although infant deaths occur more frequently among low-­income
groups of all races/ethnicities, these birth outcome disparities by
race/ethnicity are found also in Blacks with higher SES. College-­
educated Black women are more likely than White high school–educated women to have a LBW infant, a principal risk factor for infant

death. Another study examined California birth certificates of pregnant Arab American women after the September 11, 2001, terrorist
attacks and found that those who experienced discrimination immediately after the 9/11 attacks had a higher relative risk of giving birth
to an LBW infant in the following 6 months than seen in births before
this date. A similar association between exposures to discrimination-­
based violence and Latina mothers giving birth to LBW infants was
found after the largest federal immigration incident in U.S. history in
Postville, Iowa, with infants having a 24% greater risk at being LBW

∗ Upstream refers to acknowledging and addressing the structural, societal, community and individual-level factors that influence health. Whereas downstream
refers to the dominant approach of treating individual-level factors and/or contributors without wholly addressing structural, societal, and community factors.

at birth. These findings reinforce the critical role the physician has
in explicitly asking families about potential exposures to racialized
stressors and trauma.
The increased risk of disease for populations of color continues
from infancy into childhood (see Table 2.1); racial/ethnic disparities are seen across almost all health indicators, with most relative
gaps remaining stagnant or worsening over the past two decades.
Compared with White children, Black children are about twice as
likely to be diagnosed with asthma, more likely to be hospitalized
for its treatment, and more likely to have fatal attacks. The BlackWhite disparity in asthma has grown steadily over time. Indigenous
Nations children and youth (≤19 years) also experience negative
health outcomes, with the highest rates of unintentional injury
and mortality rates at least twice as high as for other racial/ethnic
groups. Additionally, according to a 2017 NCHS brief, Latino youth
age 2-­19 have the highest rates of obesity in the 2000 CDC sex-­/age-­
specific growth charts. The NCHS data show that 25.8% of Latino
(followed by Black) children qualified as obese from 2015 to 2016.
Black children are more likely to be exposed to witnessed, personal,
or family violence (an example of an adverse childhood experience), and exposure to these stressful life experiences is associated
with academic, behavioral, and health problems. Notably, children
with more stressful life experiences have a higher likelihood of
experiencing ear infections, acute respiratory infections, obesity,
eczema, viral infections, and teen pregnancy.

EXPLAINING RACIAL DISPARITIES: A TAXONOMY
OF RACISM

Explanations of these ubiquitous racial gaps have focused on individual factors, including variation in individual genetic constitution, behavioral risks, poverty, and access to (and use of) healthcare

services. Scientists agree that “race” is a social construct that is not
based on biology, despite the persistence of the idea that racial categories reflect a racially distinctive genetic makeup that has a bearing
on health. In fact, the genetic variation between individuals within
a particular racial/ethnic group is far greater than the variability
between “races.” Further, biologic ancestry is distinct and separate
from the social construct of race. Despite the genetic data, many
groups have been “racialized” over time. Notably, the U.S. Census
Bureau’s demographic classifications reflect this process. In the mid-­
to-­late 1800s the census counted “mulattos,” those of White and Black
ancestry, as another race.
Starting in the late 19th century, Eastern European immigrants
and Jews were considered different races. As early as 1961, the U.S.
Census identified Mexicans and Puerto Ricans as “White” even as
racial classification varied by geography. All states collected birth
records by 1919, but there was little uniformity on how race was collected, if at all, across states. It was not until 1989, when the National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) recommended assigning
“infant race” as that of the mother and that standard guidance and
categories were issued for states on collecting racial data at birth.
Existing categories were changed and continue to change based on
the economic, cultural, or political utility of the time, rather than
actual genetic distinction.

Defining Racism

Racism has consistently structured U.S. society and is based on
“White supremacy,” a hierarchical idea that Whites, the dominant
group, are intrinsically superior to other groups who are not classified as “White” No single definition of racism exists, but one useful
description is racial prejudice backed by power and resources. This
conceptualization asserts that not only must there be prejudice but

also an interlocking system of institutions to produce and reproduce
inequities in access to and use of resources and decision-­making
power. Even when considering variations in health behavior, lifestyles, economic status, and healthcare use, individual-­level behavioral factors do not capture how broader shared social experiences
shape outcomes. Racial domination or racism contributes to variation in the population’s access to resources and exposure to disease
and to the group experience of fair treatment and opportunity.
Although many groups in the United States may encounter discrimination based on race/ethnicity, most of the modest literature on
health effects of racism has focused on people of African descent,
leaving a need to better understand the impact of racism on people
of color. Table 2.4 and Figure 2.3 describe various pathways through
which racism affects health.
Although the empirical data on disparities for non-­Black populations of color deserve greater research, useful frameworks exist to
understand the disparities that public health has documented to date.
A useful taxonomy of how racism operates in society has four categories: internalized racism, interpersonal racism, institutional racism,
and structural racism. Each is relevant in considering the impact of
racism on child health.

Internalized Racism

When the larger society characterizes marginalized racialized
groups as “inferior,” these negative assessments may be accepted by
members of those groups themselves, either consciously or unconsciously. The result is devaluation of personal abilities and intrinsic
worth, in addition to the capacity, of others also classified as being
a part of a marginalized racialized group. The best-­known documentation of internalized racism comes from the study of Kenneth
and Mamie Clark known as the doll experiment, conducted in the
1940s. Black children, both males and females, were asked to choose
between a Black doll and a White doll according to attributes
described by the interviewer. In response to positive attributes (e.g.,
pretty, good, smart), most children chose the White doll. The Clarks
interpreted this finding to mean that Black children had internalized the societal views of Black inferiority and White superiority,
even at the expense of their personal self-­image. Repeated by a New
York City high school student several decades later, the findings
were much the same, with 15 of 21 children endorsing positive attributes to light-­skinned dolls. Multiple studies confirm that racial
identity is established in young children, both Black and White,
along with negative views of blackness. Developmentally, however,
youth of color often explore racial identity earlier than their White
counterparts. In terms of health outcomes, depending on perceived
inferiority or superiority of the group, racial identification is associated with self-­esteem, mastery, and depressive symptoms. Low self-­
esteem is independently implicated in mental health disorders and
may contribute to the phenomenon of stereotype threat, in which
personal expectation of underperformance correlates with prevailing
social stereotypes and adversely affects actual performance.

Interpersonal Racism

How racial beliefs affect interactions between individuals has been
the most-­studied aspect of racism. Interpersonal racism refers to
situations where one person from society’s privileged racial group
acts in a discriminatory manner that adversely affects another person or group of people. Such actions may be based on explicit beliefs
or on implicit beliefs of which the perpetrating individual is not
consciously aware. The experience of unfair and prejudicial treatment has biologic consequences, reflected in measurable increases
in stress responses.
Such effects of interpersonal racism are best documented for
mental health, where perceived unfair treatment serves as psychosocial stressors, and are less robust for physical health outcomes.
A 2021 study of 10,354 U.S. children age 10 and 11 years found
only 2.8% of Whites, 5.4% of Latinos, 6.2% of Asian and Pacific
Islanders, 6.5% of Indigenous Nations peoples, and 10% of Blacks
self-­
reported enduring racial discrimination. Furthermore, discriminatory experiences have been strongly and consistently linked
to greater risk for anxiety, depression, conduct disorder, psychologic distress, ADHD, ODD, low self-­esteem or self-­worth, and
challenges to psychologic adaptation and adjustment (see Chapter 2). Perceived racial discrimination can affect behavioral, mental, and physical health outcomes and is associated with increased
alcohol and drug use among Indigenous Nations peoples (age 9-­16
years), increased tobacco smoking for Black youth (11-­19 years),
higher depressive symptoms among Puerto Rican children, and
insulin resistance among young females.
Understanding the enduring impact of childhood experience on
adult health has increased with the study of ACEs (see Chapter 1).
ACEs have well-­documented cumulative negative health effects that
occur across the life span and are patterned by race/ethnicity. Early
experience of racism is a proxy measure for toxic stress. The question, “Was [child’s name] ever treated or judged unfairly because of
their race or ethnic group?” is included in the U.S. Census Bureau’s
NSCH, a random sample of over 90,000 households to assess the

health of children up to 17 years old. Children of color from low-­
income households, especially Latino children, were reported to
have the lowest level of health. However, higher SES did not protect children exposed to racism from experiencing relatively poorer
health. Children exposed to racism were also more likely (by 3.2%)
to have a diagnosis of ADHD and were 2 times more likely to experience anxiety and depression.
Toxic stress increases cortisol levels in the body, increasing the risk
of chronic disease. One study revealed that adolescents who reported
average or high levels of perceived discrimination experienced exaggerated cortisol output in response to negative affect, whereas those
reporting low levels of perceived discrimination did not experience
significant reactivity to negative affect, after controlling for other
stressors. Adolescents who experience racism with no support have
been shown to have higher levels of blood pressure and obesity than
those with emotional support, which can be protective.
Medical practice has not been exempted from occurrences of
interpersonal racism. Using variation in adherence to established
clinical standards in diagnostic and treatment decisions across
racialized groups, researchers have been assessing interpersonal
racism in physician-­patient interactions. The most comprehensive
review of such bias in clinical care remains the study by the U.S.
Institute of Medicine, in which the discriminatory treatment was
inferred from examination of clinical decision-­making rather than
from directly observed interactions. For virtually every condition
studied, Black patients were less likely to receive recommended
care. Such racial bias has been most extensively established in adults
but also extends to children. A study conducted in an emergency
department found pediatric patients (<21 years) were less likely
to receive medically indicated pain medication if they were Black,
mirroring the historical misconception of reduced pain sensitivity
among Blacks. Within this context, it is unsurprising that perceived
interpersonal racism has been linked to healthcare use, including delays in seeking care or filling prescriptions and distrust of
the health system. When Black patients receive concordant care
from Black healthcare providers, their communications, health
outcomes, and care are improved when compared with care from
White providers.
Perceived and experienced discrimination can be measured by
at least six instruments (scales). Questions such as “Are you treated
with less respect or courtesy than other people,” “Do people act as
if they are afraid of you,” “Do people act as if they think you are
not smart,” and “Do you receive poorer service than other people,”
can be quantified with responses that range from Almost everyday
to Never. High scores have been associated with preterm birth (see
Chapter 114.1)

Institutional Racism

Interpersonal racism clearly inflicts harms, but even if completely
eliminated, racial inequities would persist because of institutional
and structural racism. Broadly, institutional racism refers to patterns
of discrimination based on policy, culture, or practice and carried

out by state and nonstate institutions (e.g., corporations, universities, legal systems, cultural institutions) within various sectors (e.g.,
housing, education, criminal justice). Key to current residential
segregation are banking practices dating to the post-­Depression era.
As an institution, the education system has been another tragic case
of how racism affects children’s health. In addition, mass incarceration by the criminal justice system has dramatically increased in
the United States while remaining relatively flat in other developed
countries (Fig. 2.8). Over a lifetime, approximately 30% of Black
men have been imprisoned.
In school, children of color can experience not only individual
racism but also institutional racism, as documented by higher rates
of disciplinary actions such as suspensions, and at younger ages
than White children. According to a 2016 U.S. Department of Education civil rights survey, Black children, who represent only 19%
of national preschool students, account for a staggering 47% of out-­
of-­school suspensions. Black preschoolers are 3.6 times more likely
to be suspended than their White peers. Black females, representing
20% of the female preschool population, account for 54% of out-­of-­
school suspensions. Many schools have a “zero tolerance” policy for
childhood behaviors, which criminalizes minor school infractions.
Unfortunately, this disparity persists as children continue
through the school system: for kindergarten to grade 12 (K-­12)
students, Black children are 3.8 times more likely to face out-­of-­
school suspension than White peers. This inequity is particularly
harmful because the educational system feeds into the criminal justice system (school to prison pipeline). Black students are 2.2 times
more likely to have either school-­related arrests or law enforcement
referrals than their White peers. The U.S. Department of Education
survey also reveals racial inequities among children with disabilities. For K-­12 children with disabilities covered under the Individuals with Disability Education Act, 21% of multiracial females were
issued at least one out-­of-­school suspension, compared with 5% of
White females.
Racial disparities in school discipline for minor infractions, disruptive behavior, or disobedience is linked to the concept of adultification. In this harmful, often unrecognized racial bias and social
stereotype, adults and especially police view Black children (as young
as 5-10 year) as older, less innocent, and more culpable than White
students of the same age. Black male children are perceived as older,
bigger, and more physically threatening than White peers. Black female
children are viewed with similar characteristics plus a perception that
Black female youth need less nurturing or protection, are more independent, and less innocent.
In addition to the threat to educational and employment prospects,
school suspensions also affect children’s health. A 2016 brief from the
Yale Child Study Center states that early suspensions and expulsions of
children harm behavioral and social-­emotional development, weakening a child’s overall development. Furthermore, these forms of punishment may prevent the treatment of underlying health issues, such as
mental health issues or disabilities, and cause increased stress for the
entire family.

Chapter 2 u Child Health Disparities 21
Institutional racism can function without apparent individual
involvement and has powerful repercussions that persist centuries
later. Both medical professional organizations and educational institutions have legacies of racial discrimination rooted in scientific racism.
In 2008 the American Medical Association (AMA) issued a formal
apology for its long history, dating to the 1870s, of endorsing explicitly
racist practices, including exclusion of Black physicians, silence on civil
rights, and refusal to make any public statement on federally sponsored
hospital segregation. In 2020, the American Academy of Pediatrics’
(AAP) board of directors published an acknowledgement and apology, Truth, Reconciliation, and Transformation: Continuing on the Path
for Equity, for the institutionalized racist and exclusionary treatment
of two Black physicians, Drs. Alonzo deGrate Smith and Roland Boyd
Scott, dating back to 1939 and spanning until 1945 when they were
finally admitted to the AAP as the first Black members. Exclusion from
medical associations also meant exclusion from gaining privileges to
work at the majority of hospitals. Despite a focus on medical school
desegregation in the 1960s and 1970s, the presence of Black students
in medical schools is actually declining. Low enrollment has become
especially critical for Black men, who in 2014 accounted for about 500
of the 20,000 medical students nationwide. If physicians hold stereotyped views about race that affect their clinical decision-­making, the
declining diversity of medical student bodies may well have consequences for the quality of medical care. This history of institutional
racism on people of color contributes to the mistrust, apprehension,
and fear projected toward the entire medical establishment.

Structural Racism

The institutional racism within medical institutions reinforces institutional racism in other sectors, creating a larger system of discrimination, structural racism. Structural racism can be described as “the
totality of ways in which societies foster racial discrimination via mutually reinforcing systems of housing, education, employment, earnings,
benefits, credit, media, healthcare, and criminal justice. These patterns
and practices in turn reinforce discriminatory beliefs, values, and distribution of resources, which together affect risk of adverse health outcomes.” Institutional racism and structural racism are sometimes used
interchangeably, but structural racism refers to overarching patterns
beyond a single institution, or even a collection of institutions. Historically, government policies and practices have been largely responsible
for the creation of these structures.
De facto and de jure urban residential segregation serves as a case
study for how the mechanisms of structural racism operate across multiple sectors and can affect child health and development across the life
course. As described in Chapter 2 urban residential racial segregation
was reinforced by the practice of redlining initiated by the U.S. Federal Housing Administration in 1934. This now illegal (but still covert)
practice demarcated urban neighborhoods to be made ineligible for
home loans based primarily on the racial composition of the neighborhood. Thus Black neighborhoods were excluded from the federally financed, post-­Depression home ownership boom and remained
segregated. Through this segregation, existing resources were systematically removed (disinvestment) and led to further impoverished communities of color.
The effects of residential segregation were not restricted to the banking or housing sectors. Residential segregation ties together multiple
systems, driving children’s access to and quality of healthcare, education, and justice, as follows:
• Residential segregation and the healthcare system. Healthcare institutions were explicitly racially segregated by law and inequitably
resourced until passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Vestiges of this
segregation continue in hospital-­level segregation and racial composition by hospital. In addition, institutions that provide mainly
for uninsured or underserved residents are often financially unstable, leading to higher risk of closure in disinvested neighborhoods
of color. On the provider level, fewer primary care and specialty
physicians practice in disinvested, segregated neighborhoods, and

those who are present are less likely to participate in Medicaid.
• Residential segregation and the education system. Schools have a
similar history of racial segregation and, after a brief respite of integration peaking in 1980, the level of segregation now resembles pre–
civil rights levels. School segregation is related to high-­risk health
behaviors. Within these schools and in their neighborhoods, Black
children experience disproportionate penalization and criminalization in the educational and criminal justice systems, reinforcing institutional racism in other sectors and other forms of racism. A low-­
income Black child is much more likely than a low-­income White
child to live in a segregated neighborhood. The result is that the
Black child will face not only the cumulative disadvantage in both
family and neighborhood resources and experiences over time but
also the initiation of chains of disadvantage during sensitive periods
of childhood key for development and adult transition (e.g., early
childhood, adolescence).
• Residential segregation and the criminal justice system. Incarceration
is concentrated in overpoliced and criminalized Black communities.
In the NCHS, almost 13% of Black children had a parent imprisoned during their childhood (to age 17 years), compared with about
6% of White children. Parental incarceration—which may start with
a traumatic arrest in the home and later disrupt caregiving, create
social stigma, deepen financial disadvantage, disconnect parents
emotionally from children, and disrupt children’s psychologic development—has been independently associated with a higher risk of
children’s antisocial behavior.
Most notably, experiences directly related to institutional and structural racism, operating through residential segregation (including
financial hardship, parental imprisonment, and neighborhood violence), result in higher levels of ACEs for Blacks and Latinos than for
Whites. There has been growing, consistent evidence of the lifelong
association between ACEs and a range of negative physical and mental
health outcomes across the life course.
Structural racism, shown here with the example of residential segregation, affects child health through various direct and indirect, overlapping pathways, including the concentration of dilapidated housing,
inferior quality of the social and built environment, exposure to pollutants and toxins, limited access to high-­quality primary and secondary education, few well-­paying jobs, overpolicing and criminalization,
adverse experiences, and limited access to quality healthcare.

OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS RACISM

Racism as a determinant of health has strong empirical support, and
there is promising evidence for community-­wide approaches to its mitigation. Less is known about effective interventions in clinical settings.
Most medical schools and subsequent training will not have prepared
practitioners to examine the role of racism in their patients’ lives or
clinical care settings. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to expect that pediatricians can help address racism and promote racial justice in at least
three ways: during individual patient encounters and at their practice
sites, as members of institutions that provide medical care and training,
and as respected community members.

Clinical Settings

A first step in understanding that racism affects everyone is personally
assessing implicit bias. Such biases reflect reflexive patterns of thinking, often using racial stereotypes stemming from living in a racially
stratified society. The Project Implicit Race Implicit Association
Test (https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html) is available
online, and its results are confidential. The purpose of such tests is to
create awareness, not apportion blame. Nonetheless, results are usually jarring for all participants, no matter their racial identity, many of
whom will uncover negative racial biases of which they were unaware.
Such individual assessments may contribute to addressing interpersonal racism as it triggers self-­reflection. Further, a growing number
of organizations offer training in understanding common behaviors
associated with implicit bias, including microaggressions (see later)

22 Part I u The Field of Pediatrics
and inequitable hiring practices. Recognizing and undoing personal
biases as pediatricians requires training to challenge existing thought
processes and actions that are often difficult to see. Seeing and undoing
personal biases are lifelong endeavors, and progress should be tracked
over time.
Pediatricians and other health workers have an entrusted role
in families that requires a partnership. Recognizing the strengths of
families and valuing their lived experiences of internalized and interpersonal racism as expertise fosters a more collaborative clinical interaction and relationship. This expertise cannot be readily captured by
pedagogy or acquired by a pediatrician in training or clinical practice.
Such an approach emphasizes respect for the expertise that caregivers bring to raising their child and begins with the presumption that
caregivers want to do what is best for the child. By doing this, physicians can form a collaborative relationship, rather than one based on
racial stereotypes and blame. Cultural competence is a widespread
concept, recognizing that other cultures exist that the dominant culture
must learn to decode. In contrast, the concept of cultural humility,
for which training is increasingly available, considers equality among
cultures and a partnership approach to differences.
During clinical encounters with children and families, healthcare
workers can use their authority to acknowledge racism. Although there
is still a gap in evidence on how, when, and what, pediatricians can
consider having “The Talk” with their patients who are Black, young
adolescent, and male. “The Talk” is the conversation that Black parents
typically initiate with their children regarding interactions with police.
In doing so, the pediatrician affirms the need for such conversations
to promote safety and may provide opportunities to connect families
to community resources. For all young children and youth of color,
pediatricians should ask patients if they have they been treated unfairly
because of their race, recognizing this can be a form of bullying. The
experience of racism at all levels can be traumatic. Trauma consists of
experiences or situations that are emotionally painful and distressing
and that overwhelm people’s ability to cope, leaving them powerless.
Pediatricians must consider adopting trauma-­informed care practices
that shift the paradigm from, “What is wrong with you?” to “What has
happened to you?”
In addition, healthcare providers must strive for structural competency, which is the “trained ability to discern how a host of issues
defined clinically as symptoms, attitudes, or diseases also represent the
downstream implications of a number of upstream decisions,” according to Johnathan M. Metzl and Helena Hansen. Consequently, it is
helpful to ensure that clinical practices are aware of other social services that may enhance health and engagement with clinical care, such
as a need for legal counsel to address substandard housing, counter
landlord harassment, or negotiate threatened evictions (http://medical-­
legalpartnership.org/), or the support of literacy by prescribing or
distributing children’s books in order to encourage parents to read to
children (http://www.reachoutandread.org/).

Institutional Settings

The healthcare institution more broadly is also a setting where racial
dynamics occur. Introducing conversations about race may uncover
experiences that would not otherwise be apparent. A common outcome of implicit racial bias is microaggressions, actions and attitudes
that may seem trivial or unimportant to the perpetrators but create a
cumulative burden for those who perceive them. A physician of color
might be asked for identification on entering a hospital, whereas White
colleagues are not so queried. These microaggressions occur in interactions among staff and with patients and may contribute to an unspoken
and uncomfortable racial climate. Although such interactions rarely
would violate federal discrimination standards, interaction between
coworkers shapes an entire practice and can be perceived by families.
Encouraging institutions to assess the impact of race among
patients and staff is a first step. Healthcare delivery institutional settings can use both data and patient accounts to examine racial effects

in the practice and experience by routinely disaggregating assessment
measures by race/ethnicity. Patient-­
reported satisfaction or quality
of care might be disaggregated by race. In addition, it is important to
consider racial equity within the practice’s employment structure: Are
there discrepancies in hiring, retention, and salaries by race? Are there
proper supervision and grievance procedures, particularly around
issues related to racial microaggressions? Also, consider the images
and language used to discuss and represent both patients and staff, particularly when alluding to race/ethnicity. Organizations such as Race
Forward (https://www.raceforward.org) and organizational assessment
tools developed by the Race Matters Institute can help guide institutional assessments and internal change processes. Several local health
departments have already incorporated antiracism training into staff
professional development and introduced internal reforms to drive organizational change. Because institutional reform is closely associated with
other models of productive practices, including quality improvement,
collective impact, community engagement, and community mobilization, application of an antiracism lens should be judged by its contributions to organizational effectiveness and on its moral merits.
Education or training institutions have a special role in ensuring a
workforce that is both diverse and informed. Patterns of student admissions should be scrutinized, as should the curriculum. The recruitment
of Black healthcare workers will enhance the benefits of racially concordant care between Black providers and patients.
Although many medical schools now include diversity training
and provide instruction on cultural competency, such instruction is
often brief (and sometimes delivered online). By contrast, approaches
based on structural competency, cultural humility (see Chapter 12),
and cultural safety have been implemented in health professionals’ training in such countries as Canada and New Zealand. These
approaches emphasize the value of gaining knowledge about structural racism, internalized scripts of racial superiority and inferiority,
and the cultural and power contexts of health professionals and their
patients or clients. Health professionals benefit from the scholarship
of diverse disciplines about the origins and perpetuation of, and remedies to counter, racism. Finding class time for these topics encounters
a biomedical bias that is widespread in medical education, although
arguably successful medical practice also requires a host of skills in
addition to a firm grounding in pathophysiology and recommended
treatments. Racism results in damaging disparities that cause ill health
and shorten lives, which justifies the teaching hours committed to its
understanding.

Pediatricians as Advocates for Antiracist Practices
and Systems

Physicians are respected members of communities and wield the
power, privilege, and responsibility for dismantling structural racism.
A conceptual review of structural racism highlights the promise of
place-­based interventions that target geographically defined communities, to engage residents and a range of institutions (across sectors) in
order to ensure equitable access to resources and services, remediating
the processes set in motion decades earlier. Clinicians play a role in
advocating with the halls of medicine in linking patients to services,
programming, and other resources and advocating for responsiveness
in addressing gaps. Over time, concentrated efforts across sectors in
targeted areas have shown improvement in a host of social outcomes,
including health outcomes. Similarly, providing access to higher-­
quality housing, either with housing vouchers or housing lotteries, had
unexpected positive health impacts. These findings are encouraging,
as are the social policy interventions and systemic change, including
legislation such as the Civil Rights Act, the advent of Medicare and
Medicaid, and tenement regulations, associated with the narrowing of
racial gaps.

GLOBAL BURDEN AND TRENDS IN CHILD HEALTH

The under-­5 mortality rate (U5MR), also known as the child mortality rate, serves as a reliable gauge of child well-­being. It measures
the outcome of a country’s health system and reflects a nation’s
social and economic development. The global U5MR fell by 61%
between the years 1990 and 2020. Despite these gains, in 2019 an
estimated 5.3 million children under 5 years of age died worldwide,
which is equivalent to 37.1 deaths per 1,000 live births, or nearly
13,700 child deaths each day. The burden of the world’s child mortality disproportionately falls upon low-­and middle-­income populations of Africa and Asia (Fig. 3.1), with 82% of all child deaths in
the world occurring in just two regions: sub-­Saharan Africa (55%)
and South Asia (27%), compared to the less than 1% of child deaths
occurring in high-­income countries (HICs). Consequently, a child
born in sub-­Saharan Africa is over 15 times more likely to die by age
5 years compared to a child born in an HIC.
Improvements in child mortality have been uneven globally,
regionally, and nationally. Significant disparities in child mortality persist and are concentrated in specific regions of Africa and
Asia. The countries with the highest child mortality gap between
the richest and the poorest in 2019 were Nigeria, Guinea, and the
Central African Republic. In Nigeria in 2019 while the national rate
of child mortality was 117 deaths per 1,000 live births, at the subnational level, the rates ranged from 58 to 261 deaths per 1,000 live
births.
Although the number of child deaths has decreased dramatically
over the past 3 decades, the early years of life remain one of a child’s

most vulnerable periods. Among the under-­5 child deaths, nearly
half occurred within their first month of life (2.4 million deaths in
2019). This estimate of neonatal deaths (<1 month of age) translates into 17.9 per 1,000 live births. Declines in neonatal mortality
occurred at slower rates, so that in 2019 the neonatal deaths made
up 48% of all under-­5 deaths (Fig. 3.2).
Neonatal deaths account for a smaller percentage of child mortality in low-­and middle-­income countries (LMICs) compared to
HICs (Fig. 3.3), but the absolute risk of death remains significantly
higher. A child in sub-­Saharan Africa or in Southern Asia is nine
times more likely to die in the first month of life than a child born
in an HIC.
An estimated 2 million stillborn deaths (≥28 completed weeks’
gestation) burden families worldwide every year, which correlates
to 13.9 deaths per 1,000 births. This translates into a stillborn baby

stillbirth rates. Progress to reduce stillbirths has been slow, with
the annual rate of reduction estimated to be half that for neonatal deaths between 2000 and 2019. Almost all stillbirths occur in
LMICs (98%), with three-­quarters in sub-­Saharan Africa and South
Asia.
Most childhood deaths are caused by conditions that could be
prevented or managed through improved access to simple, low-­cost
interventions. The most common causes of child death are preterm birth complications, intrapartum-­related events, pneumonia,
and diarrhea (Fig. 3.4). Of all under-­5 child deaths, 2.61 million
were the result of infectious diseases and 21.7% of all child deaths
were vaccine-­preventable. Neonatal disorders accounted for an
estimated 46% of the deaths in children younger than the age of 5
years. In contrast, child deaths from infections in developed countries are less common, where injuries and congenital malformations
account for higher proportions of under-­5 deaths. Undernutrition,
including fetal growth restriction, stunting and wasting, and micronutrient deficiencies, contributes up to 45% of under-­5 deaths and
poor childhood development in LMICs. Undernutrition has an
enormous impact on child mortality because of the vicious cycle
between nutrition and infection whereby lowered immunity and
mucosal damage from inadequate dietary intake lead to increased
susceptibility to pathogen invasion, while recurrent illnesses impair
the child’s appetite and ability to absorb adequate calories and nutrients. In addition, undernutrition early in life can have long-­lasting
consequences, including impaired cognitive ability and reduced
school and work performance.

of death, contributing 60–80% of all neonatal deaths. Most of these

Chapter 3 u Global Child Health
infants are premature (born before 37 weeks of pregnancy) or suffered from fetal growth restriction. About half of stillbirths take
place during labor, ranging from 10% in developed regions to 59.3%
in South Asia, which reflects the role that timely, high-­quality care
around delivery can play to prevent many deaths.
Mortality among older children age 5-­14 is low compared with the
younger cohort, although 1 million children in this age group died in
2016, which is equivalent to 3,000 children dying every day. Infectious
diseases play a smaller role in deaths among these older children, with
injuries from causes such as drowning and road traffic trauma accounting for more than a quarter of the deaths and noncommunicable diseases for about another quarter.
Child health should not be assessed based on mortality rates alone.
Children surviving illness are often left with lifelong disabilities,
burdening their families and affecting their economic productivity.
Approximately 1 in 10 children are born with or acquire a disability,
and 80% of these disabled children live in LMICs. Neonatal disorders, infectious diseases, protein-­energy and micronutrient deficiencies, hemoglobinopathies, and injuries are leading causes of disability
in children. Child deaths can also lead to disability in the surviving
mother. For example, a woman who has a stillbirth is at risk of an
obstetric fistula or death, with an estimated 78–98% of women with
obstetric fistula having had a stillbirth. Also, perinatal loss and child
death is a psychologic trauma. Stillbirth, neonatal death, and child loss
can lead to posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, guilt, and
in some settings shame and social stigma, particularly in the mother,
with significant impact on the health and well-­being of the family.
Adolescents age 10-­19 years who have benefited from the gains
in child survival grow up to find themselves in social settings where
less attention and fewer resources are devoted to their well-­being
compared to their earlier years of growth. The paucity of support
during this time of transition into adulthood diminishes the impact
that child survival can have on their lives. Adolescents made up 18%
of the world’s population, approximately 1.8 billion individuals, in
2010, and the adolescent population is expected to increase to over 2
billion in the year 2050. The vast majority of adolescents, 88%, live
in LMICs. In 2050, sub-­Saharan Africa is projected to have more
adolescents than any other region. Although adolescent mortality
rates are far lower than their younger age cohorts, in low-­income
countries adolescents face a lack of educational and employment
opportunities and increased risk of injuries and violence, HIV and
AIDS, mental health problems, adolescent marriage, and teenage
pregnancy—preventing them from attaining their potential as they
transition into adulthood. The decade of adolescence is a critical
period when poverty and inequity frequently transfer to the next
generation. The intergenerational transmission of poverty is most
apparent among undereducated adolescent females. In many parts of
the world poor teenage females are likely to be married early, risking premature childbearing, higher rates of maternal mortality, and
contributing to infant and child undernutrition.

THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF CHILD HEALTH
AND THE COVID-­19 PANDEMIC

The gross national income level accounts for much of the differences in
child mortality rates observed between countries; however, other significant factors affect child health. For example, although the wealth
of the United States places it in the 7th position with respect to gross
domestic product (GDP) per capita (2022) in the world, the U.S. child
mortality rate is ranked 47th in the world, at 6.5 deaths out of 1,000 live
births, which is higher than Cuba (5.1), Canada (4.9), the UK (4.3), the
Czech Republic (3.2), and Japan (2.5). In addition, national estimates of
mortality mask differences in health status among subpopulations within
the same country. In Burkina Faso, the child mortality rate is 43.7 per
1,000 live births among children born to mothers with no education,
whereas it is 16.7 per 1,000 among children born to mothers with at
least secondary education. Similarly, in 2016 the child mortality rate in
Bolivia was 18.6 per 1,000 live births for children in the highest wealth
quintile, whereas it was 55.1 per 1,000 for children living in the lowest
quintile.
Child health is influenced by socioeconomic factors that operate
at multiple levels of society. Disparities in these socioeconomic factors translate into child health inequities as reflected by high rates of
disease, poor nutrition, and disability. The immediate, underlying,
and basic structural determinants of disease, malnutrition, and disability are outlined in Figure 3.5. Preventive and curative medical
interventions focus on the immediate causes of poor health; however, inequities in child mortality and morbidity will persist unless
the basic and underlying determinants of health are addressed.

Socioeconomic and Political Roots of Disparities in
Global Health

The root influences on a child’s health often lie in the economic
and political environments in which the child is born (see Figs.
3.4 and 3.5). Growth of economies during the first half of the 20th
century was associated with dramatic health improvements, with
falling mortality rates and rising life expectancy across all regions.
However, the second half of the 20th century was characterized by
growing disparities in global economies and health between and
within many countries. According to the World Inequality Report
(http://wir2018.wid.world/) between 1980 and 2016 the richest 1% of the world reaped twice as much of the world’s income
as the poorest 50% of the world (27% of income growth compared
with 12%). Although almost all countries report population-­level
income inequalities, a few such as the United States have seen
income disparities at historical proportions. For example, since
1980 the bottom half of Americans captured only 3% of the total
growth. Growing income inequalities translate into greater differences in health outcomes, such as life expectancy, between the rich
and poor in the United States (Fig. 3.6). More aggressive redistribution of wealth through taxes and transfers, labor protections, and

universal access to education and health care contribute to Europe’s
significantly lower levels of income disparities.
Evidence supports the notion that inequalities are not just a
human rights issue, but are detrimental to economic growth.
Wealthier households spend a smaller percentage of their own
income, thereby dampening demand and slowing down economies. Poorer households face greater challenges to invest in health
and educational opportunities, translating into less human capital
and obstacles to be productive and contribute to the economy. In
extreme cases, inequalities can threaten social unrest, which further
undermines economic activity.
Global disparities have grown between many wealthy and low-­
income countries, in large part because of austerity measures, including structural adjustment programs, imposed on many postcolonial
countries by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World
Bank. To receive loans and pay off their debt, many of these countries
were required to take on austerity measures that transformed their
economies to produce cash crops and export natural resources to
HICs, rather than supporting local industries and investing in human
capital and social services. The focus on cash economies rather than

health and social service systems limited their ability to provide
services to their growing poor population and further hindered
responses to the spread of communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS
and the growing prevalence of noncommunicable diseases.

The COVID-­19 Pandemic

The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus­2 (SARS-­CoV-­2) leading to the global pandemic of coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-­19) resulted in over 6 million deaths from COVID-­19 and
over 499 million cases of COVID-­19 infection in the world (see Chapter
311). Children and adolescents tend to experience less severe illness and
fewer deaths from SARS-­CoV-­2 compared to adults, which may lead to
lower rates of testing among children and contribute to transmission.
Childhood COVID-­19 infections have not affected countries equally,
with early evidence showing pediatric deaths from COVID-­19 to be
significantly greater in LMICs compared to HICs. One study estimated
2.77 pediatric deaths/1 million children in LMICs compared to 1.32/
million children in HICs and higher rates of death among infants <1
year of age, at 0.07%, in HICs versus 1.30% in LMICs. Although some
LMICs’ settings are protected from COVID-­19 infection by having a
younger demographic profile, lower prevalence of the chronic conditions predisposing to severe infection, and less international transport
especially in remote, low-­income regions, they also suffer from limited
personal protective equipment, poor ventilation of indoor spaces, and
inequitable distribution of COVID-­19 vaccines. Marginalized groups
in these nations who are infected face inadequate medical support and
supplies, which can greatly elevate their risk of death and disability.
Furthermore, poor availability of testing leads to a large number of
deaths and infections being underreported.
The pandemic has significantly strained the already weak health
and public health systems in LMICs, raising grave concerns about the
risk for youth with chronic conditions. COVID-­19 impact has led to
disruptions in routine childhood vaccinations, lack of medical supplies, shortages of a health workforce, and reduced delivery of lifesaving services such as cardiac surgery. One estimate showed that 90% of
countries report disruptions in essential health services such as essential medicines, routine childhood immunizations, and diagnostics,
although some mitigation efforts are in place.

COVID-­19 and Social Determinants of Health

COVID-­19 affects child and adolescent health indirectly through
the rippling effects on the world’s economies and disruption of
national systems in public health, healthcare, food, and education,
all which are feared to be more of a threat than the pandemic itself
(Fig. 3.7).

Chapter 3 u Global Child Health
The economic crisis precipitated by the COVID pandemic lockdown and supply chain disruptions places the greatest strain on low-­
income communities, increasing the proportion of children who live in
extreme poverty and face housing instability. An estimated additional
100 million children are estimated to have fallen into extreme poverty
worldwide, which is the first increase in this indicator in 20 years. Preexisting disparities have widened during the pandemic both within
countries and globally between LMICs and HICs.
The COVID pandemic has stressed the social fabric of communities around the world so that the most marginalized and vulnerable bear
the brunt of its full impact. Many racial and ethnic minority groups are
unequally affected by COVID-­19, with significantly higher rates of illness
and death from COVID-­19. Vulnerable communities that existed before
the pandemic living in poverty, those employed in the informal sectors
(e.g., street vendors), living within close proximity to others, unable to
afford being able to stay safe at home, lacking protective gear at work, and
without access to healthcare and health insurance are all at greater risk for
COVID-­19 infections.
Children in LMICs are particularly vulnerable because of the prolonged shutdown of schools, resulting in loss of education without access
to technologic online solutions to engage in the educational curriculum.
The loss of safe school environments has also been attributed to further
widening gender inequities, and several countries reported a surge in
adolescent pregnancies, domestic violence, and child abuse after closures.
Furthermore, the number of children affected by COVID-­19–associated orphanhood and caregiver death has been estimated to have
increased by 90%. The loss of a mother is associated with increased
child mortality, especially when maternal death occurs in the first year
of the child’s life. In regions where rates of maternal death were already
high, the impact of COVID-­19 leading to loss of a mother or another
caregiver can have devastating impact on the lives of children in the
short and long term.

27

An epidemic of poor mental health has followed the COVID-­19 pandemic for parents and their children; as the pandemic has progressed,
the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among adolescents
has escalated. The impact on mental health is not surprising because
of the extraordinary disruption of routines, recreation, family income,
peer interaction, and school support. The pandemic further halted
mental health services in 93% of countries worldwide as the demand
for mental health services increased in settings where online mental
health services are not an option.

Sustainable Development Goals

The prioritization and planning of global development and international aid has been guided by international goals. In 2015, world leaders agreed to 17 goals, the Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs),
to improve global well-­being by 2030 (Fig. 3.8). The SDGs were built
on the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were
concrete, specific, and measurable targets set by the United Nations in
2000 to eradicate poverty, hunger, illiteracy, and disease by 2015.
The SDGs have become even more critical to countries planning
for ways to mitigate the future impact of the COVID-­19 pandemic
on child health, particularly among marginalized communities and
LMICs. The SDGs highlight recommended interventions for countries to meet their goals in the setting of the challenges created by the
COVID-­19 pandemic such as optimizing digital centers to increase
access to public services, with an emphasis on targeting solutions
for communities with low internet connectivity. There have been
setbacks in progress towards meeting the 17 SDGs because of the
COVID pandemic, highlighting the need to prioritize programs such
as routine immunization services, malaria bed net distribution, family planning, and antenatal care services to prevent further negative
impacts on child health.

SDG-­3 is to ensure healthy lives and promote well-­being for all at
all ages. It includes health-­related subtargets, including to reduce U5MR
to 25 deaths per 1,000 live births and neonatal mortality rate to 12 deaths
per 1,000 live births by 2030. The other 16 SDGs focus mainly on social
and economic determinants and the environment. This reflects an
important shift to broaden the global targets to include upstream determinants of health, including health systems, and socioeconomic, gender-­
based, political, and environmental factors. As a social movement to
support sustainable development, the SDGs were founded on the recognition that the world’s environment, economic and social development,
and human health are interconnected and dependent. The SDGs were
formulated with core principles and values for economic development,
environmental sustainability, and social inclusion for all.
The Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescent’s
Health 2016–2030 maps out the strategies to achieve the SDGs by centering on the goal of health for all women, children, and adolescents
using evidence-­based approaches, backed by innovative and sustainable financing mechanisms. An important component of the Global
Strategy is the inclusion of adolescents as central to the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development. In alignment with the SDGs, the Global
Strategy focuses on three pillars of action: (1) ending preventable
deaths among women, children, and adolescents, (2) ensuring their

health and well-­being by ending malnutrition and ensuring access to
family planning, reducing exposure to pollution, and achieving universal health coverage, and (3) expanding enabling environments
by efforts such as eradicating extreme poverty, ensuring good-­quality
education, eliminating violence against females, enhancing research
and technologic capabilities, and encouraging innovation.
In addition to being much broader in scope, the Global Strategy
focuses on equity in that the strategy is meant to apply to all people,
including the marginalized and difficult-­to-­reach populations, in all
situations, including during crisis. Health insurance coverage would
not be assessed based simply on the national average of coverage but
also by how well the increases in coverage benefit all population groups
regardless of income or educational level.

INNOVATIONS TO ADDRESS CHILD HEALTH

Estimates suggest that most of the 5.6 million annual deaths in children younger than 5 could be averted by increasing implementation of proven low-­cost interventions (Table 3.1). Childhood deaths
from diarrheal illness and pneumonia can be prevented by simple

measures such as vaccinations and exclusive breastfeeding until 6
months of age. Deaths related to undernutrition, which predisposes
children to infectious diseases, may be prevented by proper infant
and young child feeding practices, micronutrient supplementation,
and community-­based screening and management of malnutrition.
Addressing the SDGs to improve the health of mothers, children,
and adolescents takes a life-­course approach. Figure 3.9 displays estimates of coverage for essential interventions across the continuum of
care, indicating the wide range of coverage rates within countries that
will need to be addressed if SDGs are to be attained.

Vaccine-­Preventable Diseases

Vaccines prevent an estimated 2.5 million deaths per year among
children under 5 years of age. One study predicted a reduction in
120 million deaths among children born between 2000 and 2030
with vaccination programs. Yet in 2019 an estimated 1.15 million
under-­5 deaths were the result of vaccine-­preventable diseases, with
99% of these children who died living in LMICs. Top contributors
were Streptococcus pneumoniae and rotavirus, followed by Bordetella pertussis, measles virus, Haemophilus influenzae B (Hib), and
influenza virus.
The WHO Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) has
resulted in a dramatic reduction in deaths, illness, and disability
from many of these diseases, in addition to the near elimination
of poliomyelitis. Recommendations for routine immunizations
have continued to grow with the development of new vaccines that
have demonstrated significant lifesaving potential in industrialized
countries (Table 3.2). The vulnerability of these programs was demonstrated during the pandemic as global vaccine coverage dropped
from 86% in 2019 to 83% in 2020, with an estimated 23 million
under the age of 1 year who did not receive basic vaccines in 2020—
the highest number since 2009.
In 2015, 86% of the world’s infants were vaccinated with 3 doses
of DTP. Although vaccines are very effective in improving child survival, rates of coverage are low in many countries. In 2016, a total
of 19.5 million did not receive all routine lifesaving vaccinations,
and 90,000 deaths were reported due to measles alone. Lifesaving
vaccines are still not available in many countries, but progress has
been made to expand availability to new countries every year. The

lowest number of wild poliovirus cases were reported in 2016 (37
cases). The significant declines in immunization coverage caused by
the COVID-­19 pandemic have increased the risk for a resurgence
of these vaccine-­preventable infections amidst weakened healthcare
systems.

Reaching Every Child, Everywhere

Global vaccine organizations aim for universal coverage of immunizations but face challenges within countries to attain this goal.
Other lifesaving interventions have met barriers to attaining universal coverage. Oral rehydration therapy has been the evidence-­
based intervention to prevent dehydration from diarrheal disease
since the 1970s, yet only 2 in 5 children under 5 with diarrheal illness receive this treatment. The determinants of whether or not a
child receives a lifesaving intervention are multifactorial. Characteristics of a healthcare system, the social attitudes and practices,
and political climate affect whether universal coverage can be
reached for evidence-­based essential interventions. Innovations to
strengthen vaccine coverage to reach every child in every district
of a country range from programs such as Reaching Every Child
through Quality Improvement (REC-­QI), using community mapping techniques, to the integration of service delivery mechanisms
and strengthening the health system with improved surveillance.

Effective Delivery Strategies: Integrated Management
of Childhood Illness

Weak health systems impede the ability of countries to deliver cost-­
effective interventions and lifesaving health messages for children.
Such systems are characterized by insufficient numbers of health
workers, low-­quality training and supervision, and poorly functioning supply chains. The provision of child health services may focus
on a single level such as the health facility, but effective and lasting
improvements can only be achieved with the integration of delivery
at all levels, such as adequate referrals and follow-­up between community, clinic, and health facility. As countries resume health services after the COVID-­19 pandemic, an important component will be
community-­based, lifesaving outreach services such as mass immunization, vitamin A campaigns, and community-­based health promotion activities (Fig. 3.10).

visits for ill children. They also promote use of bed nets, handwashing, and proper infant and young child feeding. In 2003, the
IMCI guidelines underwent minor transitions, including the addition of newborn care under 1 week of age, so that it was renamed
Integrated Management of Newborn and Childhood Illnesses
(IMNCI).
Over 100 countries have adopted the IMNCI and implement
some or all of its components that include not only improving health
workers’ skills but also strengthening health systems and improving
family and community practices. After 20 years of implementation,
a recent review of the IMNCI strategy noted that it was associated
with a 15% reduction in child mortality when activities were properly implemented in health facilities and communities. However,
the implementation of IMNCI was found to be uneven between and
within countries. In many countries the resources for CHW training
and supervision, supply of medications, and referrals were limited
or absent. The IMNCI was only successful in those countries with
strong government leadership and a commitment to implement
IMNCI in partnership with support from groups such as UNICEF
and the WHO. The success of IMNCI required an adequate health
system and a systematic approach to planning and implementation.

Social Protection Programs: Conditional and
Unconditional Cash Transfers
Fig. 3.10 Health services delivery systems.

Community-­based interventions are effective in extending healthcare delivery, are low cost, improve healthcare-­seeking behavior, and
can reduce infant and child mortality and morbidity. They may include
community health workers (CHWs), who are members of a community without formal medical training chosen to provide basic health
and medical care to their community, as discussed in more detail later.
The lack of integration of programs that deliver individual interventions results in missed opportunities. Children may receive
immunizations from one health worker at one encounter, but go
somewhere else to obtain oral rehydration solution (ORS) for diarrheal illness and yet elsewhere for treatment of malnutrition. Past
programs focused on a single disease and set of interventions,
whereas most children present with overlapping signs and symptoms to community-­level health facilities with limited diagnostic
tools such as laboratories or radiography.
The Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI)
was launched in the mid-­1990s by UNICEF and the World Health
Organization (WHO) as an approach to reduce child death, illness, and disability and to promote improved growth and development in countries struggling with high child mortality rates. The
IMCI was designed to increase coverage of evidence-­based, high-­
impact interventions that tackle the top causes of child mortality by
integrating health promotion, illness prevention, and disease
treatment.
The IMCI contains both preventive and curative elements that
are set forth through a series of clinical algorithms and guidelines
for case management (Fig. 3.11 provides an example) and implemented by families, communities, and providers at health facilities. One key component of the IMCI strategy is to train CHWs to
use the algorithms to identify signs of common childhood illness
and to decide when a child needs referral to a health facility. IMCI
trains CHWs to instruct parents on home management of ill children, including ORS and zinc for diarrhea, antimalarial medicine
for febrile children who test positive for malaria, and antibiotics for
children with signs of pneumonia. CHWs can schedule follow-­up

Financial incentives are widely used to improve healthcare coverage, alleviate poverty, and improve access to child health services.
In industrialized countries, cash transfers are a common mechanism for ensuring that the poorest, most marginalized subgroups of
the population, particularly with children, receive adequate support
to meet their basic needs. Before the COVID-­19 pandemic, cash
transfer schemes were increasingly being used in LMICs to support
population needs, and COVID-­19 led to an enormous elevation of
social protection efforts as a critical response to mitigate the far-­
reaching impact of the pandemic on vulnerable communities. Many
lessons have been learned during this escalation of social protection
programs, which provides hope for continued support of families
in need, in addition to an expansion of services to mitigate the projected increases in children living in extreme poverty.
Out-­of-­pocket expenses by households form the major share of
total health expenditure in most LMICs. Many social protection
programs serve a dual purpose of reducing financial barriers and
strengthening service delivery. Financial incentives may include
cash transfers, microcredit, vouchers, and user fee removal and
health insurances. Financial incentive programs may be unconditional, provided to eligible families without any requirements
or expectations, based on the belief that families will use this
type of financial support for their children’s best interests. Other
incentives are conditional on health promotion behavior targeting child health, such as the provision of cash or vouchers only
to those families who participate in mother groups to learn about
breastfeeding practices, visiting clinics for child vaccinations and
growth monitoring, engaging in deworming, and ensuring that
their children receive vitamin A and iron supplementation. Some
social protection programs are also directed towards educational
improvement by making cash transfers conditional on child school
enrollment, attendance, and occasionally on some measure of academic performance.
Expansions of innovations that have been scaled up quickly during the pandemic protected millions of families such as through
mobile cash transfer programs that take advantage of data and
technology to better target those in need. Certain countries with
a large proportion of children at risk are projected to have a protracted recovery period. Efforts have been taken to identify and
provide international support for these countries and communities
(Fig. 3.12).

Adolescent health. The Global Strategy, which directs countries
to attain their SDGs, has called upon countries to focus efforts to
support adolescent health given the potential role in breaking the
intergenerational cycle of poverty. One challenge to attaining these
health goals will be to effectively advocate for governments to invest
in this age group as a means to improve national productivity and
the economy. Considerable gaps in data on adolescents pose one of
the biggest challenges to promoting their health and their rights.
Data on early adolescents age 10-­14 is relatively scarce, thus limiting the knowledge of this crucial period. Efforts to promote youth
participation in delineating their health priorities are essential to
the design of effective interventions.
One critical strategy to support adolescents is to improve completion
of secondary school education, particularly among girls. The development
of adolescents’ capacities and values through education can empower an
entire generation to become economically independent, to become positive contributors to society, and to break out of the cycle of poverty.

den of disease. Categorization into 3 groups according to
adolescent burden of disease and reflecting passage through

SM, Santelli JS, et al. Our future: A Lancet commission on adolescent health and wellbeing. Lancet. 2016;387:2423–2478,
Fig. 7.)

Other threats to adolescent health include mental health, substance abuse, sexual and reproductive health, and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as obesity, which vary depending on
country (Fig. 3.13). The surge in adolescent pregnancies that has
been reported in several countries during the COVID-­19 pandemic
places particular emphasis on the need to strengthen youth access
to sexual and reproductive education and services.
A common theme for these threats is that interventions to combat
these issues must attempt to influence individual behavior and attitudes while promoting healthy lifestyles. It is estimated that around
20% of the world’s adolescents have a mental health or behavioral
problem, and this has only increased since the COVID-­19 pandemic. Depression is the single largest contributor to the global
burden of disease for people age 15-­19, and suicide is one of the
three leading causes of mortality among people age 15-­35. Efforts
to tackle these problems will require an interdisciplinary approach,
with more research needed to identify and evaluate interventions to
effectively influence adolescent behavior in LMIC settings.

Climate change. Climate change is the most urgent and alarming
long-­term threat to child health and well-­being in this century. Contributing to environmental degradation, the loss of natural resources
and change in climate undermine food and water sources. Climate
change and an increased frequency and severity of humanitarian crises
have already adversely affected children’s health and nutrition. Advocacy at local, national, and international levels to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions are needed.
Conflict, emergency situations, and migration. During times of crisis, children, adolescents, and women are most vulnerable (Fig. 3.14).
Although the youngest are the most likely to perish because of disease
or injuries, all children suffer as a result of food shortages, poor water
and sanitation, interrupted education, and family separation or displacement. Approximately 281 million migrants live outside their countries of
birth, which includes 35 million young children and adolescents under
the age of 20 who have migrated either with their parents or are unaccompanied. Many other children are affected by migration through
parental separation because of deportation or emigration.
Children and adolescents crossing borders are often not entitled to the same protections and rights as those who reside in a
given country, leaving them at greater risk of discrimination and
exploitation. A rights-­based approach to migration is required to
reinforce the steady buildup of support and attention to migration
issues at the international and national levels. This approach must
also address the long-­term social and health consequences and the
root causes of migration (e.g., instability, inequality, discrimination,
poverty) in the country of origin and should incorporate policies

specifically targeted for young children, adolescents, young women,
and vulnerable populations, including those left behind when family members migrate away (Fig. 3.15).
Health information and communications technology. The widespread proliferation of health information and communications technology (HICT) has transformed health care. Social media and mobile
apps can be used to raise awareness and build skills, especially in
LMICs, where other channels of public health messages may not be
readily accessible.
The dissemination of HICT has not been equitable. The majority
of LMICs are still in the early stages of adoption. Many healthcare
settings in LMICs rely exclusively on paper-­based records or simple
electronic data-­capture tools such as spreadsheets for disease surveillance, reporting, and research. Barriers to implementing HICT
in LMICs include lack of health data infrastructures, reliable internet and electricity, workforce training, tools that fit local healthcare
needs and culture, and sustainable funding. A further challenge is
the need to ensure privacy and security while standardizing the format in which health data are captured to permit sharing of health
information across facilities to reduce costly inefficiencies and to
improve quality of care. Balanced partnerships between health
care and technology communities across low-, middle-, and highincome countries are needed to share knowledge, foster innovation,
and strengthen health information systems to advance equitable
health outcomes.

Chapter 4

Quality and Value in
Healthcare for Children
Trisha L. Marshall, Amanda C. Schondelmeyer,
and Jeffrey M. Simmons
THE NEED FOR IMPROVEMENT IN QUALITY
AND VALUE

Adults and children receive recommended evidence-­based care only
about half the time. The gap between knowledge and practice widens to
a chasm in part because of variations in practice and disparities in care
from doctor to doctor, institution to institution, geographic region to
geographic region, and socioeconomic group to socioeconomic group.
Furthermore, it is estimated that it routinely takes more than a decade
for new knowledge to be adopted into clinical practice.
In addition to appropriate care that patients do not receive, the
U.S. healthcare systems also deliver much care that is unnecessary
and waste many resources in doing so. This overuse or waste is
one key driver of the disproportionate costs of care in the United
States compared with other developed countries’ delivery systems
(in 2016, the United States spent about twice as much per capita,
adjusting for gross domestic product [GDP], on healthcare compared to the average of peer wealthy nations). It is estimated that
more than one quarter of all U.S. healthcare spending is waste. Gaps
in appropriate care, combined with overuse and high costs, have
driven conversations about the need to improve the value of care,
which would mean better quality at lower overall costs. Choosing
Wisely, an initiative initially sponsored by the American Board of
Internal Medicine Foundation and subsequently endorsed by the
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), asked medical societies to
identify overused practices that clinicians could then make collective efforts to address.

WHAT ARE QUALITY AND VALUE?

The National Academy of Medicine (NAM) defines quality of
healthcare as “the degree to which healthcare services for individuals and populations increases the likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge.” To
measure healthcare quality, they identified Six Dimensions of Quality: effectiveness, efficiency, equity, timeliness, patient safety,
and patient-­centered care. Healthcare services need to be effective,
which means that they should result in benefits and be grounded in
evidence whenever possible. Healthcare services also need to be efficient, which incorporates the idea of avoiding waste and improving
system cost efficiencies, and the services should be safe for patients.
Healthcare services must be timely, thus incorporating the need
for appropriate access to care (see Chapter 5). Healthcare services
should be equitable, which highlights the importance of minimizing variations as a result of race, ethnicity, gender, geographic location, and socioeconomic status (SES). Healthcare quality should be
patient centered, which underscores the importance of identifying
and incorporating individual patient needs, preferences, and values in clinical decision-­making. In pediatrics, the patient-­centered
dimension extends to family-­centeredness, so that the needs, preferences, and values of parents and other child caregivers are considered in care decisions and system design.
This framework emphasizes the concept that all Six Dimensions of
Quality need to be met for the provision of high-­quality healthcare.
Collectively, the Six Dimensions of Quality represent quality in the
overall value proposition of quality per cost. Value remains a critical
concept, though difficult to measure accurately.

The evolving healthcare system requires physicians, healthcare providers, hospitals, and healthcare organizations to partner
together and with patients to define, measure, and improve the
overall quality and value of care delivered. Concrete examples of
the evolving U.S. perspective include the widespread adoption of
Maintenance of Certification (MOC) requirements by medical-­
certifying bodies, which require providers to engage in activities
that improve care in their practices, and the core quality measurement features and population health incentives of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010. The ACA also
established the Patient-­C entered Outcomes Research Institute
(PCORI) to develop a portfolio of effectiveness and implementation research that requires direct engagement of patients and families to partner in setting research priorities, formulating research
questions, and designing studies that will directly affect the needs
of patients to improve the value of the research.
Although significant progress has been made along many dimensions of quality, a notable gap is the lack of progress on addressing
inequities in healthcare. Disparities in healthcare based on racial or
ethnic background, SES, and for patients and families with limited
English proficiency are well documented and include inequities in
access to care, treatment of pain, and in number of adverse events
experienced during acute hospitalizations (see Chapter 2).

FRAMEWORKS FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT

Quality improvement (QI) science is a predominant method used to
close gaps and improve value. Initially focused on improving performance and reliability in care processes, more recently, in part
inspired by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s Triple Aim
approach, QI is also being used to improve value for populations of
patients by focusing more on outcomes defined by patients’ needs.
The Triple Aim included (1) improving the patient experience of
care, (2) improving the health of populations, and (3) reducing per
capita cost of healthcare. The Quadruple Aim approach adds the
fourth dimension of healthcare worker experience, or joy in work,
to focus delivery systems on the need to consider the resilience and
safety of the clinical workforce in order to maintain the delivery of
high-­value care.
Quality is broader in scope than QI. Many quality measurement
systems have attempted to be more transparent with clinicians and
patients about costs of care. Because more direct costs have been
shifted to patients and families through widespread adoption of
high-­deductible insurance plans (i.e., families experience lower up-­
front insurance coverage costs but pay for certain acute healthcare
expenses out-­of-­pocket until the preset deductible is met), better
awareness of costs has become a more important driver of improvement in value, in part by reducing overuse.
The applied science of QI currently in use in healthcare is also
firmly grounded in the classic scientific method of observation,
hypothesis, and planned experimentation. There are four key features of the applied science of QI: appreciation of systems, understanding variation, knowledge theory, and psychology of change.
In addition to this theoretical framework, statistical analytic techniques have evolved to better evaluate variable systems over time.
Although each derives key features from this applied scientific
foundation, multiple QI methodologies are currently in use in
healthcare. At their most parsimonious level, each method can be
described as a three-­step model: Data → Information → Improvement. Quality needs to be measured. Data obtained from measurement needs to be converted into meaningful information that can
be analyzed, compared, and reported. Information must then be
actionable to achieve improvements in clinical practice and health
systems’ processes. Some common approaches to conducting QI in
healthcare, many of which originated in manufacturing, include
Model for Improvement, Six Sigma, and Lean methodologies. These
approaches are not mutually exclusive and share common features
and tools. The Model for Improvement is an overarching framework

colitis). This work was supported by the ImproveCareNow Network
(https://improvecarenow.org/), a learning health system. A learning
health system is a collaborative endeavor organized around communities of patients, clinicians, and researchers working together
to integrate research with QI (i.e., knowledge dissemination and
implementation) to improve care delivery while advancing clinical
research. For the IBD network, outpatient gastroenterology practices
standardized treatment approaches to align with existing evidence
through QI interventions adapted to local circumstances. Therapeutic decisions for individual patients remained at the discretion of
physicians and their patients.

Six Sigma

Six Sigma is related to the reduction in undesirable variation in processes. Six Sigma attempts to provide a structured approach to unwanted
variations in healthcare processes. Six Sigma approaches have been
successfully used in healthcare to improve processes in both clinical
and nonclinical settings.

Lean Methodology

Lean methodology focuses on reducing waste within a process in a
system. Figure 4.2A illustrates the steps in the process of a patient
coming to the emergency department (ED). After the initial registration, the patient is seen by a nurse and then the physician. In a
busy ED, a patient may need to wait for hours before registration is
complete and the patient is placed in the examination room. This
wait time is a waste from the perspective of the patient and the family. Incorporating the registration process after placing the patient
in the physician examination room can save time and minimize
waste (see Fig. 4.2B). Lean methods have been successfully used in
several outpatient and inpatient settings with resulting improvements in efficiency. Lean principles have also been adopted as a
core strategy for many children’s hospitals and health systems with
the goal of improving efficiencies, including access, while reducing waste. These efforts can improve aspects of quality while also

The Model for Improvement is structured around three key questions: (1) What are we trying to accomplish? (2) How will we know
that a change is an improvement? and (3) What change can we
make that will result in improvement? Clarifying the first question,
the goal, is critical and is often a step skipped by clinicians, who
typically already have change ideas in mind. The second question
is about defining measures, with an emphasis on practicality and
efficiency. The third question is about defining testable ideas for
improvement, which are subsequently tested using a framework
of rapid cycle improvement, also known as the plan-­do-­study-­act
(PDSA) cycle (Fig. 4.1A). The PDSA cycle is typically aimed at
testing small care process changes in iterative, rapid cycles. After
discrete testing periods, results are analyzed, and the next cycle of
change testing is planned and implemented (i.e., multiple PDSA
cycles, often called a PDSA ramp, build on previous learning from
PDSAs; see Fig. 4.1B). Valuable information can be obtained from
PDSA cycles that are successful, and those that are not, to help plan
the next iteration of the PDSA cycle. The PDSA cycle specifically
requires that improvements be data driven. Many clinicians attempt
to make changes for improvement in their practice based on clinical
intuition rather than on interpretation of empirical data. Data can
be either quantitative or qualitative in nature.
One successful QI collaborative using the Model for Improvement
in the outpatient setting is related to improvements in remission
rates and reduction in systemic corticosteroid use among children
with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD, Crohn disease, or ulcerative

typically reducing costs. Another key principle of Lean methods is
the empowerment of the workforce and frontline leaders to make
changes that reduce hassles for them and for patients.

Tools for Organizing Quality Improvement Theory
and Execution

QI efforts need to be organized around a theory of how the desired
changes in outcome will be achieved. Multiple tools are available to
help organize a QI team’s thinking and execution. These tools typically
help teams organize work into discrete projects or phases, and some of
them also help teams develop change ideas.
Key driver diagrams (KDDs) are a tool to organize the theory of
learning that underpins a QI project (Fig. 4.3), using the Model for
Improvement. Important aspects of a KDD include a statement of the
specific aim or improvement goal; a list of the key themes, or drivers,
that are theorized to require improvement in order to achieve the aim;
and lastly a list of the discrete change ideas or initiatives to be tested to
determine whether or not they affect discrete drivers, and therefore the
overall aim. Because most system outcomes are driven by multiple factors, a KDD allows a QI team to depict a theory that addresses multiple
factors. Similarly, Lean and Six Sigma projects use a tool called an A3
that, in addition to organizing the theory of a project, also prompts
teams to assess the current state and consider timelines and personnel
for planned change (examples are available at https://www.lean.org/co
mmon/display).
There are additional QI tools to help assess the current state of
a system to better understand how to improve it. One, the failure

modes and effects analysis (FMEA), also helps teams develop
change ideas (Fig. 4.4). Starting with a map of the processes in the
current system, FMEA then asks teams to investigate and brainstorm the many ways discrete processes can go wrong—the failure
modes. Once failure modes are identified, teams begin to develop
discrete interventions or countermeasures to address the failures
(see Chapter 5). A similar tool, the fishbone or cause-­and-­effect
diagram, is organized around key components in a system (e.g.,
people, material, machines) and helps a team catalog how deficiencies in each component can affect the overall outcome of a system.
Another tool to help teams prioritize action is a Pareto chart, which
organizes system deficiencies in terms of their prevalence (Fig. 4.5).
A Pareto chart typically displays the individual prevalence of discrete problems, determined by baseline analysis of data, as well as the
cumulative prevalence, helping teams see which problems should be
addressed first to maximize impact on the overall outcome.

MEASURING QUALITY

Robust quality indictors should have clinical and statistical relevance.
Clinical relevance ensures that the indicators are meaningful to patient
care from the standpoint of patients and clinicians. Statistical relevance
ensures that the indicators have measurement properties to allow an
acceptable level of accuracy and precision. These concepts are captured
in the national recommendations that quality measures must meet the
criteria of being valid, reliable, feasible, and usable (Table 4.1). Validity of quality measures refers to the measure being an estimate of the
true concept of interest. Reliability refers to the measure being reproducible and providing the same result if retested. It is important that
quality measures are feasible in practice, with an emphasis on how the
data supporting the measures are collected. Quality measures must be
usable, which means that they should be clinically meaningful. The
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the National
Quality Forum have provided specific criteria to be considered when
developing quality measures.

Chapter 4 u Quality and Value in Healthcare for Children
Several categories of quality measures can be used to measure the
performance of healthcare systems: structure, process, outcome, and
balancing. Structure refers to the organizational characteristics in
healthcare delivery. Examples of organizational characteristics are
the number of physicians and nurses in an acute care setting and
the availability and use of systems such as electronic health records
(EHRs). Process measures estimate how services are provided;
examples are the percentage of families of children with asthma who
receive an asthma action plan as part of their office visit and the percentage of hospitalized children who have documentation of pain
assessments as part of their care. Outcome measures refer to the final
health status of the child; examples are risk-­adjusted survival in an
intensive care unit setting, birthweight-­adjusted survival in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) setting, and the functional status of
children with chronic conditions such as cystic fibrosis. Balancing
measures are often used to ensure changes in processes or systems do
not have unintended consequence. If a healthcare system is actively
working to reduce hospital length of stay for common conditions, it
would be beneficial to ensure that hospital readmission rates are not
increasing.
It is important to distinguish between measures for accountability and measures for improvement. Measures, particularly
measures for accountability that may be linked to attribution and
payment, must be based on a rigorous process (Fig. 4.6). This can
be resource-­intensive and time-­consuming. In contrast, measures
for improvement serve a different purpose—to track incremental
improvements linked to specific QI efforts. These may not undergo
rigorous testing, and they often have limited applicability beyond
the specific QI setting.
Quality data can be quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative
data includes numerical data, which can be continuous (patient satisfaction scores represented as a percentage, with higher numbers
indicating better satisfaction) or categorical (patient satisfaction
scores from a survey using a Likert scale indicating satisfactory,
unsatisfactory, good, or superior care). Data can also be qualitative
in nature, which includes nonnumerical data. Examples of qualitative data can include results from open-­ended surveys related to the
experience of care in a clinic or hospital setting.

Data measuring quality of care can be obtained from a variety
of sources, which include chart reviews, patient surveys, existing
administrative data sources (i.e., billing data), disease and specialty
databases, and patient registries, which track individual patients
over time. Sources of data vary in terms of reliability and accuracy,
which will influence rigor and therefore appropriate-­use cases for
the data; many national databases invest significant resources in
implementing processes to improve data reliability and accuracy.
Data quality can become a significant impediment when using
data from secondary sources, which can adversely affect the overall
quality evaluation.
Health information technology (HIT) is a critical component in
the effort to improve quality. EHRs have resulted in an unprecedented
rise in available healthcare data, including traditional, structured data
fields such as patient demographic and billing diagnosis codes, as well
as unstructured data such as written clinician documentation in notes
and imaging studies. The 21st Century Cures Act aims to facilitate the
exchange and use of electronic health information “without special
effort” on the part of the user. The Cures Act was designed to address
concerns about interoperability and usability of electronic health systems, which can be barriers to care, improvement, and research.
The potential applications of big data in quality improvement are far
reaching and include advancements in clinical informatics designed to
better predict, manage, and treat common illnesses and provide effective, evidence-­based, real-­time, clinical decision-­making support. For
example, the Hospital for Sick Children at the University of Toronto is
using a real-­time data gathering and analysis framework to detect subtle changes on infant heart monitors that may predict potential cases of
late-­onset neonatal sepsis.

ANALYZING QUALITY DATA

The classic statistical approach from a research paradigm has been
applied to quality data for comparing trends over time and differences before and after an intervention. Another approach from an
improvement science paradigm uses techniques such as run charts
and statistical process control (SPC) charts to track data longitudinally to assess for changes in a system over time. There are several advantages to using run or SPC charts when analyzing quality

data—for example, these tools allow evaluation of the effectiveness
of various interventions in near real time. Additionally, when using
an SPC chart QI teams can also more clearly assess how variation
in a process or system is changing over time. Two types of variations are important to distinguish between. Random variation, also
called common cause variation, refers to the variation that is inherent in a process and is expected in any system. In contrast, special cause variation refers to nonrandom variation that can affect
a process and implies something in the system has been perturbed.
When tracking infection rates in a nursery, for example, a sudden
increase in the infection rates may be secondary to a planned or
unexpected change in a product or supply critical to infection prevention. This would represent a special cause variation; once the
supply issue is resolved or mitigated, the system perturbation is
resolved, and the infection rates will likely go back to the baseline
level. Alternatively, improvement ideas are intended to perturb the
system positively such that outcomes improve, ideally without exacerbating the variation in the system (Fig. 4.7). Both run and SPC
charts have established rules to assess for special cause variation or
a statistically significant change in a process or system over time.

EXPANDING INDIVIDUAL QUALITY IMPROVEMENT
INITIATIVES TO SCALE

Despite the success of individual QI projects, the overall progress
to achieve large-­scale improvements to reach all children across
the spectrum of geographic location and SES remains limited. This
contributes to the health disparities that persist for children, with
significant differences in access and quality of care. A potential factor that limits the full impact of QI is the lack of strategic alignment
of improvement efforts with hospitals, health systems, and across
states.
This challenge can be viewed from a system standpoint in being
able to conduct and expand QI from a micro level (individual projects), to the meso level (regional), to the macro level (national
and international). The learning from individual QI projects for
addressing specific challenges can be expanded to the regional
level by ensuring that there is optimal leadership, opportunity for
education, and adoption of improvement science (Fig. 4.8). To further expand the learning to a national and international level, it is
important to leverage implementation science to allow a strategic
approach to the identification of the key factors that influence success. To leverage fully the synergies in order to impact the quality
of care delivered to children, it is important for national and international healthcare organizations to collaborate effectively from a
knowledge management and improvement standpoint (Table 4.2).

At the health system level, there is an increasing emphasis on quality reporting in healthcare in the United States. Many states have
mandatory policies for the reporting of quality data. This reporting may be tied to reimbursement using the approach of pay-­for-­
performance (P4P), which implies that reimbursements by insurers
to hospitals and physicians will be partially based on the quality
metrics. An extension of the P4P concept relates to the implementation of the policy of nonreimbursable hospital-­acquired conditions, formerly called never events by the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS has identified a list of hospital-­
acquired conditions, which are specific quality events that will
result in no payment for subsequent care provided to patients, such
as wrong-­site surgery, central line–associated bloodstream infections (CLA-­BSIs), and pressure ulcers. This approach has not yet
been widely implemented for pediatric patients.
There are growing, internet-­based, commercial platforms for
sharing information about patient and family experiences of care
with specific clinical sites and specific providers. Many children’s
hospitals have also developed their own websites for voluntarily
reporting their quality information, including ratings of care experiences. Although greater transparency may provide a competitive
advantage to institutions, the underlying policy goal of transparency is to improve the quality of care being delivered and for families to be able to make informed choices in selecting hospitals and
providers for their children.
When comparing quality measures across clinical settings, it is
important to perform risk adjustments. Risk adjustment is the statistical concept that uses measures of underlying severity or risk
so that the outcomes can be compared in a meaningful manner.
The importance of risk adjustment was highlighted in the pediatric
intensive care unit (PICU) setting many years ago. The unadjusted
mortality rate for large tertiary care centers was significantly higher
than that for smaller hospital settings. However, after severity of
illness risk adjustment, it was subsequently shown that the risks
in tertiary-­care, large PICUs were higher because patients had, in
general, greater severity of illness. Although this concept is intuitive for most clinicians, the use of severity of illness models allows
mathematical estimates of patient severity using physiologic and
laboratory data and permits meaningful comparisons of the outcomes across institutions, which may care for patient populations
varying in complexity and acuity.
At the individual physician level, quality measures may also
be used for purposes of certification as part of the MOC process.
In the past, specialty and subspecialty certification in medicine,
including pediatrics, was largely based on demonstrating a core
fund of knowledge by being successful on an examination. Further,
no specific evidence of competency in actual practice needed to
be demonstrated beyond successful completion of a training program. However, significant variation in practice patterns among

physicians who are board certified has demonstrated how medical knowledge is important, but not sufficient, for the delivery of
high-­quality care. In response, the American Board of Medical Specialties, including its member board, the American Board of Pediatrics, implemented the MOC process in 2010. Within the MOC
process, there is a specific requirement (Part IV) for the physician
to demonstrate the assessment of their quality of care and implementation of improvement strategies as part of recertification in
pediatrics and pediatric subspecialties. Lifelong learning and the
translation of learning into practice are the basis for the MOC process and an essential competency for physicians’ professionalism.
This concept has also filtered in to graduate medical education, as
demonstrated by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical
Education requirement for residency programs to incorporate QI
curriculum to ensure that systems-­based practice and QI are part of
the overall competencies within accredited graduate medical training programs.

IMPLICATIONS OF THE U.S. HEALTHCARE REFORM
FOR QUALITY

Regarding quality of healthcare for children, healthcare reform
efforts had three key implications. First, expanded insurance coverage optimized access and include expanded coverage for young
adults to age 26 years. Second, various initiatives related to quality, safety, patient-­
centered outcomes research, and innovation
were implemented and funded. For example, the AHRQ funded
a national effort to establish 7 centers of excellence through the
Pediatric Quality Measurement Program (PQMP) to improve
existing pediatric quality measures and create new measures that
can be used by states and in a variety of other settings to evaluate
quality of care for children. Third, reform advocated a paradigm

shift in the existing model of healthcare delivery from vertical integration toward a model of horizontal integration. This has led to
the creation and rapid growth of integrated delivery systems and
risk-­sharing relationships through accountable care organizations
(ACOs). Population health outcomes from these changes remain
uncertain, although it appears healthcare cost inflation may have
slowed somewhat.
Another area of increasing emphasis is population health. This
is important because it expands the traditional role of physicians to
improve quality of care for individual patients to also improve the
quality of care for larger populations. Populations can be defined by
geographic constraints or disease/patient condition. Efforts to link
payment and reimbursement for care delivery by physicians and
health systems are being increasingly tied to measurable improvements in population health and demonstration of improved value.
To achieve a meaningful improvement in population outcome,
physician practices will need to embrace the emerging paradigm of
practice transformation, whose many facets include the adoption
of a medical home, the seamless connectivity across the primary
care and subspecialty continuum, and a strong connection between
the medical and social determinants of healthcare delivery. To
implement successful practice transformation, health systems are
increasingly striving to evolve to serve children across the entire
range of the care continuum, including preventive and primary care
and acute hospital care, and to partner with community organizations for enhancing social supports. In addition, new risk-­sharing
payment models are being developed, such as value-­based purchasing, which represent a financial risk-­sharing model across primary
and subspecialty care and hospitals.

Safety in Healthcare for
Children
Patrick W. Brady, Tina K. Sosa, and
Jeffrey M. Simmons

Children may be harmed by the healthcare that aims to make them
better. Such harms include central line–associated bloodstream
infections (CLA-­BSIs) and medication errors. In 1991 the Harvard
Medical Practice Study reviewed adult medical records from New
York State and found that adverse events occurred in an estimated
3.7% of hospitalizations. Most events gave rise to serious disability,
and 13.6% led to death. The National Academy of Medicine estimated that as many as 98,000 Americans per year die in the hospital
from medical errors.
Although fewer data are available for children, it is evident that children experience substantial healthcare-­related harm. Nationally, hospitalized children experience approximately 1,700 CLA-­BSIs and 84,000
adverse drug events each year. Although the evidence is less robust,
and not without controversy, substantial progress has been reported,
particularly in healthcare-­associated conditions (HACs). Less strong
epidemiologic estimates are available for adverse events in the ambulatory environment, but these events are likely more common than
reported.
The Solutions for Patient Safety (SPS) collaborative includes >145
children’s hospitals across the United States and Canada (http://www
.solutionsforpatientsafety.org) and uses a learning network model to
pursue the aim of eliminating serious harm across all children’s hospitals. In addition, healthcare has recognized the high rates of healthcare
worker injury and the critical role that the safety of healthcare providers plays in outcomes, burnout, and safe patient care.

ERROR VS HARM

Clinical leaders, improvers, and researchers often employ measures
of error and harm to understand and improve safety, but the differences between these two measures can lead to confusion. Errors
occur when a member of the healthcare team does the wrong thing
(error of commission) or fails to do the right thing (error of omission); errors of omission (e.g., not arriving at the right diagnosis)
are considerably more difficult to measure. Harm, as defined by
the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, is “unintended physical
injury resulting from or contributed to by medical care (including
the absence of indicated medical treatment), that requires additional monitoring, treatment, or hospitalization, or that results in
death.” Most errors in healthcare do not lead to harm; harm may be
both preventable and nonpreventable (Fig. 5.1). A physician may
erroneously fail to add a decimal point in a medication order for
an aminoglycoside antibiotic, ordering a dose of 25 mg/kg rather
than the intended dose of 2.5 mg/kg. If this error is caught by the
computerized order entry system or the pharmacist, this would be
an error with no resultant harm. If this error was not caught and
reached the patient, who suffered acute kidney injury, this would
be preventable harm since evidence shows that pharmacist review
can reduce the risk of these errors 10-­fold. Alternatively, if a patient
received a first lifetime dose of amoxicillin and had anaphylaxis
requiring hospital admission, this harm would be considered nonpreventable since no valid predictive tests are available for antibiotic allergy. Furthermore, the concept of latent risk, independent
of any actual error, is inherent in any system where patients can be
harmed. Among errors that do not lead to harm, near misses that

do not reach patients—or high-­risk situations that do not lead to
harm because of good fortune or mitigation—are important learning opportunities about safety threats.
Several classification systems exist to rate harm severity, including the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error
Reporting and Prevention (NCC-­MERP) Index for medication-­
related harm and the severity scales for all-­cause harm. Serious
safety events (SSEs) are deviations from expected practice followed
by death or severe harm. The SPS collaborative has SSE elimination as its primary goal. Sentinel events or never events, such as
a wrong-­site surgery, are also targets of external reporting and
for elimination through quality improvement (QI) initiatives (see
Chapter 4). Increasingly, health systems are using a composite serious harm index, which combines a variety of preventable HACs
(e.g., CLA-­BSIs) to examine system safety performance over time
across various patient populations and sites of care.

SAFETY FRAMEWORKS

Safety frameworks are conceptual models and tools to help clinicians, improvers, and researchers understand the myriad contributors to safe healthcare and safety events. Healthcare is delivered
in a complex system with many care providers and technologies,
such as electronic health records and continuous physiologic monitors. The Donabedian framework, which links structure, process,
and outcome, can be a very useful tool. The Systems Engineering
Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) model, developed by human
factors engineers, cognitive psychologists, and physicians, provides
more detailed tools to understand the work system and the complex interactions between people (including the patient and family) and task work and technology and the environment. The SEIPS
3.0 model uses the concept of the “patient journey” to describe a
patient’s interactions with multiple complex and separate care settings over time. Other available safety frameworks include those
from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement. The “Swiss cheese”
model illustrates how multiple components of an organization’s
defenses prevent failures from leading to harm, but harm may occur
when multiple defenses fail at the same time (Fig. 5.2).
Traditionally, safety science and improvement have focused on
identifying what went wrong (near misses, errors, and harm) and
then tried to understand and improve the system of care that led
to these events (Safety-­I framework). There is increasing focus on
what goes right. This framework, called Safety-­II, brings focus on
the much greater number of things that go right and how people
act every day to create safety in complex and unpredictable systems.
Safety-­II seeks to learn from people, the greatest source of system
resilience, particularly in the midst of high levels of risk and stress,
as often seen in healthcare.

IDENTIFYING AND ANALYZING HARM, ERRORS,
AND LATENT THREATS

Health systems use a toolbox of processes to discover, understand, and
mitigate unsafe conditions.

for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to support an
infant with respiratory failure. Identifying—and then mitigating—
this latent threat in a simulated environment is preferable to doing
so in an acutely deteriorating child.

Incident Reporting Systems

Event Analysis

Many health systems and hospitals offer employees access to a
system to report errors, harms, or near misses. Most frequently,
these are anonymous so that healthcare workers feel safe to submit an event in which they may have been involved or when the
harm involved someone in a position of authority. Ideally, these
systems facilitate smooth and efficient entry of enough information for further review but avoid excessive burden of time or cognitive load on the reporter. Incident reporting systems likely work
best in the presence of a strong safety culture and when employees
have some confidence that the event will be reviewed and actions
taken. The chief limitation of incident reporting systems is that
incident reports dramatically underreport safety events. Thus other
mechanisms must also be in place to learn about safety. Trigger tool
systems use triggers, such as the need for an antidote to an opioid
overdose or the transfer of a patient to higher-­level care, to facilitate
targeted medical record review by trained nurses and physicians to
elucidate any errors or system risks.

Simulation

Simulation is an excellent tool to better understand system and
latent threats. High-­fidelity simulation, which involves the use of a
manikin that can reproduce or mimic human anatomy and physiology, can allow clinicians to practice technical skills such as intubation in a safe environment. Perhaps more importantly, simulation
can help clinical teams improve nontechnical skills such as using
closed-­loop communication and sharing a mental model (e.g., a
team leader states, “I believe this patient has septic shock. We are
rapidly infusing fluids and giving antibiotics. Blood pressure is normal for age. What other thoughts does the team have?”). It is often
easier and more feasible to give feedback in a simulated scenario
versus a real event.
Low-­fidelity simulation does not require costly simulated patients
and may have advantages in identifying latent threats in the hospital
or clinic. For example, a simulated scenario on a medical-­surgical
unit might identify that nurses do not know where to find a mask

Several types of event analysis, including root cause analysis, apparent cause analysis, and common cause analysis, can help teams
understand—and later mitigate—the causes of adverse events. Each
model has its own strengths and weaknesses. Root cause analysis (RCA) is a robust and time-­intensive process to ascertain the
most fundamental, or root, causes of a safety event. The Joint Commission requires the use of RCA on sentinel events. Most health
systems reserve this methodology primarily for sentinel events,
because RCAs can take months to complete and require convening a
multidisciplinary team of experts. The safety event and its antecedents are reviewed in detail with a focus not on human behavior, but
instead on systems, hazards, and latent errors. The RCA team works
to go beyond the event (e.g., enteral formula feeds connected to and
administered through a central line) to the proximal causes (e.g.,
“feeding tube and intravenous tubing are visually identical and are
easily attached”) and root cause (e.g., “organization lacks a system
to assess human factors risks as new equipment is procured and put
into practice”). When root causes are identified and tied to robust
improvement action plans, safety can be substantially improved
(e.g., “we will design feeding tubing and intravenous tubing to be
distinct and incompatible”). In addition to the time-­intensive nature
of RCAs, hindsight bias is a risk and needs to be managed carefully
by the team. Additional challenges with RCAs include the potential
to overfit solutions—designing protocols or procedures that may
have reduced the risk of the specific safety event reviewed but also
introduce new problems and increase the probability of other safety
threats—as well as difficulties in spreading solutions to different
care areas that often have different needs, processes, and goals.
Apparent cause analysis, common cause analysis, and failure
modes and effects analysis are complementary learning methods.
Apparent cause analysis is performed by a smaller multidisciplinary team to look primarily for proximal causes, making it feasible for events that occur often (e.g., the wrong medication is sent
from the pharmacy). Importantly, in each analysis the team works
to determine how likely it is that such an event will occur in the

44 Part I u The Field of Pediatrics
future and how widespread the proximate causes are in the microsystem. Common cause analysis seeks to aggregate learning across
multiple events. A similar common cause, such as poor handoff
procedures, may lead to different safety events (e.g., a missed laboratory check and a delayed diagnosis); common cause analysis aids
leaders in determining this. Failure mode and effects analysis
(FMEA) is a powerful tool that clinicians use to describe a process
and identify failure modes, or ways in which each step might fail. A
more robust and quantitative form of FMEA rates potential failure
modes in three categories: probability of event occurring, its severity, and its ability to be detected. The product of these, called the
risk priority number, can help a team identify which failure modes
may lead to the greatest harm and thus which to target first.

SAFETY CULTURE

A broad and supportive safety culture likely drives both patient and
employee safety outcomes. An organization with a mature safety
culture fosters a culture of learning and treats errors as opportunities to improve the system, rather than as the personal failures
of individual clinicians. Just culture differentiates the mistakes
and wrong decisions that a clinician makes commensurate with
their training and experience from willful violations and gross or
repeated patterns of negligence. A safety culture prioritizes clear
and consistent communication and teamwork and aims to ease
authority gradients (described later). Several tools are available to
measure safety culture, including the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)
surveys on Patient Safety Culture. A strong safety culture supports
transfer of responsibility within disciplines at handoffs and across
disciplines (e.g., when a nurse is calling a physician with a new
concern). Structured communication tools such as the Situation-­
Background-­Assessment-­Recommendation (SBAR) approach are
valued in a safety culture, as are safety behaviors such as “repeat
back or write back,” when a critical laboratory result is shared and
repeated back by the receiving clinician.
Authority gradients are quite real in healthcare. In a culture of
safety, both junior and senior clinicians work together across disciplines to speak up when concerns are identified, to ask questions,
and not to proceed if there is uncertainty about safe patient care.
Health system leaders have a critical role in supporting this culture, orienting new employees to its importance, and stepping in
if authority gradients or disruptive behaviors contribute to safety
events or unsafe conditions. To address the adverse impact of the
healthcare hierarchy on providing safe care, recent efforts have
focused on psychologic safety. Psychologic safety is defined as the
ability to raise concerns and ask questions without the fear of negative consequences for self-­image, status, or career. This concept is
critical for multiple aspects of safety culture, including establishing
a shared mental model, event reviews and debriefs, addressing professionalism concerns, and effectively partnering with patients and
families to pursue safety goals.

RELIABILITY SCIENCE, HUMAN FACTORS
ENGINEERING, AND HIGH-­RELIABILITY
ORGANIZATIONS

Reliability in healthcare is defined as the measurable capability
of a process, procedure, or health service to perform its intended
function in the required time under commonly occurring conditions. Most processes in healthcare organizations currently perform
at Level 1 reliability, meaning a success rate of only 80–90%. To
achieve Level 2 performance (≤5 failures/100 opportunities), processes must be intentionally designed with tools and concepts based
on the principles of human factors engineering and reliability
science. These processes include creating intentional redundancy,
such as independent verification on high-­risk medication dosing,
and making the default action the desired action based on evidence,
such as a default to an influenza vaccination for high-­risk patients

with asthma. Performance at Level 3 (≤5 failures/1,000 opportunities) requires a well-­designed system with low variation and cooperative relationships and a state of “mindfulness,” with attention to
processes, structure, and their relationship to outcomes.
Healthcare can learn important safety lessons from disciplines
such as human factors engineering and cognitive psychology. Industries that better leverage learnings from these disciplines—and
robustly identify and mitigate threats and use simulation—include
commercial aviation and nuclear power, termed high-­reliability
organizations. These organizations achieve exemplary safety
records under dynamic and high-­risk conditions through consistent application of five tenets: (1) a preoccupation with failure—
surprises and errors are thought of as learning opportunities, and
learnings spread quickly through the organization, (2) reluctance to
simplify interpretations—serious safety events receive an RCA, (3)
sensitivity to operations—proactive assessments and huddles target
risks to patients and the organization, (4) a commitment to resilience—errors do not disable, and high-­risk, uncommon scenarios
are negotiated, and (5) deference to expertise—leaders defer to
frontline experts when their knowledge is required.

SERIOUS HARM EVENTS AND HEALTHCARE-­
ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS

Substantial improvement in patient safety has occurred through
improvement teams targeting serious harm events. The serious
harm event rate is a composite metric that groups preventable
HACs into one number (usually a rate per at-­risk patient-­days), so
that an organization or collaborative can track progress on a variety
of conditions with one metric and chart. Table 5.1 lists frequently
targeted HACs. Commonalities among successful improvement
teams targeting these HACs include multidisciplinary team membership, clear outcome definitions and measurement, learning systems around each HAC, and attention to both process and outcome
measures. Many of the successes with CLA-­BSIs were associated
with targeted improvements to reliably adhere to a line insertion
bundle and a line maintenance bundle. Figure 5.3 illustrates coincident improvements in process measures and outcomes measure
in a hypothetical CLA-­BSI project. In this case, after improvement
interventions targeted two process measures known to be important in CLA-­BSI risk—the line insertion and the line maintenance
bundles—the QI team saw improvement in both measures and
coincident reduction in CLA-­BSIs.
A safety culture and experienced improvement teams are consistent drivers of success. A learning network model, as used in
SPS, is effective in bringing project teams together from different
hospitals to discuss lessons learned and common barriers faced and
negotiated.

SAFETY OPPORTUNITIES AND GAPS

In addition to HACs, several other safety events are the targets of
active study and improvement. Unrecognized clinical deterioration in hospitalized children, diagnostic error, poor handoffs across
multiple stakeholders, and alarm/alert fatigue lead to substantial
and preventable harm. There are also important considerations
for improving safety in unique sites of care, including the surgical
and ambulatory environments. Additionally, it is increasingly clear
that patient safety improvements might be limited if the field does
not also target improved occupational safety of those who provide
care.

Clinical Deterioration

The deterioration of hospitalized patients is rarely a sudden and unpredictable event; rather, it is often preceded by abnormal vital signs and
concerns from patients, families, and clinicians. Rapid response systems are designed to detect deterioration and then deploy teams with
critical care expertise to provide treatment or escalate care to an intensive care unit (ICU). Although variation remains in how these teams

are activated and staffed, all U.S. children’s hospitals have some version
of a rapid response system. The initiation of rapid response teams is
associated with a significant reduction in codes outside the ICU and
in-­hospital mortality.
Pediatric early warning scores (PEWS) are used in many large
children’s hospitals to identify deteriorating patients by assigning
scores based on the degree of abnormalities in different body systems.
Different versions of PEWS are often employed, but all include scores
driven by age-­based vital signs and nursing assessments in areas such
as mental status and perfusion. Importantly, PEWS take these diverse
exam elements and combine them into a single score, which when
coupled with clear, expected actions (e.g., evaluation by physician at
score of 5, evaluation by rapid response team at score of 7) may better
detect deterioration and improve safety outcomes.
PEWS are one method of improving a clinician’s situation awareness—the sense of what is going on around the clinician, the notion
of what is important, and the anticipation of future consequences.
Maintaining situation awareness can be challenging in dynamic,
high-­risk environments such as healthcare. Work at several children’s hospitals to improve situation awareness has been associated
with sustained and significant reductions in unrecognized clinical
deterioration. This improvement work first designed systematic and
proactive identification of watcher patients, or those a nurse, physician, or patient family felt were close to the edge of deterioration.
These high-­risk patients are discussed at multidisciplinary bedside
“huddles,” and specific treatment plans and predictions are outlined.
Concerns are more fully addressed through the rapid response team
and at hospital-­wide safety huddles and safety rounds. To gain a
better sense of organization safety and performance threats, many
hospitals in the SPS collaborative employ a daily safety or operations brief, where leaders from a variety of service lines (e.g., inpatient, pharmacy, perioperative care) can discuss unexpected events
and rapidly develop solutions and follow-­
up plans to mitigate
emerging threats that cross disciplines. Event debriefs and reviews

are particularly relevant for instances of clinical deterioration. They
serve multiple purposes, including the emotional processing of an
event, a discussion of the process of care and team performance,
and the development of action plans to improve care in the future.
The Pediatric Resuscitation Quality Collaborative (pediRES-­
Q:
https://www.pedires-­q.org/) classifies debriefs into two types: (1)
“hot” debriefs, which occur minutes to hours after the event and
allow for emotional processing and educational discussion, and
(2) “cold” debriefs, which occur days to weeks after the event and
allow for a comprehensive, multidisciplinary review of all data and
feedback. Current research and improvement efforts in this area are
focused on developing successful frameworks to guide discussions
and action plan development, such as formal processes for classifying and reviewing cardiac arrest events in the pediatric ICU.
Cardiopulmonary arrest rates outside of the ICU are useful metrics
to evaluate the performance of rapid response systems in adult patients.
Given that these events are quite rare in pediatrics, and increasingly so
since the implementation of rapid response systems, the identification of
valid, more frequent proximal metrics is a focus of research efforts. Table
5.2 describes proximal metrics to arrest and the types of code events used
to identify risk factors for unrecognized deterioration and evaluate rapid
response system effectiveness in pediatrics.

Diagnostic Error

Diagnostic error is recognized as an increasingly common and
impactful event, with 10–15% of diagnoses estimated to be incorrect. There are two systems of clinical decision-­making. System 1 is
fast, instinctual, and largely unconscious. System 2 is slow, effortful,
cognitive, and calculating. System 1 and its heuristics or biases allow
for quick—almost automatic—decision-­making, often by associating
new information with existing patterns or beliefs (e.g., that red object
on the right side of the road is a stop sign; I should stop). However,
system 1 thinking can be dangerous in diagnosis, particularly when
new data are unconsciously made to fit the preconceived pattern and

are not seen as disconfirming. Research in this area aims to better
understand how well-­described cognitive biases (e.g., premature closure, availability bias) play out in clinical care and what system-­based
strategies can mitigate their effects (Tables 5.3 to 5.5). There are ongoing efforts to move clinicians from system 1 to system 2 thinking,
such as being explicit on uncertainty (e.g., patients admitted from
the emergency department [ED] as “uncertain diagnosis”) or using

decision aids to prompt revisiting provisional diagnoses such as the
diagnostic time-­out or team-­based (collective intelligence) thinking (Tables 5.6 and 5.7). Safety culture is critical to both the open
acknowledgment of diagnostic uncertainty and the willingness to
discuss and learn from diagnostic error when it occurs.

communication to patients and families in the diagnostic process while introducing a diagnostic process model with several
important outcomes (Fig. 5.4). The diagnostic process occurs with
iterative cycles of information gathering, its integration and interpretation, and the formulation of a working diagnosis. The NAM
report brought particular emphasis to the diagnostic team, which
includes doctors and nurses in different practice contexts (e.g., the
ED and primary care), as well as pharmacists, respiratory therapists,
patients, and families. Strategies that aim to leverage the diagnostic
team, as opposed to simply the cognition of busy individuals, may
be particularly well poised to improved patient-­level and system-­
diagnostic outcomes.

Handoffs/I-­PASS

There is a growing evidence base on the consequences of poor handoffs and on complex interventions to improve handoffs and resultant

safety outcomes. The best-­studied handoff is resident-­to-­resident
shift handoff in teaching hospitals. Use of the I-­PASS mnemonic—
illness severity, patient summary, action list, situation awareness
and contingency planning, and synthesis by receiver—and the surrounding educational quality improvement curriculum was associated with a significant 23% reduction in medical errors and 30%
reduction in adverse events in a nine-­hospital study. Related work
has described improved communication by targeting ICU-­to-­floor,
operating room–to–ICU, and inpatient medical team–to–primary
care handoffs.

Alarm/Alert Fatigue

Alarm fatigue, when a healthcare provider is subject to so many
interruptions that a potentially relevant alarm is not heard, is also
an area of active research and improvement. In the hospital, many
physiologic monitor alarms occur each day (up to 400 per patient

DEFINITION

Anchoring

Locking into a diagnosis based on initial presenting features, failing to adjust diagnostic impressions when
new information becomes available

Confirmation bias

Looking for and accepting only evidence that confirms a diagnostic impression, rejecting or not seeking
contradictory evidence

Diagnostic momentum

Perpetuating a diagnostic label over time, usually by multiple providers both within and across healthcare
systems, despite the label being incomplete or inaccurate

Expertise bias/yin-­yang out

Believing that a patient who has already undergone an extensive evaluation will have nothing more to gain
from further investigations, despite the possibility that the disease process or diagnostic techniques may
have evolved so as to allow for appropriate diagnosis

Overconfidence bias

Believing one knows more than one does, acting on incomplete information or hunches, and prioritizing
opinion or authority, as opposed to evidence

Premature closure

Accepting the first plausible diagnosis before obtaining confirmatory evidence or considering all available
evidence: “When the diagnosis is made, thinking stops”

Unpacking principle

Failing to explore primary evidence or data in its entirety and subsequently failing to uncover important
facts or findings, such as accepting a biopsy report or imaging study report without reviewing the actual
specimen or image; especially important in undiagnosed and rare diseases

DEFINITION

Affective bias

Allowing emotions to interfere with a diagnosis, either positively or negatively; dislikes of patient types
(“frequent flyers”).

Appeal to authority

Deferring to authoritative recommendations from senior, supervising, or “expert” clinicians, independent of
the evidentiary support for such recommendations.

Ascertainment bias

Maintaining preconceived expectations based on patient or disease stereotypes.

Attribution error

Placing undue importance on the perceived internal characteristics or motivations of others, whether they are
the patient, the patient’s family, or other members of the evaluation team.

Countertransference

Being influenced by positive or negative subjective feelings toward a specific patient.

Outcome bias

Minimizing or overemphasizing the significance of a finding or result, often based on subjective feelings about
a patient, a desired outcome, or personal confidence in one’s own clinical skills. The use of “slightly” to
describe abnormal results.

Psych-­out bias

Maintaining biases about people with presumed mental illness.

Table 5.5  Cognitive Biases Related to Errors of Context
BIASES

DEFINITION

Availability bias

Basing decisions on the most recent patient with similar symptoms, preferentially recalling recent and more common
diseases.

Base-­rate neglect

Prioritizing specific information (e.g., a laboratory value) pertaining to a case while ignoring general base rate information
about the prevalence of disease in populations (pretest probability).

Framing effect

Being influenced by how or by whom a problem is described or by the context in which the evaluation takes place.

Frequency bias

Believing that common things happen commonly and usually are benign in general practice.

Hindsight bias

Reinforcing diagnostic errors once a diagnosis is discovered despite these errors. May lead to a clinician overestimating
the efficacy of his or her clinical reasoning and may reinforce ineffective techniques.

Posterior probability
error

Considering the likelihood of a particular diagnosis in light of a patient’s chronic illness. New headaches in a patient
with a history of migraines may in fact be a tumor.

Representative bias

Basing decisions on an expected typical presentation. Not effective for atypical presentations. Overemphasis on
disease-­diagnostic criteria or “classic” presentations. “Looks like a duck, quacks like a duck.”

Sutton’s slip

Ignoring alternative explanations for “obvious” diagnoses (Sutton’s law is that one should first consider the obvious).

Thinking in silo

Restricting diagnostic considerations to a particular specialty or organ system. Each discipline has a set of diseases
within its comfort zone, which reduces diagnostic flexibility or team-­based communication.

Zebra retreat

Lacking conviction to pursue rare disorders even when suggested by evidence.

in some environments), and nurses exposed to a high volume of
alarms respond more slowly to them. Interventions currently being
studied include removing monitors from patients unlikely to benefit from them, designing smart alarms that alert only when certain scenarios occur (e.g., bradycardia in the context of hypoxia),
and using advanced communication technology to safely escalate
true alarms while ignoring nonactionable alarms. Alert fatigue is
related to alarm fatigue but refers to clinicians not processing an
alert, such as a medication interaction from the electronic health
record, when receiving a large burden of alerts often regarded as
nonactionable.

Surgical Safety

Initially, in response to the problem of wrong-­patient or wrong-­site
surgeries, perioperative leaders developed a set of safety strategies
often termed the tenets of surgical safety, which are endorsed by the
World Health Organization (https://www.who.int/patientsafety/safe
surgery/en/). The tenets are implemented as several discrete checklists at key points, or “time-­outs,” in the workflow around a procedure or surgery. Several studies have demonstrated reduced harm to
patients, and surgical checklists are adopted widely throughout surgical and procedural environments. Typically, checklists are used at
three key times during a procedure: before induction of anesthesia,
before skin incision or insertion of a device into any body cavity or
orifice, and before a patient leaves the procedural area or operating
room. Key aspects of the impact of this approach include multidisciplinary active participation, visual display of the checklist or other
key tools as references, and attention to hierarchies and team-­based
communication. An evolving area of surgical and procedural safety is
the use of simulation and video-­based procedure review to improve
surgical technique and perioperative team function and to identify
latent threats.

Ambulatory Safety

Adverse drug events and medication dosing errors are the best-­studied
safety events in the outpatient environment. A study of children
receiving chemotherapy used direct observation by a trained nurse at
home and found approximately 70 errors per 100 patients, many of
which were serious or significant. Families often make dosing errors

Table 5.7  Solutions to Avoid Diagnostic Errors
1.	Enhancing foundational knowledge in medical education
• Teach symptoms and their differential pathophysiology, not just
diseases.
• Emphasize red flags and must-­not-­miss diagnoses.
2.	Minimizing errors related to heuristic failure
• Build understanding of system 1 and system 2 thought
­processes and the risks of heuristic failure.
• Actively model and encourage counterfactual reasoning and
hypothesis generation to enhance system 2 skills.
3.	Mitigating errors of attribution

• Acknowledge that the initial “working” diagnosis may not
always be the final diagnosis.
• Rely on evidence-­based data and avoid authority-­ or
overconfidence-­based errors.
• Recognize that a diagnosis is an iterative and interactive
process that should not be bounded by premature closure or
anchoring. Be open to both confirmatory and nonconfirmatory
data.
• Both know and accept what you do not know.
7.	Critical solutions for complex and undiagnosed and rare-­disease
patients

• Increase awareness of biases toward specific patients by
­promoting self-­reflection.

• Maintain healthy skepticism, especially with patients who come
prediagnosed.

• Use a team-­based approach and diagnostic strategies that
actively dispel biases.

• Analyze historical diagnostic data methodically and thoroughly
and unpack all data completely. Examine actual studies, such as
tissue specimens and imaging investigations, and do not rely on
written reports.

4.	Avoiding errors of context
• Solicit input across a variety of specialties when appropriate.
• Consciously acknowledge the risk of thinking in silo and actively
seek explanations outside of one’s specialty.
5.	Optimizing data gathering, analysis, and hypothesis generation
• Develop differential diagnoses based on pathophysiology;
consider alternatives and competing options.
• Realize that diagnostic criteria for certain diseases do not
­account for atypical disease manifestations.
• Rely on objective individual data, not just disease prevalence rates,
when considering the pretest likelihood of a particular diagnosis.
• Avoid diagnostic momentum and question-­accumulated
diagnostic labels, regardless of who applied the label.
6.	Improving hypothesis testing
• Know the limitations of laboratory tests (i.e., false positives and
negatives).
• Do not be so quick to “rule out” a diagnosis: consider the
posttest likelihood of a disease in terms of a probabilistic
analysis that applies specifically to the patient.

• Question the working diagnosis when findings or the clinical
course does not fit.
• Realize that patients can have more than one disease
process.
• Incorporate all data and avoid minimizing the significance
of abnormal results. Do not ignore contradictory clinical,
laboratory, or imaging data.
• Never say “never” or “it cannot be.”
• Use a systematic team-­based approach to enhance debiasing,
broaden the collective knowledge base, and minimize
context-­related errors.
• Be aware that patients with undiagnosed and rare diseases
may have an atypical or rare manifestation of a recognizable
common disease or may have a rare disease.
• Use extensive literature review and search strategies based on
the patient’s phenotype and individual findings and
hypotheses.

in administering liquid medications, particularly when using kitchen
spoons rather than dosing syringes. A health literacy–informed pictogram reduces the rates of these errors Additional ambulatory safety
threats include delays in diagnosis or treatment caused by mishandling
of laboratory or imaging results and failures in care coordination.

Occupational Safety

The provision of healthcare can be a dangerous profession, with
injury rates that surpass those of coal miners. The magnitude of
this challenge and efforts to improve workplace safety have gained
considerable attention over the past several years. Nurses and physicians still typically view a needlestick injury or back strain from
lifting a patient as simply “part of the job.” A culture of safety should
include employee safety, and health systems should have mechanisms for employees to report injuries, near misses, and threats.
Focused improvement efforts might include the roll-­out of safer
needle systems, education on safe processes, and easy access to
lifts for larger children with limited mobility. Violence and patient
interaction injuries, often from children with psychiatric disease or
developmental disabilities, are a growing source of harm to clinicians. Education for clinicians on de-­escalation techniques, behavioral specialist engagement in bedside care, and implementation of
standardized behavior response teams are active areas of improvement and study as we consider how to best support patients with
behavioral needs admitted to the medical unit.

EMERGING AREAS OF SAFETY RESEARCH AND
IMPROVEMENT
Safe and Equitable Care

The authors of Crossing the Quality Chasm stated that healthcare
should target 6 aims for improvement: safety, effectiveness, patient-­
centeredness, timeliness, efficiency, and equity. These aims are not
independent, and we are just beginning to critically examine the
relationship between safety and equity. Existing evidence suggests
that there are disparities in safety for several groups of pediatric
patients, including Black and Latino children, for children whose
families do not primarily speak English, and for children on public

insurance. In pediatric surgery, one study found that Black children had over three times the odds of dying in the postoperative
period, nearly 20% relative greater odds of postoperative complications, and 7% relative higher odds of developing serious adverse
events as compared to White children, even while controlling for
multiple variables, including racial variation in preoperative morbidity. A systematic review of the evidence in pediatric appendicitis found that social, racial, and economic inequities exist in the
rate of misdiagnosis, laparoscopic versus open approach, length of
stay, and appendiceal perforation rate. In pediatric severe sepsis,
a recent large retrospective study found evidence of an increased
odds of death for Black children as compared to White children,
particularly in the Western and Southern United States. This study
also described longer hospital stays for Hispanic and Black children as compared with White children. Disparities also affect
adverse events for hospitalized children, with one multicenter study
reporting that hospitalized Latino children experience higher rates
of adverse events as compared to non-­L atino White children, and
publicly insured children experience higher rates of preventable
adverse events as compared to those who are privately insured. The
Institute for Healthcare Improvement notes that “there can be no
quality without equity,” and the field of pediatric patient safety is
increasingly focused on health equity as a critical and essential outcome measure.

Learning from Patient and Family Partnerships

Another important area of current and growing research involves how
healthcare providers can partner with patients and families to improve
the safety of care. Families often identify a wide number of errors and
safety events that clinicians fail to report. More important than families simply reporting mistakes are early efforts to engage families more
broadly and deeply to co-­produce healthcare that is efficient, effective,
and safe. This is particularly important for the growing population of
children with complex chronic disease, for whom family caregivers are
critical in identifying deviations from baseline in their children.

Chapter 6 u Ethics in Pediatric Care

Chapter 6

Ethics in Pediatric Care
Eric Kodish and Bryan A. Sisk
Pediatric ethics is the branch of bioethics that analyzes moral aspects of
decisions made relating to the healthcare of children. In general terms,
the autonomy-­driven framework of adult medical ethics is replaced by
a beneficent paternalism in pediatrics. Pediatric ethics is distinctive
because the pediatric clinician has an independent fiduciary obligation
to act in a younger child’s best interest that takes moral precedence
over the wishes of the child’s parent(s). For older children, the concept
of assent suggests that the voice of the patient must be heard. These factors create the possibility of conflict among child, parent, and clinician.
The approach to the ethical issues that arise in pediatric practice must
include respect for parental responsibility and authority balanced with
a child’s developing capacity and autonomy. Heterogeneity of social,
cultural, and religious views about the role of children adds complexity.
Additional features of ethical decision-­making include nonmaleficence (do no harm) and justice (treating patients with the same condition equally).

ASSENT AND PARENTAL PERMISSION

The doctrine of informed consent has limited direct application to
children and adolescents who lack decisional capacity. The capacity for informed decision-­making in healthcare involves the ability to
understand and communicate, to reason and deliberate, and to analyze
conflicting elements of a decision using a set of personal values. The
age at which a competent patient may legally exercise voluntary and
informed consent for medical care varies from state to state, and there
may be exceptions related to specific conditions (sexually transmitted
infections, family planning, drug or alcohol abuse).
In contrast to decisions about one’s own care, a parent’s right to direct
a child’s medical care is more limited. For this reason, the term parental consent is misleading. The concept of parental permission (rather
than consent) reflects a surrogate or proxy decision made by a parent on
behalf of a child. It is constrained by the child’s best interest, even if this
places the clinician in conflict with the parent. In any given instance,
the decision of what is or is not in a child’s best interest may be difficult,
especially given the diverse views of acceptable child rearing and child
welfare. Parents are (and should be) granted wide discretion in raising
their children. In cases involving a substantial risk of harm, the moral
focus should be on avoiding or preventing harm to the child, not on a
parental right to decide. Although the term best interests may be too
high of a threshold requirement, a minimum standard of basic interests
is ethically obligatory.
Respect for children must account for both a child’s vulnerability and
developing capacity. This respect encompasses both the protective role
of parental permission and the developmental role of child assent (the
child’s affirmative agreement). Understanding the concept of assent is
one of the major conceptual challenges in pediatric ethics. The dissent
(or disagreement) of a child is the opposite of assent and is also morally relevant. Pediatric ethics requires clinicians and parents to override a child’s dissent when a proposed intervention is essential to the
child’s welfare. Otherwise, assent should be solicited and dissent honored. In seeking younger children’s assent, a clinician should help them
understand their condition, tell them what they can expect, assess their
understanding and whether they feel pressured to assent, and solicit
their willingness to proceed. All efforts must be made to delineate situations in which the test or procedure will be done regardless of the
child’s assent/dissent, and in such cases the charade of soliciting assent
should be avoided. There is an important distinction between soliciting
assent and respectfully informing a child that a test or procedure will
take place regardless of the child’s decision. Optimally, an educational
process can transpire (if time allows) to gain the trust and assent of the

51

child-­patient. When this cannot occur, pediatric ethics requires that
clinicians apologize to a child for acting to override dissent.
Older children or adolescents (<18 years) may have the cognitive
and emotional capacity to participate fully in healthcare decisions. If
so, the adolescent should be provided with the same information given
to an adult patient. In such situations the patient may be able to provide
informed consent ethically but not legally. The adolescent’s parent(s)
remain in a guiding and protective role. The process of communication and negotiation will be more complex should disagreement arise
between the parent and adolescent. Pediatricians can be effective intercessors when these situations arise, making use of communication
skills in a respectful way that uses an ethical framework.

TREATMENT OF CRITICALLY ILL CHILDREN

Infants, children, and adolescents who become critically ill may recover
fully, may die, or may survive with new or increased limitations of
function. Uncertainty about outcomes can make planning goals of care
difficult or, if misunderstandings among patient, families, and medical
staff occur, may drive conflict over treatment proposals. Ethical issues
that arise during critical illness include balancing benefits, burdens,
and harms of therapy in the face of uncertainty; maintaining a helpful
degree of transparency and communication about medical standards
of care at an institution; understanding and respecting religious and
cultural differences that affect requests for or refusal of treatments;
defining limits of therapy based on assessments of medical futility; recognizing the moral equivalence of not starting an ineffective treatment
and stopping (although the two acts may seem very different to families
and even to clinicians); and controversies such as withholding medically administered nutrition and hydration.

Transitioning the Goals of Care

Most acutely ill children who die in an intensive care unit do so after a decision has been made to forgo or withdraw life-­sustaining medical treatment (LSMT), and the same may apply in the chronically ill population.
LSMT is justified when the anticipated benefit outweighs the burdens to
the patient; it is important to note that the availability of technology does
not in and of itself obligate its use. Decisions to use, limit, or withdraw
LSMT should be made after careful consideration of all pertinent factors
recognizable by both family and medical staff, including medical likelihood of particular outcomes, burdens on the patient and family, religious
and cultural decision-­making frameworks, and input by the patient when
possible (Table 6.1). Although fear of legal repercussions may sometimes
drive treatment and medical advice, ultimately decisions should be based
on what is thought to be best for the patient.
The concept of futility has been used to support unilateral forgoing of
LSMT against the wishes of patients and families by holding that clinicians
should not provide futile (or useless) interventions. If medical futility is
defined narrowly as the impossibility of achieving a desired physiologic
outcome, forgoing a particular intervention is ethically justified. However,
this approach may not adequately engage professionals and families in
understanding facts and values that might allow the same therapy to reach
other goals and may leave medical and family stakeholders in permanent
conflict. Guidance from critical care groups recommend restricting use of
the word futility to situations of strict physiologic futility, and instead use
process guidelines to evaluate and manage situations of potentially inappropriate treatment. If agreement cannot be reached through clear and
compassionate communication efforts, further input should be sought
from an ethics consultant or committee.
Communication about life-­threatening or life-­altering illness is challenging and requires skills learned through both modeling and practice.
These skills include choosing a setting conducive to what may become one
or more long conversations; listening carefully to children’s and families’
hopes, fears, understanding, and expectations; explaining medical information and uncertainties simply and clearly without complicated terms
and concepts; conveying concern and openness to discussion; and being
willing to share the burdens of decision-­making with families by giving
clear recommendations. Discussing difficult topics with children requires
an understanding of child development and can be aided by professionals
such as child psychologists or child life specialists. Such conversations and
their outcomes have a major impact on the future care of the patient, on

Table 6.1  Approach to Termination of Medical Treatments for Adults (≥18 yr) and Children
CONSIDERATION

DISCUSSION

Is there a legal right to refuse medical interventions?

YES. The U.S. Supreme Court declared that competent patients ≥18 yr have a
constitutionally protected right to refuse unwanted medical treatments.
NO. In neonates and children, if the treatment is in the best interest of the
child, the family cannot refuse beneficial treatments (see later).

What interventions can be legally and ethically terminated?

Any and all interventions (including respirators, antibiotics, pacemakers,
ECMO, intravenous or enteral nutrition and hydration) can be legally and
ethically terminated.

Is there a difference between withholding life-­sustaining
­interventions and withdrawing them?

NO. The consensus is that there is no legal or ethical difference between
withholding and withdrawing medical interventions. Stopping a treatment
once begun is just as ethical as never having started it.

Whose view about terminating life-­sustaining interventions
­prevails if there is a conflict between the family and physician?

If continued treatment is not beneficial (futile), there is no obligation to
continue such care. At times, involvement of an ethics committee or the
courts is necessary. In most circumstances, the parents agree with the
healthcare team (shared decision-­making).

Are advance care directives legally enforceable?

YES. As a clear expression of the patient’s wishes, they are a constitutionally
protected method for patients to exercise their right to refuse medical
treatments. In almost all states, clear and explicit oral statements are legally
and ethically sufficient for decisions about withholding or withdrawing
medical interventions. This is true for patients over 18 yr old. Mature,
competent adolescents (≥16 yr) may provide assent and consent to refuse
care, but this is not universally accepted.

families, and on medical staff. For this reason, ongoing evaluation of goals
and communication about them is needed with families and within complex medical teams as the course of the illness unfolds.
Experts recognize that good medical care involves providing for communication, symptom management, and a range of supportive services
from the onset of acute illness. In this way, if an illness proves to be life-­
limiting despite intensive therapies, the elements of palliative care are
already in place. This concept has had difficulty gaining traction, especially in critical care settings, because of the mistaken conflation of broadly
defined palliative measures with hospice care. Palliative care interventions focus on the relief of symptoms and conditions that may detract
from quality of life regardless of the impact on a child’s underlying disease process, and as such are important whether care is focused on cure
or on transitioning to end-­of-­life care (see Chapter 8). Some interventions
regarded as life-­sustaining, such as chemotherapy, may be ethically acceptable in the end-­of-­life setting if their use decreases pain and suffering.

Withholding and Withdrawing Life-­Sustaining
Treatment

Limitation of interventions or withdrawal of existing therapies is ethically permissible if congruent with a plan of care focused on comfort
and improved quality at the end of life rather than cure. The prevailing view in Western medical ethics is that there is no moral distinction between withholding or withdrawing interventions that are not
medically indicated (see Table 6.1). Uncertainty in predicting a child’s
response to treatment may drive the initiation and continuation of
interventions that are subsequently determined to be no longer aligned
with the goals of care. It is important to continually evaluate the results
of these treatments and the evolution of the illness to recognize whether
such interventions continue to be the best medical and moral choices.
Maintaining the focus on the child rather than on the interests of parents or medical staff should be the primary driver of decision-­making.
The decision about whether to attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR) may become an issue to discuss with parents of children living with
life-­threatening or terminal conditions. All elements of end-­of-­life care
approaches, including resuscitation status, should be supportive of agreed­on goals of care. It is imperative that decisions and plans are effectively communicated to all caregivers in order to avoid denying medically effective
interventions and measures to ensure comfort. Orders about resuscitation
status should clarify the plan regarding intubation and mechanical ventilation, the use of cardiac medications, chest compressions, cardioversion,

blood products, antibiotics, and dialysis. Because goals of care may change
over time, a medical order regarding resuscitation is not irrevocable. Clinicians may assume that the absence of a do-­not-­attempt-­resuscitation
(DNAR) order obligates them to perform CPR. This action may not be
ethically obligatory if resuscitative efforts will not achieve the desired physiologic end-­point. In all cases, treatments should be tailored to the child’s
clinical condition, balancing benefits and burdens to the patient. Resuscitation should not be performed solely to mollify parental distress at the
tragic time of the loss of their child.

Artificial Hydration and Nutrition

Issues surrounding withholding or withdrawing artificial hydration and
nutrition are controversial, and interpretations are affected by parental religious and medical beliefs. Any adult or child who is fully dependent on the
care of others will die as a result of not receiving hydration and nutrition.
Case law has supported the withholding of artificially administered nutrition and hydration in the setting of adult vegetative or permanently unconscious patients who can be shown to have previously expressed a wish not
to be maintained in such a state. This requires a valid advance directive or
for a surrogate decision maker to speak on behalf of the patient’s known
wishes. Because infants and many children have not reached a developmental stage in which such discussions would have been possible, decisions about stopping artificially administered nutrition and hydration as
a limitation of treatment are more problematic. These decisions should
be based on what families and caregivers decide best support comfort. In
the child who is imminently dying, unaware of hunger, does not tolerate
enteral feedings, and in whom family and staff agree that IV nutrition and
hydration only prolong the dying process, it may be ethically permissible to
withhold or withdraw these treatments based on a benefit-­burden analysis.

The Doctrine of Double Effect

Treatment decisions at the end of life may include limitations of certain
LSMT or may involve the use of analgesic or sedative medications that
some fear may shorten life, thereby causing death. The doctrine of double
effect (DDE) holds that an action with both good and bad effects is morally
justifiable if the good effect is the only one intended and the bad effect is
foreseen and accepted, but not desired. In pediatrics, DDE is most commonly applied in end-­of-­life cases when upward titration of medication
(opiates) necessary to relieve pain, anxiety, or air hunger can be expected
to result in a degree of respiratory depression. In such cases, meeting a
clinician’s obligation to relieve suffering is the intended effect, and this

Chapter 6 u Ethics in Pediatric Care

obligation to the patient outweighs the acknowledged but unavoidable side
effect. Choosing medications that adequately relieve symptoms with minimal adverse effects would be ethically preferable, but absent these options,
the obligation to provide comfort at the end of life outweighs the foreseeable occurrence of unavoidable side effects. Hastening death as a primary
intention is not considered to be morally acceptable.
Providing pain medication guided by the DDE should not be confused with active euthanasia. The distinction is clear:
• In active euthanasia, causing death is chosen as a means of relieving
the symptoms that cause suffering.
• Under DDE, adequate management of pain, anxiety, or air hunger
is recognized as an obligation to dying patients and is provided by
careful titration of medications in response to symptoms. If death
occurs sooner as a result, this is accepted.
In both cases the patient dies, and in both cases suffering ends, but
immediate death is the intended consequence only in the case of euthanasia. Codes of ethics and legislation in many states support the obligation to provide pain and symptom relief at the end of life, even if this
requires increasing doses of medication.

about outcomes and options, detailed discussion of organ donation should
be done by other individuals who are specifically trained for this purpose.
This decoupling of clinical decision-­making from a request for organ
donation by trained individuals, perhaps by providing families with expert
information without a perceived conflict of interest, has been associated
with improved donation rates.

NEONATAL ETHICS

Differences in religious beliefs or cultural norms may lead to conflict
among patients, families, and medical caregivers over the approach to
medical care. Pediatricians need to remain sensitive to and maintain an
attitude of respect for these differences yet recognize that an independent
obligation exists to provide safe and effective medical treatment to the
child. An adult with decision-­making capacity is recognized as having the
right to refuse treatment on religious or cultural grounds, but children who
have not yet developed this capacity are considered a vulnerable population with a right to treatment. In situations that threaten the life of the child
or that may result in substantial harm, legal intervention should be sought
if reasonable efforts toward collaborative decision-­making are ineffective.
If a child’s life is imminently threatened, medical intervention is ethically
justified despite parental objections.

As neonatal care has evolved, the limits of viability of extremely premature
infants are continuing to change. This introduces new elements of uncertainty to decision-­making, often in emotionally fraught circumstances
such as a precipitous premature delivery. In cases of uncertain prognosis,
parental desires should determine the decision-­making, while clinicians
should help parents recognize when treatments are inappropriate; this
should result in a shared decision-­making approach to developing plans
of care.
The federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of
1984 (CAPTA), which became known as “Baby Doe Regulations,”
required state child protective services agencies to develop and
implement mechanisms to report to a specific government agency
treatment that the reporter believed was withheld from infants
on the basis of disability. Exceptions were (1) an infant is chronically and irreversibly comatose; (2) if providing a treatment would
merely prolong dying, would not be effective in ameliorating or
correcting all the infant’s life-­threatening conditions, or would be
futile in terms of the infant’s survival; and (3) if the treatment would
be virtually futile and inhumane. This legislation pertains only to
infants and is intended to prevent discrimination on the basis of
disability alone. One consequence of the legislation was a shift from
potential undertreatment to widespread overtreatment (LSMT that
does not serve the interests of the child) of severely disabled newborns. As parental involvement in decision-­making is again taking
a more central role, and as palliative care approaches in infants have
become more available and skilled, balanced approaches to valuing
the lives of disabled infants should be considered. Understanding
institutional, regional, state, and national regulations related to care
of infants is important in order to practice within regulatory frameworks while respecting the values of the family and pursuing the
interests of the patient.
Active euthanasia of severely suffering disabled newborns has been legalized in The Netherlands and Belgium, using protocols designed to minimize the risk of abuse and maximize transparency. It is currently illegal in
the United States, and although controversy surrounds the subject, the
predominant view is that active euthanasia is not ethically acceptable in the
care of infants and children, instead favoring palliative treatment (including
pain management) and limiting escalation of treatment (see Chapter 8).

DECLARING DEATH AND ORGAN DONATION

Donation of solid organs necessary to support life can occur after a patient
is declared dead based on either irreversible cessation of function of the
brain and brainstem (death by neurologic criteria, or brain death) or a predetermined period of cardiac asystole called circulatory death (see Chapter
83). To avoid a potential conflict of interest by surgeons or others caring
for a potential organ recipient, the request for organ donation should be
separated from the clinical discussion of either brain death or withdrawal
of LSMT. Although clinicians may be the first to enter discussion about
death and organ donation with family members during conversations

Death by Neurologic Criteria

Death by neurologic criteria (DNC), commonly referred to as brain death
(BD), may be difficult for families to understand when the child appears to
be breathing (although on a ventilator), pink, and warm to the touch and
when language such as “life support” is used at the bedside by staff. Studies
also document clinician misunderstanding of the diagnosis of BD/DNC.
For these reasons, strict criteria adhering to nationally accepted guidelines must be used to determine when irreversible cessation of brain and
brainstem function (coma, brainstem areflexia, apnea) has occurred and
adequately document these findings (see Chapter 83).

RELIGIOUS OR CULTURAL OBJECTIONS TO
TREATMENT

PEDIATRIC ETHICS COMMITTEES AND ETHICS
CONSULTATION

Most hospitals have institutional ethics committees to assist with policy
development, education, and case consultation. When these committees
serve institutions caring for children, they may be referred to as pediatric ethics committees. Because of the important differences in approach
between adult and pediatric ethics, member expertise on this committee
should include those with special insight into the unique ethical issues
arising in the care of children. Such committees generally provide ethics consultation advice without mandating action or being determinative. For the vast majority of decisions involving the medical treatment
of children (including forgoing LSMT), pediatric clinicians and parents
are in agreement about the desirability of the proposed intervention.
Because of the ethical importance of assent, the views of older children
should also be given considerable weight.
Pediatric ethics committees typically perform at least three different functions: (1) the drafting and review of institutional policy on
such issues as DNAR orders and forgoing LSMT, (2) the education of
healthcare professionals, patients, and families about ethical issues in
healthcare, and (3) case consultation and conflict resolution. Although
the process of case consultation may vary, ideally the committee (or
consultant) should adopt a collaborative approach that uncovers all
the readily available and relevant facts, considers the values of those
involved, and balances the relevant interests, while arriving at a recommendation based on a consistent ethical analysis. One helpful approach
involves consideration of the 4 following elements: (1) medical indications, (2) patient preferences, (3) quality of life, and (4) contextual features. Another framework based on principles would suggest attention
to respect for persons, beneficence/nonmaleficence, and justice.
Pediatric ethics committees often play a constructive role when
parents and medical staff cannot agree on the proper course of action.
Over the past several decades, these committees have acquired considerable influence and are increasingly recognized by state courts as
an important aid in decision-­making. The membership, policies, and
procedures of a pediatric ethics committee should conform to accepted
professional standards.

54 Part I u The Field of Pediatrics
NEWBORN SCREENING

The Oxford Dictionary of Public Health defines screening as “the
identification of a previously unrecognized disease or disease precursor, using procedures or tests that can be conducted rapidly and economically on large numbers of people with the aim of sorting them
into those who may have the condition(s) … and those who are free
from evidence of the condition(s).” Several programs, such as newborn screening for inborn errors of metabolism (see Chapter 104; e.g.,
phenylketonuria and hypothyroidism), are rightly counted among the
triumphs of contemporary pediatrics. The success of such programs
sometimes obscures serious ethical issues that continue to arise in proposals to screen for other conditions for which the benefits, risks, and
costs have not been clearly established. Advances in genetics and technology have led to exponential growth in the number of conditions
for which screening programs might be considered, with insufficient
opportunity to study each proposed testing program (see Chapter 95).
The introduction of screening efforts should be done in a carefully controlled manner that allows for the evaluation of the costs (financial, medical, and psychologic) and benefits of screening, including the effectiveness
of follow-­up and treatment protocols. New programs should be considered
experimental until the risks and benefits can be carefully evaluated. Screening tests that identify candidates for treatment must have demonstrated
sensitivity, specificity, and high predictive value, lest individuals be falsely
labeled and subject to possibly toxic treatments or to psychosocial risks. As
newborn screening tests are being developed, parents should be given the
opportunity to exercise informed parental permission or refusal. However,
once a particular screening test has been clearly demonstrated to benefit
the individual or public health, a formal, active parental permission process may not be ethically obligatory.
A persistent ethical issue is whether screening should be (1) voluntary (“opt in”), (2) routine, with the ability to “opt out” or refuse,
or (3) mandatory. A voluntary approach entails an informed decision by parents before screening. Concern is often expressed that
seeking parental permission is ethically misguided for tests of
clear benefit, such as phenylketonuria screening, because refusal
would constitute neglect. Routine testing with an opt-­out approach
requires an explicit refusal of screening by parents who object to
this intervention. The principal ethical justification for mandatory
screening is the claim that society’s obligation to promote child welfare through early detection and treatment of selected conditions
supersedes any parental right to refuse this simple and low-­risk
medical intervention. Parental permission is clearly required when
there is a research agenda (i.e., for incorporating experimental tests
into established screening programs).

GENETICS, GENOMICS, AND PRECISION MEDICINE

Genetics refers to the study of particular genes, and genomics
describes the entirety of an individual’s genetic material. Genomics has
been made possible by technologic advances that allowed the rapid and
inexpensive sequencing now used in clinical care. The development of
precision medicine is in large part predicated on genomic science and
may have a major impact on the practice of pediatrics in the future.
Efforts to undertake whole-­genome sequencing of newborns may yield
actionable information to benefit the child, but also carry the risk of
stigmatization, false positives, and unwanted information that could
lead to anxiety and psychologic distress.
Genetic testing of young children for late-­onset disorders such as the
BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancer risk genes has also been the subject
of some ethical controversy. Knowledge of increased risk status may
lead to lifestyle changes that can reduce morbidity and the risk of mortality or may precipitate adverse emotional and psychologic responses
and discrimination. Because many adults choose not to be tested for
late-­onset disorders, one cannot assume that a child would want or
will benefit from similar testing. Genetic testing of young children for
late-­onset disorders is generally inappropriate unless such testing will
result in interventions that have been shown to reduce morbidity and
mortality when initiated in childhood. Otherwise, such testing should
be deferred until the child has the capacity to make an informed and
voluntary choice.

Precision medicine promises to enhance treatment and public health
outcomes in the future. Yet the success of precision medicine will
depend on whose data are used to develop and refine artificial intelligence algorithms that will inform care. A large body of literature has
begun to explore racial and ethnic disparities in precision medicine,
with the goal of ensuring advances will benefit all people. However,
children represent another group that is at risk of exclusion from these
benefits. Historically, the rarity of many childhood illnesses, protective
regulations, and financial disincentives have limited the development
of effective treatments for many childhood diseases. Legislation such as
the “Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity for Children Act” (RACE
Act) has begun to mandate greater representation of children in clinical trials. If similar steps are not taken in pediatric precision medicine,
we run the risk of creating a new generation of therapeutic orphans.

ADOLESCENT HEALTHCARE
Adolescent Assent and Consent

Many adolescents are more like adults than children in their capacity to
understand healthcare issues and to relate them to their life goals (see
Chapter 150). Teenagers may lack legally defined competency, yet they
may have developed the capacity to meet the elements of informed consent for many aspects of medical care (see Chapter 151). There are also
public health reasons for allowing adolescents to consent to their own
healthcare with regard to reproductive decisions, such as contraception, abortion, and treatment of sexually transmitted infections. Strict
requirements for parental permission may deter adolescents from
seeking healthcare, with serious implications for their health and other
community interests.
Counterbalancing these arguments are legitimate parental interests
to maintain responsibility and authority for child rearing, including
the opportunity to influence the sexual attitudes and practices of their
children. Others claim that access to treatment such as contraception, abortion, or needle exchange programs implicitly endorses sexual activity or drug use during adolescence. Pediatricians should not
impose their own moral beliefs in these disputes. Rather, they should
provide unbiased evidence-­
based information and nonjudgmental
support. One guiding principle should be encouragement of children
and adolescents to begin taking responsibility, with guidance, for their
own health. This requires some input from parents or guardians but
also some privacy during decision-­
making as adolescents achieve
developmentally anticipated separation from parental control.

Communication, Privacy, and Confidentiality

Exchanging information is a core function of communication in
pediatric and adolescent care. As adolescents mature, their need to
exchange information about sensitive topics can increase, complicating the triadic clinician-­parent-­child relationship. For example, adolescents might wish to start oral contraception or seek treatment for a
sexually transmitted infection without their parents’ knowledge. The
confidentiality of conversations about reproductive health and sexually
transmitted infections between adolescents and clinicians is often protected by state laws, although the scope of protections in these laws varies widely. A recent federal law that mandates increased transparency
in medical care will further complicate this sensitive communication.
The 21st Century Cures Act included a rule that requires healthcare organizations to provide electronic health information (EHI) to
patients in easily accessible platforms. This mandate went into effect
in April 2021. As a result of this law, adolescents now have access to
their EHI. For preadolescent patients, healthcare organizations provide
proxy access to parents. When children reach adolescence, approaches
to provision of EHI access vary greatly. Some sites allow parental access
to adolescent EHI that has been filtered for confidential information.
Other sites revoke parental access, but allow adolescents the option of
permitting proxy consent. Still other sites permanently revoke parental
access once a child has reached adolescence. This new transparency
will likely provide benefits, but could also generate new ethical risks
to preserving the confidentiality of adolescent patients. Pediatricians
must be cognizant of this tension when creating clinical documentation that might be visible to parents and adolescent patients.

Chapter 6 u Ethics in Pediatric Care
Chronic Illness

The normal process of adolescent development involves gradually separating from parents, establishing self-­confidence, asserting individuality,
developing strong peer relationships, solidifying an ability to function independently outside the family, and taking on increasing autonomy in healthcare decisions. Most developmentally typical children older than age 14
years understand the implications of well-­explained medical options as well
as the average adult, and their input into their own care should be respected.
For children living with chronic illness, the ability to make medical decisions
for themselves may either occur earlier than for those who have been previously healthy or may occur later if, because of illness, they have not been
able to achieve normal developmental milestones or psychologic maturity.
The clinician’s role involves assessment of the individual adolescent patient’s
ability to understand the medical situation, to support the patient’s efforts to
express wishes regarding medical treatment, to value and encourage parental support and involvement, and to foster cooperation and mutual understanding. This may be difficult in situations in which parents and adolescents
disagree about life-­sustaining treatments such as organ transplantation or
chemotherapy, but many such conflicts may be resolved by exploring the
reasons for the disagreement. Overriding an adolescent’s wishes should be
done very infrequently and only after careful consideration of the potential
consequences of unwanted interventions.

Decisions in Terminally Ill Adolescents

Most adolescents share end-­of-­life decision-­making with family members,
although communication may be challenging because of a growing sense
of independence. Open communication and flexibility about treatment
preferences may help teens cope with fears and uncertainties. Development of an age-­appropriate advance directive may support the patient’s
emerging autonomy by clarifying the adolescent’s wishes while fostering
a collaborative process among the patient, family, and medical caregivers.
From the time of diagnosis of a life-­threatening condition through the
end-­of-­life phase, children should be included in a developmentally tailored process of communication and shared decision-­making that builds
a foundation of mutual respect and trust. Some experts believe that most
adolescents are not yet fully capable of making a decision to forgo life-­
sustaining treatment. Careful case-­by-­case evaluation is required to make
this determination, and assistance from developmental psychologists and
ethics consultants may be helpful.

RESEARCH

The central ethical challenge of pediatric research is the need to balance
protection of children from research risk against the ethical imperative of
conducting studies to better the lives of future children. Research is defined
in the federal regulations as “a systematic investigation designed to develop
or contribute to generalizable knowledge.” For any research to be performed, the risks should be minimized and reasonable with respect to any
anticipated benefits to the participants and the importance of the resulting
knowledge. That some children derive a direct benefit from participation
in research must also be considered, making it important to distinguish
research with the prospect of direct benefit from nontherapeutic pediatric
research. Because children are a vulnerable population, there are restrictions
on the research risks to which a child may be exposed, in contrast to the
risk level acceptable for research with consenting adults. These restrictions
function by limiting the type of research that institutional review boards
(IRBs) are permitted to approve and by specifying the conditions under
which parents have the moral and legal authority to permit a child to participate in research.
Nontherapeutic research in children is the most ethically controversial because it holds no expected direct benefit for the individual.
The prohibition against using a person (especially a child) solely as a
means to an end has led some to argue that children should never be
used in nontherapeutic research. The more widely held opinion is that
children may be exposed to a limited degree of risk with IRB approval,
parental permission, and assent if the child is capable. The federal regulations allow healthy children to participate in minimal-­risk research
regardless of the potential benefit to the child. More controversially, the
regulations also state that children with a disorder or condition may be
exposed to slightly more than minimal risk in nontherapeutic research
if the child’s experience is similar to everyday life with the condition and

55

the anticipated knowledge is of vital importance for understanding the
condition.
In pediatric research with the prospect of direct benefit, the risks must
be justified by the anticipated benefit to the child, and the balance of anticipated benefit to the risk should be at least as favorable as that presented by
available alternatives. In our opinion, the welfare of an individual child must
always come before the scientific goals of the research study.
U.S. regulations for the protection of human research participants rest
on two foundations: (1) independent review of the ethics and science of
the research by an IRB before (2) voluntary and informed consent of the
participant. Although it is not amenable to regulation, the integrity of the
investigator is probably the most important element contributing to the
protection of human research participants. The standard for informed
consent in a research setting is higher than for clinical care because the
risks and benefits are typically less clear, the investigator has a conflict of
interest, and humans have historically been subjected to unauthorized
risks when strict requirements for consent were not respected.
Adolescents who are competent may sometimes consent to be research
participants. Younger children may participate in a process of assent, but
this does not imply that a child’s signature on an assent document is necessarily a legal or ethical requirement. Children should be given the opportunity to dissent, particularly for nontherapeutic research, when there
cannot be a claim that participation is in the child’s interest. In the United
States, national regulations require that reasonable efforts be made at least
to inform children who are capable of understanding that participation is
not part of their care, and therefore they are free to refuse to participate. In
the rare case that the research offers a direct benefit to the child that would
not otherwise be available, the regulations do not require child assent but
only parental permission.
In addition to the protection that informed consent or parental
permission is intended to provide, virtually all research involving
humans in the United States is reviewed by an IRB, as required by
federal regulations for institutions receiving federal research funds
and for drug research regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. For research that carries more than a minor increase
over minimal risk without prospect of benefit to the child such
that a local IRB cannot provide approval, there is a process for federal review of research that “presents a reasonable opportunity to
further the understanding, prevention, or alleviation of a serious
problem affecting the health or welfare of children.” Ultimately, the
U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services has the authority to
approve such research.

JUSTICE AND PEDIATRIC ETHICS

The most serious ethical problem in U.S. healthcare may be inequality in access to healthcare. Children are particularly vulnerable to
this disparity, and pediatricians have a moral obligation to advocate
for children as a class. Because children do not vote and do not have
financial resources at their disposal, they are subject to a greater
risk of being uninsured or underinsured. This lack of adequate and
affordable healthcare has serious consequences in terms of death,
disability, and suffering. The per capita proportion of healthcare
funding spent on adults greatly exceeds that spent on children, and
Medicare is available to all adults who turn 65 years old, whereas
Medicaid is limited to those beneath a specific income level. Pediatricians should be familiar with policy issues around the economics
of child healthcare so that they will be better able to advocate for
their own patients.
Beyond access to healthcare, structural social inequalities also have profound impacts on child health and well-­being. Systemic racism and structural
disadvantages can affect every aspect of pediatric care, from infant mortality
and neonatal care delivery to asthma outcomes and surgical complications.
Furthermore, social inequality and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs)
have been linked to greater incidence of chronic diseases, substance abuse,
increased encounters with the justice system, and lower executive functioning. Pediatricians should take active steps to acknowledge and attempt to
mitigate the effect of these inequalities on their patients through individual,
local, and national advocacy efforts.

Complementary Therapies
and Integrative Medicine
Paula M. Gardiner and Caitlin M. Neri
Integrative medicine focuses on promoting physical, mental, emotional,
spiritual, social, and educational well-­being in the context of a medical
home in a healthy family and community. The foundations of integrative medicine are health-­promoting practices such as optimal nutrition
and dietary supplements to prevent deficiencies, avoidance of addictive
substances (e.g., nicotine, illicit drugs), physical activity, adequate sleep, a
healthy environment, and supportive social relationships. Evidence-­based
complementary therapies such as dietary supplements, massage, chiropractic, other forms of bodywork, yoga, meditation practices, hypnosis,
guided imagery, biofeedback, and acupuncture may also be used.
Not including multivitamins and mineral supplements such as iron
and calcium, an estimated 10–40% of healthy children and >50% of
children with chronic conditions use integrative medicine in the United
States. The prevalence could be even higher because these treatments
usually occur without disclosure to the children’s primary care physician. Common therapies include dietary supplements, deep breathing,
guided imagery, meditation, biofeedback, hypnosis, yoga, acupuncture,
massage, and aromatherapy.
Use of complementary therapies is most common among youth with
chronic, incurable, or recurrent conditions such as cancer, depression and
other mental health conditions, asthma, autism, headaches, abdominal
pain, and other chronic painful conditions. In a 2017 study of freestanding
children’s hospitals, 92% offered complementary services, 38% had a specific complementary center on-­site, and 60% had policies related to supplement use during hospitalization. Integrative therapies are being used in
pediatric cancer symptom management and chronic pain clinics. Practice
often includes supplements (e.g., probiotics) and mind-­body techniques
(e.g., hypnotherapy, biofeedback) with traditional medical management
for these common pediatric conditions.

DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS

Under the 1994 U.S. Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act,
a dietary supplement is a product taken by mouth that contains a
dietary ingredient intended to supplement the diet. These may include
vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanical, amino acids, and substances such as enzymes, organ tissues, glands, and metabolites.
Dietary supplements are the most frequently used complementary
therapies for children and adolescents (Table 7.1). Some uses are
common and recommended, such as vitamin D supplements for
breastfed infants and probiotics to prevent antibiotic-­associated diarrhea, whereas other uses are more controversial, such as using herbal
products to treat otitis media.
In the United States, dietary supplements do not undergo the same
stringent evaluation and postmarketing surveillance as prescription
medications. Although they may not claim to prevent or treat specific medical conditions, product labels may make structure-­function
claims. A label may claim that a product “promotes a healthy immune
system,” but it may not claim to cure the common cold.
According to the 2017–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 34% of children and adolescents used any
dietary supplement in the past 30 days, with multivitamin-­mineral
products the most common (24%). Use of dietary supplements is most
common among children whose families have higher income and education and whose parents use supplements, among older children, and
among those with chronic conditions.
Despite this widespread use, many patients and their parents who
use dietary supplements do not talk with their physician about their

use. Several guidelines have called for more complete dietary supplement history taking by healthcare professionals. The Joint Commission
recommends that this information be included in the medication reconciliation process.

DIETARY SUPPLEMENT SAFETY

Dietary supplements may have safety issues in children, but toxicity
is much less common with nonprescription dietary supplements than
with prescription medications. Toxicity depends on dose, use of other
therapies, and the child’s underlying medical condition (see Table
94.20). Current use of a dietary supplement (e.g., ephedra for weight
loss) may not reflect its traditional use (e.g., ephedra as a component
of a traditional Chinese medicine tea in small doses to improve allergic
or respiratory symptoms). Moreover, herbs that are apparently safe for
most adults may be more hazardous in specific conditions (e.g., newborns, patients with impaired renal or hepatic function), under special
circumstances (e.g., after organ transplantation or other surgery), or
when combined with prescription medications. Some natural products
are toxic in and of themselves. Even when a product is safe when used
correctly, it can cause mild or severe toxicity when used incorrectly.
Although peppermint is a commonly used and usually benign gastrointestinal spasmolytic included in after-­dinner mints, it can exacerbate
gastroesophageal reflux.

Chapter 7 u Complementary Therapies and Integrative Medicine
Although there are good manufacturing practices for dietary supplements in the United States, dietary supplement labels might not accurately
reflect the contents or concentrations of ingredients. Because of natural
variability, variations of 10-­fold to 1,000-­fold have been reported for several popular herbs, even across lots produced by the same manufacturer.
Herbal products may be contaminated with pesticides or microbial agents
or toxins, or the wrong herb may be misidentified during harvesting.
Products from some countries (e.g., Ayurvedic products from South Asia)
might contain toxic levels of mercury, cadmium, arsenic, or lead, either
from unintentional contamination during manufacturing or from intentional additions by producers who believe that these metals have therapeutic value. Approximately 30–40% of Asian patent medicines include potent
pharmaceuticals, such as analgesics, antibiotics, hypoglycemic agents, or
corticosteroids; typically the labels for these products are not written in
English and do not note the inclusion of pharmaceutical agents. Even conventional mineral supplements, such as calcium, have been contaminated
with lead or had significant problems with product variability.
Many families use supplements concurrently with medications,
posing hazards of interactions (Table 7.2). Using the same principles
of drug-­drug interactions can help determine if a supplement-­drug
interaction is a concern. For example, St. John’s wort induces CYP3A4
activity of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system and thus can enhance
elimination of most drugs that use this pathway, including digoxin,
cyclosporine, protease inhibitors, oral contraceptives, and numerous
antibiotics, leading to subtherapeutic serum levels.

DIETARY SUPPLEMENT EFFICACY

Evidence about the effectiveness of dietary supplements to prevent or
treat pediatric problems is mixed, depending on the product used and
condition treated. Some herbal products may be helpful adjunctive
treatments for common childhood problems; some herbs have proved
helpful for colic (fennel and the combination of chamomile, fennel,
vervain, licorice, and balm mint), nausea (ginger), irritable bowel syndrome (peppermint), and diarrhea (probiotics).

MASSAGE AND CHIROPRACTIC

Massage is usually provided at home by parents and in clinical settings by
professional massage therapists, physical therapists, and nurses. Infant
massage is routinely provided in many neonatal intensive care units to
promote growth and development in preterm infants. Massage also has
been demonstrated to be beneficial for pediatric patients with asthma,
insomnia, colic, cystic fibrosis, or juvenile arthritis and patients undergoing cancer therapy. Massage therapy is generally safe. Professional massage practice is regulated by state government and may be in the form of a

57

license, registration, or certification. More than 44 states license massage
therapists, with licensure being the strictest form of regulation, making
it illegal for any nonlicensed professional to practice massage therapy.
Chiropractic healthcare deals with the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disorders of the neuromusculoskeletal system and their effects
on general health. Currently, >70,000 chiropractors have licensure in the
United States, with licensure in all 50 states. Most medical insurance companies cover chiropractic care. Children and families seek chiropractic
care for common childhood conditions such as asthma, infantile colic,
nocturnal enuresis, constipation, and headache. A consensus update on
chiropractic care in children found no evidence for the effectiveness of
chiropractic care for such common childhood conditions. With respect
to safety, the evidence is also limited; however, published cases of serious adverse events in infants and children receiving chiropractic care are
rare. Unfortunately, although rare, complications of cervical manipulation
include vertebrobasilar dissection with resultant stroke and rupture of a
syringomyelia with resultant paralysis. If children and families are seeking
chiropractic care, it is appropriately done following consultation with the
child’s pediatric primary care provider to ensure patient safety. In addition,
chiropractors often give medical advice beyond their expertise; up to 30%
believe vaccines have significant side effects.

MIND-­BODY THERAPIES

Mind-­body therapies such as slow, deep breathing, meditation, guided
imagery, biofeedback, hypnosis, tai chi, and yoga are also frequently
used complementary therapies in pediatrics. These practices can be
learned informally through books, online videos, compact discs, digital video discs, smartphone apps, or classes and in therapeutic sessions
with health professionals, such as psychologists and social workers
(Table 7.3). Substantial research suggests that such practices can aid
in reducing anxiety, insomnia, and stress-­related conditions, including
migraine headaches and functional abdominal pain. These therapies
can also help patients struggling with chronic pain.

ACUPUNCTURE

Modern acupuncture incorporates treatment traditions from China,
Japan, Korea, France, and other countries. In the United States, acupuncturists are licensed to practice in 47 states. Acupuncture can be
delivered to pediatric patients in hospital and clinic settings to treat
a variety of ailments. Acupuncture is particularly useful for children
experiencing pain, and acupuncture services are offered alongside
conventional medicine and psychology by >50% of North American
academic pediatric chronic pain programs. The technique that has
undergone the most scientific study involves penetrating the skin

Although pediatric patients may be averse to needles, when
approached in a developmentally appropriate way by an acupuncturist
trained in pediatrics, children are often amenable to acupuncture and
report that it is helpful. Acupuncture can offer significant benefits in
the treatment of recurrent headache, anxiety, back and other types of
pain, depression, abdominal pain, and nausea. Infections and bleeding
are rare but can occur, and more serious complications, such as pneumothorax, occur in <1 in 30,000 treatments.

CANNABIS

Because marijuana has been legalized in many states for both recreational (adult) use and medical use, caregivers and families may inquire
about the potential health benefits of cannabis for both children and
adults. There are significant safety concerns in adolescents and young
adults, because detrimental effects of marijuana on the developing
brain have been documented. One systematic review of 90 studies,
including 9,441 adolescents and young adults, provided preliminary
evidence for functional and structural alterations in frontoparietal,
frontolimbic, frontostriatal, and cerebellar regions among adolescent
cannabis users.
It is important to note that in some children with severe refractory
epilepsy, oral cannabidiol, a nonpsychoactive component in marijuana, improves seizure control. Outside of prescription cannabidiol,
the purity and regulation of marijuana and its commercially available
component products are variable. Most of the pediatric literature on
cannabis describes an increase in accidental ingestions in young children, presumably in association with the increase in products now
available for adult use; this is an additional safety risk for pediatricians
to consider.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), “Palliative
care for children is the active total care of the child’s body, mind and
spirit and also involves giving support to the family. Optimally, this
care begins when a life-­threatening illness or condition is diagnosed
and continues regardless of whether or not a child receives treatment
directed at the underlying illness.” Provision of palliative care applies
to children with a wide variety of serious illnesses, including cancer,
cystic fibrosis, complex or severe cardiac disease, neurodegenerative
disorders, severe malformations, and trauma with life-­
threatening
sequelae (Table 8.1). Many children who benefit from integration of
palliative care approaches have complex chronic conditions and are
supported by advanced medical technology that allows them to live
longer. These children, who often survive health crises followed by the
renewed need for rehabilitative and life-­prolonging treatments, are best
served by a system that is flexible and responsive to changing needs and
blended goals of care.
Although often mistakenly understood as synonymous with end-­
of-­life care, the scope and potential benefits of palliative care are
applicable throughout the illness trajectory. Palliative care emphasizes ascertaining and aligning with goals of care, which may be congruent with maximal treatment aimed at sustaining or prolonging
life, optimization of quality of life, communication, and symptom
control.
The mandate of pediatric clinicians to attend to children’s physical, mental, and emotional health and development includes the
provision of palliative care for those who live with a significant
possibility of death before adulthood (Fig. 8.1). As such, all pediatric clinicians benefit from using basic (primary) palliative care
principles when approaching the care of children living with serious illness. At the same time, such comprehensive physical, psychologic, social, and spiritual care benefits from an interdisciplinary
approach.
The philosophy of palliative care can be successfully integrated into
any hospital setting, including the ICU, when the focus of care also
includes the prevention or amelioration of suffering and improving
comfort and quality of life. All interventions that affect the child and
family need to be assessed in relationship to these goals. This proactive
approach asks the question, “What can we offer that will improve the
quality of this child’s life and provide the most meaning and sense of
control and choice for their family?” instead of, “What therapies are we
no longer going to offer this patient?” Staff may benefit from education,
support, and guidance on the basic principles of pediatric palliative
care, while using specialty-­trained pediatric palliative care providers
when available for additional support and expertise. Regardless of the
care setting, comprehensive palliative care requires an interdisciplinary
approach that may include nurses, physicians, psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, chaplains/clergy, child life specialists, and trained
volunteers.

GOALS OF CARE AND DECISION-­MAKING

In the course of a child’s serious illness, a series of important decisions may arise in relation to location of care, medications with risks
and benefits, not starting or discontinuing life-­prolonging treatments,
experimental treatments in research protocols, and use of integrative
therapies. Guided discussions around goals of care for the child provide
opportunities to support decision-­making. This is often accomplished

by eliciting parent (and child) understanding of the child’s condition
and asking open-­ended questions that explore the parent’s and child’s
hopes, worries, and family values. Goals-­of-­care conversations include
what is most important for them as a family, considerations of their
child’s clinical condition, and their values and beliefs, including cultural, religious, and spiritual considerations (see Chapters 2 and 12).
Table 8.2 presents specific questions that can effectively guide these
discussions, and Figure 8.2 provides a basic framework illustrating
a palliative-­minded approach to care, anchored by eliciting goals of
care and aligning care with those goals. The conversation should also
include a review of previous discussions, active listening to concerns
and issues as they are raised, opportunities to repeat back elements
of the discussion to ensure clarity, and provision of honest, factual
answers even in areas of uncertainty. As a provider, it is imperative to
consider one’s own views and implicit biases before entering into discussions with families who may identify with different cultures, races,
or other social determinants (see Chapters 2, 3, and 12).
Decision-­making should be focused on the goals of care, as
opposed to limitations of care: “This is what we can offer,” instead of,
“There is nothing more we can do.” Rather than meeting specifically to
discuss discontinuing life-­prolonging therapies or a do-­not-­resuscitate
(DNR) order, a more general discussion centered on the goals of care
will naturally lead to considering which interventions are in the child’s
best interests and can present an opportunity for the clinicians to make
recommendations based on these goals. By offering medical recommendations based on family goals and the clinical reality, the team can
decrease the burden of responsibility for decision-­making that parents
carry.
Conflicts in decision-­making can occur within families, within
healthcare teams, between the child and family, and between
the family and care team (see Chapter 6). For children who are
developmentally unable to provide guidance in decision-­making
(neonates, very young children, or children with severe cognitive impairment), parents and healthcare professionals may come
to different conclusions as to what is in the child’s best interests.
Decision-­making around the care of adolescents presents specific
challenges, given the shifting boundary that separates childhood
from adulthood. In some families and cultures, open disclosure and

autonomy are secondary to maintaining the integrity of the family
(see Chapter 12). Although frequently encountered, differences in
opinion are often manageable for all involved when lines of communication are kept open, team and family meetings are held, and
the goals of care are clear.

ADVANCE CARE PLANNING

Although accurate prognostication is a particular challenge in pediatrics,
the medical team often recognizes a poor prognosis before the prognosis
is understood by parents or the child. This delay may impede informed
decision-­making about how the child lives at the end of life. Given the
inherent prognostic uncertainty of a serious, life-­threatening diagnosis,
discussions concerning resuscitation, symptom control, and end-­of-­life
care planning should be initiated when the physician recognizes that a
significant possibility of patient mortality exists. Having these conversations in the midst of a crisis is not ideal. Whenever possible, they should

occur well in advance of the crisis or when the patient has recovered
from a crisis but is at high risk for others.
Patients and families are most comfortable being cared for by physicians and other care providers with whom they have an established
relationship. Even in the face of long-­standing and highly connected
relationships, clinicians often hold assumptions about parent prognostic awareness, as well as parent readiness and willingness to have such
discussions. In an attempt to protect families, clinicians may avoid conversations they perceive as promoting distress or hopelessness. However,
parents greatly value honesty, and in fact such conversations can promote parent hopefulness and trust and connection with the care team.
At times, a consultative specialty palliative care team provides the family
with an opportunity to engage in sensitive conversations that may not as
readily occur with the primary team, at least initially.
The population of individuals who die before reaching adulthood
includes a disproportionate number of nonverbal and preverbal
children and adolescents who are developmentally unable to make
autonomous care decisions. Although parents are usually the primary
decision-­makers, these youth should be as fully involved in discussions
and decisions about their care as appropriate for their developmental
status. Using communication experts, child life therapists, chaplains,
social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists to allow children to
express themselves through art, play, music, talk, and writing will
enhance the provider’s knowledge of the child’s understanding and
hopes. Tools such as Five Wishes (for adults), Voicing My Choices (for
adolescents), and My Wishes (for school-­age children) have in practice
been useful in helping to introduce advance care planning to children,
adolescents, and their families (www.agingwithdignity.org/index.php).

Resuscitation Status

Many parents do not understand the legal mandate requiring attempted
resuscitation for cardiorespiratory arrest unless a written DNR order is
in place. In broaching this topic, rather than asking parents if they want
to forgo cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for their child (and placing the burden of decision-­making on them), discuss whether or not
resuscitative interventions are likely to benefit the child. It is important
to make recommendations based on overall goals of care and medical knowledge of potential benefit and/or harm of these interventions.
Once the goals of therapy are agreed on, the physician is required to
write a formal order. Out-­of-­hospital DNR verification forms are available which, if completed on behalf of the child, affirm that rather than
initiating resuscitative efforts, emergency response teams are obligated
to provide appropriate symptom management intended to support

Chapter 8 u Pediatric Palliative Care
comfort and relief of suffering with appropriate interventions when
called to the scene.
All states have implemented the physician orders for life treatment
(POLST) system. A POLST order is completed for children with life-­
threatening illness, creating actionable orders for interventions to pursue versus avoid based on the expressed parent’s and/or child’s wishes
(polst.org). It is usually helpful to frame discussions about POLST as
ways for parents to maintain some control by communicating their
goals and care preferences so their wishes may be honored, irrespective
of the setting. It may also be beneficial to write a letter that delineates
decisions regarding resuscitation interventions and supportive care
measures to be undertaken for the child, particularly if POLST are not
available. The letter should be as detailed as possible, including recommendations for comfort medications and contact information for the
care team best known to the patient. Such a letter, given to the parents,
with copies to the involved care team and institutions, can be a useful
communication aid, especially in times of crisis. In any case, if a child
dies in the home setting and the parents opt to use an out-­of-­hospital
DNR verification form or POLST, plans to pronounce the child and
provide support for the family must be in place. If the child has been
referred to hospice, the hospice usually fulfills those responsibilities.

CARE SETTINGS

Pediatric palliative care should be provided across settings, including
hospital, outpatient, and home, as well as pediatric nursing facilities
and sometimes inpatient hospice locations. Home care for the child
with a life-­threatening illness requires 24 hour/day access to experts in
pediatric palliative care, a team approach, and an identified coordinator
who serves as a link among hospitals, the community, and specialists
and who may assist in preventing or arranging for hospital admissions,
respite care, and increased home care support as needed based on the
child’s clinical condition and goals of care. Adequate home care support and respite care, although sorely needed, is often not readily available, given gaps in staffing or the high-­tech skills required to care for
these children. Furthermore, families may view using respite care as a
personal failure, or they may worry that others cannot adequately care
for their child’s special needs or potential rapid escalation of symptoms.
In the United States, the healthcare and reimbursement structure,
combined with frequent use of medical technology (e.g., home ventilatory support) or continuous home nursing, historically precluded
formal enrollment of children on the hospice benefit when they were
otherwise eligible (i.e., had estimated prognosis of ≤6 months). Section 2302 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA),
the Concurrent Care for Children Requirement (CCCR), eliminated
the requirement that Medicaid patients <21 years old forgo curative or
life-­prolonging therapies to be eligible for hospice. Although Medicaid
programs in every state are required to provide concurrent curative/
life-­
prolonging treatment and hospice services for hospice-­
eligible
children, development of systems to make such concurrent care a reality has been slow. A limitation of the CCCR is that it does not expand
access to hospice for children with life-­threatening illness who do not
meet hospice eligibility criteria (i.e., have a prognosis that cannot be
estimated to be <6 months) or those not receiving Medicaid.
A number of state-­based pediatric palliative care coalitions have
formed to improve access to home-­based pediatric hospice/palliative care services, using strategies such as Medicaid waivers or state
plan amendments to increase coverage for hospice services. A growing number of home care agencies have also developed palliative care
programs that serve as a bridge to hospice services for children not
yet meeting hospice eligibility criteria. Some hospices have adopted an
open hospice model with more flexible eligibility criteria. However,
provision of hospice or palliative care for children is often also limited by the availability of clinicians who have training or experience
in caring for seriously ill children. Furthermore, there are only a few
inpatient facilities in existence within the United States that provide
end-­of-­life care exclusively to pediatric patients.
At the end of life, children and families may need intensive support.
About half of pediatric deaths occur in acute care hospitals, and end-­
of-­life care may otherwise be provided in the home, pediatric nursing

61

facility, or hospice house. Families need to feel safe and well cared for
and given permission, if possible, to choose the location of care. In tertiary care hospitals, most children die in the neonatal and pediatric
ICUs. In some instances, when death at home for a child in the ICU is
preferred, transport and even extubation at home may be possible, if
clinical and logistical circumstances permit it and support it.

COMMUNICATION AND ANTICIPATORY GUIDANCE
Parents

For parents (parents defined as any primary caregivers for children),
compassionate communication with medical providers who understand their child’s illness, treatment options, and family beliefs and
goals is the cornerstone of caring for children with serious illness.
During this time, one of the most significant relationships is that with
the child’s primary care clinician, who often has an enduring relationship with the child and family, including healthy siblings. Although a
family’s goals may change with the child’s evolving clinical condition
and other variable factors, parents need to know that their child’s primary care clinician will not abandon them as the goals of care evolve.
A flexible approach rooted in ongoing communication and guidance that incorporates understanding of the family’s values, goals,
and religious, cultural, spiritual, and personal beliefs is of paramount
importance.
Pediatricians should recognize the important role they have in continuing to care for the child and family, because the primary goal of
treatment may simultaneously be prolongation of life as well as comfort, relief of suffering, and promoting quality of life. Regular meetings
between the care team and the family are essential to reassess and manage symptoms, explore the impact of illness on immediate family members, and provide anticipatory guidance. At these meetings, important
issues with lifelong implications for parents and their child may be discussed. Such discussions should be planned with care, ensuring that
adequate time for in-­depth conversation is allotted; a private, physical
setting is arranged; devices are silenced; and both parents and others
who might be identified by the family as primary supports are present. Strategies for facilitating conversations related to goals of care and
decision-­making are detailed later.
Families may look to their pediatrician for assurance that all treatment options have been explored. Assisting a patient’s family to
arrange a second opinion may be helpful. Listening to families and
children speak about the future even in the face of a poor prognosis
may help keep the focus on living even while the child may be dying.
Hoping for a miracle can coexist for parents even as they are facing
and accepting the reality of death.
Parents also need to know about the availability of home care, respite
services, web-­based support (e.g., www.courageousparentsnetwork.org),
educational materials, and support groups. Responding to parental
requests or need for counseling referrals for themselves, other children,
or the family is essential. Also, attending to the concrete needs of families (e.g., financial, insurance, housing) can be paramount in freeing
them from worries that might interfere or compete with their ability to
be fully present in their child’s care.
When closer to the patient’s end of life, although broaching the
topic may seem daunting, exploration of how parents envision their
child’s death, addressing their previous loss experiences (most often
with death of an adult relative) and any misconceptions, is often a great
relief. Learning about cultural, spiritual, and family values regarding
pain management, suffering, and the preferred place of end-­of-­life care
is essential (see Chapters 2 and 12). Even mentioning funeral arrangements, possible autopsy, and organ/tissue donation pre-­emptively can
be helpful to give parents choices and know that these considerations
can be discussed without fear. A major worry of many parents is how to
involve and communicate with siblings, as well as the child, about the
likelihood of impending death.
Ratings of “high satisfaction” with physician care have been directly
correlated with receiving clear communication around end-­of-­life
issues, delivered with sensitivity and caring; such communication
included speaking directly to the child when appropriate. Communication may be complicated by mutual protection in which the child

62 Part I u The Field of Pediatrics
wants to protect his or her parents, and likewise the parents want to
protect their child, from painful information, sadness, or fear. Honoring the uniqueness of the child and understanding and respecting the
family’s communication style, values, spirituality, and culture are critical in these highly sensitive conversations. Evidence shows that parents
who have open conversations with their child about death and dying
do not regret having done so, whereas many parents who do not engage
in these conversations regret avoiding them.
In communications with the child and family, the physician should
avoid giving specific estimates of survival length, even when the child
or family explicitly asks for them. These predictions are invariably inaccurate because population-­based statistics do not predict the course for
individual patients. A more honest approach may be to explore ranges
of time in general terms (days to weeks, weeks to months, months to
years) while recognizing that children with serious illness are also
susceptible to acute events that cause rapid deterioration. The physician can also ask parents what they might do differently if they knew
how long their child would live, then assist them in thinking through
the options relating to their specific concerns (e.g., suggest celebrating upcoming holidays or important events earlier to take advantage
of times when the child may be feeling better). It is generally wise to
suggest that relatives who wish to visit might do so earlier rather than
later, given the unpredictable trajectory of many conditions.
For the child and family, the integration of “bad news” is a process, not an event, and when done sensitively, does not take away hope
or alter the relationship between the family and physician. The physician should expect that some issues previously discussed may not be
fully resolved for the child and parents (e.g., DNR orders, artificial
nutrition or hydration) and may need to be revisited over time. Parents
of a child with a chronic illness may reject the reality of an impending
death because past predictions may not have been accurate. Whether
they are parents of a child with a chronic illness or a child whose death
is the result of an accident or sudden catastrophic illness, they may
experience great anxiety, guilt, or despair.

The Child

Truthful communication that takes into account the child’s developmental stage and unique lived experience can help to address the fear
and anxiety commonly experienced among children with serious illness. Responding in a developmentally appropriate fashion (Table 8.3)
to a child’s questions about death (e.g., “What’s happening to me?” or
“Am I dying?”) requires a careful exploration of what is already known
by the child, what is really being asked (the question behind the question), and why the question is being asked at this particular time and
in this setting. It may signal a need to be with someone who is comfortable listening to such unanswerable questions. Many children find
nonverbal expression much easier than talking; art, play therapy, and
storytelling may be more helpful than direct conversation.
A child’s perception of death depends on his or her conceptual
understanding of universality (that all things inevitably die), irreversibility (that dead people cannot come back to life), nonfunctionality
(that being dead means that all biologic functions cease), and causality
(that there are objective causes of death).
Very young children may struggle with the concepts of irreversibility and nonfunctionality. For young school-­age children, who are
beginning to understand the finality of death, worries may include
magical thinking in which their thoughts, wishes, or bad behavior
might be the underlying cause for their illness. Older children seek
more factual information to gain some control over the situation.
Children’s fears of death are often centered on the concrete fear of
being separated from parents and other loved ones and what will happen to their parents rather than themselves. This can be true for teens
and young adults as well. This fear may be responded to in different
ways: some families may give reassurance that loving relatives will be
waiting, and others use religious concepts to refer to an eternal spiritual
connection.
Adolescents may have a conceptual understanding of death similar
to that of adults, but working with the adolescent with life-­threatening
illness presents unique concerns and issues. The developmental work

of adolescence includes separating from their parents, developing
strong peer relationships, and moving toward independent adulthood.
For this population, the teenager’s developmental need to separate is
complicated by the increasing dependence both physically and emotionally on their parents. Providing space for these conversations and
communicating openly and honestly supports independence while
also meeting the adolescent’s individual need.
In addition to developmental considerations, understanding related
to the child’s life experiences, the length of the child’s illness, the understanding of the nature and prognosis of the illness, the child’s role in
the family, and the complex relationship between the child and their
parents as primary caretakers should be considered in communication
with children.
The question of whether and when to involve adolescents in
decision-­making arises particularly often. There is no one answer to
this question. Instead, numerous considerations should be taken into
account, including the adolescent’s chronological age, developmental
stage, adolescent preference with regard to such participation, and the
family’s preferred approach to communication and decision-­making.
Parents have an instinctive and strong desire to protect their children from harm. When facing the death of their child, many parents attempt to keep the reality of impending death hidden from
their child, hoping the child can be protected from the harsh reality. Although it is important to respect parental wishes, it is also true
that most children already have a sense of what is happening to their
bodies, even when it has been purposely left unspoken. Children may
blame themselves for their illness and the resulting hardships for their
loved ones. Perpetuating the myth that “everything is going to be all
right” takes away the chance to explore fears and provide reassurance.
Assisting parents to understand that the key to honest communication is not telling a child he or she is dying, but opening the door
to conversation and validating what the child already knows. Honest
communication also allows opportunities for memory and legacy making and saying goodbye.
School is the work of childhood and adolescence and is important in
optimizing quality of life for a child seeking normalcy in the face of illness. Finding ways to help children and their families to maintain these
connections through modification of the school day and exploring
options to promote educational and social connections into the home
or into the hospital room can be meaningful in the event that a child
is not well enough to attend school. Video conferencing can be readily
arranged from almost any setting.

The Siblings

Siblings are at special risk both during their sibling’s illness and after
the death. Because of the extraordinary demands placed on parents to
meet the needs of their ill child, healthy siblings may feel their own
needs are not being acknowledged or fulfilled. These feelings of neglect
may then trigger guilt about their own good health and resentment
toward their parents and ill sibling. Younger siblings may react to the
stress by becoming seemingly oblivious to the turmoil around them.
Some younger siblings may feel guilty for wishing the affected child
would die so they could get their parents back (magical thinking). Parents need to know that these are normal responses, and siblings should
be encouraged to maintain the typical routines of daily living. Siblings
who are most involved with their sick sibling before death usually
adjust better both at the time of and after the death. Acknowledging
and validating sibling feelings, being honest and open, and appropriately involving them in the life of their sick sibling provide a good foundation for the grief process. It is often helpful to identify a person in the
family (e.g., caring aunt) or school (e.g., counselor) to offer confidential
and supportive opportunities for the sibling to reflect on their family
experience, particularly as parents may be too overwhelmed to provide
this at crucial times.

The Staff

Inadequate support for the staff providing palliative care can result
in depression, emotional withdrawal, and other symptoms. Offering
educational opportunities and emotional support in the form of both

DEVELOPMENTAL
UNDERSTANDING
OF DEATH

STRATEGIES AND
RESPONSES

Child may have “sense” that
something is wrong. Death is
often viewed as continuous with
life (analogous to being awake
and being asleep).

Optimize comfort and consistency; familiar
persons, objects, routines. Use soothing
songs, words, and touch.
“I will always love you.”
“I will always take care of you.”
“I will tickle you forever.”

Concepts are simple and
­reversible.
Variations between reality and
fantasy.

Child may see death as temporary
and reversible and not universal.
Child may feel responsible for
illness.
Death may be perceived as an
external force that can get you.

Assure child that illness is not their fault.
Provide a consistent care team.
Promote honest, simple language.
Use books to explain the life cycle and
promote questions and answers.
“You did not do anything to cause this.”
“You are so special to us, and we will
always love you.”
“We know (God, Jesus, Grandma,
­Grandpa) are waiting to see you.”

Child begins to demonstrate
organized, logical thought.
Thinking becomes less esoteric.
Child begins to problem-­solve
concretely, reason logically,
and organize thoughts
coherently. However, child has
limited abstract reasoning.

Child begins to understand death
as real and permanent.
Death means that your heart stops,
your blood does not ­circulate,
and you do not breathe.
It may be viewed as a violent event.
Child may not accept death could
happen to himself or herself or
to anyone he or she knows, but
starts to realize that people they
know will die.

“Tell me why you are asking.” Be ­honest
and provide specific details if they
are requested. Help and support the
child’s need for control. Permit and
encourage the child’s participation in
­decision-­making.
“We will work together to help you feel
comfortable. It is very important that you
let us know how you are feeling and what
you need. We will always be with you, so
you do not need to be afraid.”

Abstract thoughts and logic
possible.
Body image is important.
Child needs peer relationships
for support and for validation.
Child expresses altruistic values,
such as staying alive for
family (parents, siblings) and
donating organs/tissue.
Disbelief that they are dying.

Understand death as irreversible,
inevitable, and universal.
Child needs reassurance of
continued care and love.
Search for meaning and purpose
of life.

Reinforce child’s/adolescent’s self-­esteem,
sense of worth, and self-­respect.
Allow need for privacy, independence,
­access to friends and peers.
Tolerate expression of strong emotions and
permit participation in decision-­making.
“I can’t imagine how you must be feeling.
Despite it all, you are doing an incredible
job. I wonder how I can help?”
“What’s most important to you now?”
“What are your hopes … your worries?”
“You have taught me so much; I will always
remember you.”

informal opportunities to express emotions or formal debriefs/check-­
ins for staff at various stages of caring for a child with life-­threatening
illness can be helpful in bettering patient/family care and preventing
staff from experiencing compassion fatigue, burnout, and long-­term
repercussions, including leaving the field.

The Pediatric Clinician

Although optimal palliative care for children entails an interdisciplinary care team approach, pediatric clinicians are well positioned
to support children and their families, particularly when they have
a long-­
standing relationship with multiple family members. A
primary care clinician who has cared for a family over time may
already know and care for other family members, understand preexisting stressors for the family, and be familiar with coping strategies used by family members. For this reason, trusted primary
care clinicians may be best suited to explore goals of care, provide
difficult news in a compassionate manner, and support families
throughout the trajectory of illness. Specialty training is not needed

to provide expert primary palliative care; rather, a motivation to
guide decisions based on family goals and values and understanding of the community supports available are a sufficient starting
point. Pediatric clinicians are familiar with the process of eliciting
concerns and providing anticipatory guidance for parents, as well
as developmentally appropriate explanations for children. Those
interested in developing skillful communication techniques surrounding serious illness have many resources available, including
VitalTalk (vitaltalk.org).

Symptom Management

Intensive symptom management is another cornerstone of pediatric
palliative care. Alleviation of symptoms reduces suffering of the child
and family and allows them to focus on other concerns and participate
in meaningful experiences. Despite increasing attention to symptoms
and pharmacologic and technical advances in medicine, children often
suffer from multiple symptoms. Figure 8.3 provides key elements and
general approaches to managing symptoms.

Fig. 8.3 Key elements of effective symptom management.

Pain is a complex sensation triggered by actual or potential tissue
damage and influenced by cognitive, behavioral, emotional, social,
and cultural factors. Effective pain relief is essential to prevent central sensitization, a central hyperexcitation response that may lead to
hypersensitivity and escalating pain, and to diminish a stress response
that may have a variety of physiologic effects. Assessment tools include
self-­report tools for children who can communicate their pain verbally
and tools based on behavioral cues for children who are unable to do
so because of their age, medical condition, or a neurodevelopmental
disorder. Figure 8.4 and Tables 8.4 and 8.5 address management of pain
(see also Chapter 93).
Many children with life-­threatening illness experience pain that
requires opioids for adequate relief at some point in their illness
trajectory. The WHO pain guidelines recommend the first step for
mild pain and the second step for moderate to severe pain (Fig. 8.4).
Prescribing codeine should be avoided because of its side effect profile and lack of superiority over nonopioid analgesics. Furthermore,
relatively common genetic polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 gene
lead to wide variation in codeine metabolism. Specifically, 10–40%
of individuals carry polymorphisms causing them to be poor metabolizers who cannot convert codeine to its active form, morphine,
and therefore are at risk for inadequate pain control. Others are
ultrametabolizers who may even experience respiratory depression

from rapid generation of morphine from codeine. It is therefore
preferable to use a known amount of the active agent, morphine.
Federal and state health agencies in the United States have put forth
considerable effort in establishing guidelines for opioid prescribing. Before prescribing opioids, create an opioid agreement with
patients and families, check the state’s electronic prescription monitoring program, and limit opioid prescription for minors to 7 days
or less for initial opioid prescription.
It is important to explore with families and members of the care
team misconceptions that they may have regarding opioids, such as
respiratory depression, addiction, dependence, the symbolic meaning
of starting an opioid such as methadone or morphine and/or a morphine drip, and the potential for opioids to hasten death. There is no
association between administration or escalation of opioids and length of
survival. In fact, evidence supports longer survival in individuals with
symptoms that are well controlled. Collaboration with specialty palliative care and/or hospice care teams can help guide complex symptom
management.
Children with serious illness and medical complexity often experience a multitude of nonpain symptoms. A combination of both
pharmacologic (see Table 8.4) and nonpharmacologic (see Table
8.5) interventions is often optimal. Fatigue is one of the most
common symptoms in children with advanced illness. Children

Assess type of pain
Consider nociceptive, neuropathic

Optimize nonopioid analgesics as monotherapy for mild to moderate pain
Consider acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), salicylates, and selective cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibitors

For moderate or severe nociceptive pain, start with a short-acting opioid at regular intervals.
Consider conversion to a long-acting when doses have stabilized
For uncontrolled pain, increase opioid dose by 30–50%; for severe pain,
increase by 50–100%

Administer medications by the simplest, most effective, and least
distressing route

Avoid codeine and opioids with mixed-agonist activity

Communicate with patients and families
Opioids do not have a “ceiling effect”
Escalating symptoms can usually be treated with
an increase in dose; if further titration does not provide adequate analgesia,
the opioid may be rotated to another

Dispel the myth that strong medications

up by 5 mg/kg/day q3-­4 days as needed, but
not to exceed 50-­75 mg/kg/day (3,600 mg/day)

May cause neuropsychiatric events in children
(aggression, emotional lability, hyperkinesia), usually
mild but may require discontinuation of gabapentin.
May cause dizziness, drowsiness, tremor, nystagmus,
ataxia, and swelling.

Nortriptyline

Begin at lower dose and titrate every 3-­4 days
until therapeutic effect or max dose.

Fewer anticholinergic side effects than amitriptyline.
May cause constipation, sedation, postural
hypotension, and dry mouth. May cause QT interval
prolongation (consider ECG). At higher doses,
monitor ECG and plasma levels.

Pregabalin

Table 8.5  Nonpharmacologic Approach to Symptoms Commonly Experienced by Children with Life-­Threatening Illness
SYMPTOM

APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT

Pain

Prevent pain when possible by limiting unnecessary painful procedures, providing sedation, and giving preemptive
analgesia before a procedure (e.g., including sucrose for procedures in neonates).
Address coincident depression, anxiety, sense of fear, or lack of control.
Consider guided imagery, relaxation, hypnosis, art/pet/play therapy, acupuncture/acupressure, cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT), physical therapy, biofeedback, massage, heat/cold, yoga, transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation, and
distraction.

Dyspnea or air hunger

Wipe and/or suction oral secretions if present; positioning; comfortable loose clothing; fan to provide cool, blowing air.
Limit volume of intravenous fluids; consider diuretics if fluid overload/pulmonary edema present.
Behavioral strategies, including breathing exercises, guided imagery, relaxation, music, and distraction.

Fatigue

Sleep hygiene (establish a routine, promote habits for restorative sleep).
Regular, gentle exercise; prioritize or modify activities.
Address potentially contributing factors (e.g., anemia, depression, side effects of medications).
Aromatherapy*: peppermint, rosemary, basil.

Nausea/vomiting

Consider dietary modifications (bland, soft, adjust timing/volume of foods or feeds).
Aromatherapy*: ginger, peppermint, lavender, acupuncture/acupressure.

Constipation

Increase fiber in diet, encourage fluids, ambulation (if possible).

Oral lesions/
dysphagia

Oral hygiene and appropriate liquid, solid, and oral medication formulation (texture, taste, fluidity). Treat infections,
complications (mucositis, pharyngitis, dental abscess, esophagitis).
Oropharyngeal motility study and speech (feeding team) consultation.

Anorexia/cachexia

Manage treatable lesions causing oral pain, dysphagia, or anorexia. Support caloric intake during phase of illness when
anorexia is reversible. Acknowledge that anorexia/cachexia is intrinsic to the dying process and may not be reversible.
Prevent/treat coexisting constipation.

Pruritus

Moisturize skin.
Trim child’s nails to prevent excoriation.
Try specialized anti-­itch lotions.
Apply cold packs.
Counterstimulation, distraction, relaxation.

Diarrhea

Evaluate/treat if obstipation.
Assess and treat infection.
Dietary modification.

Depression

Psychotherapy, behavioral techniques, setting attainable daily goals.
Aromatherapy*: bergamot, lavender.

Anxiety

Psychotherapy (individual and family), behavioral techniques.
Aromatherapy*: clary sage, angelica, mandarin, lavender.

Agitation/terminal
restlessness

Evaluate for organic or drug causes.
Educate family.
Orient and reassure child; provide calm, nonstimulating environment; use familiar music, verse, voice, touch.
Aromatherapy*: frankincense, ylang.

*Best if aromatherapy is administered by a practitioner trained in aromatherapy use and safety and if child has choice of essential oil aroma that stimulates positive response.

may experience fatigue as a physical symptom (e.g., weakness or
somnolence), a decline in cognition (e.g., diminished attention or
concentration), and impaired emotional function (e.g., depressed
mood or decreased motivation). Because of its multidimensional
and incapacitating nature, fatigue can prevent children from participating in meaningful or pleasurable activities, thereby impairing
quality of life. Fatigue is usually multifactorial in etiology. A careful history may reveal contributing physical factors (uncontrolled
symptoms, medication side effects), psychologic factors (anxiety,
depression), spiritual distress, or sleep disturbance. It is important
to explore a patient’s sleep history and encourage behavioral interventions such as optimizing sleep hygiene (e.g., instituting a regular
bedtime routine, limiting screens and physical activity before bed),
and sticking to regular sleep and wake times as much as feasible.
If biobehavioral approaches remain ineffective, pharmacologic
approaches such as trazodone may be considered. Interventions to
reduce fatigue include treatment of contributing factors, exercise,

behavior modification strategies, and pharmacologic agents. Challenges to effectively addressing fatigue include the common belief
that fatigue is inevitable, lack of communication between families
and care teams about it, and limited awareness of potential interventions for fatigue.
Dyspnea (the subjective sensation of shortness of breath) results
from a mismatch between afferent sensory input to the brain and
the outgoing motor signal from the brain. It may stem from respiratory causes (e.g., airway secretions, obstruction, infection) or other
factors (e.g., cardiac) and may also be influenced by psychologic
factors (e.g., anxiety). Respiratory parameters such as respiratory
rate and oxygen saturation correlate unreliably with the degree of
dyspnea. Therefore giving oxygen to a cyanotic or hypoxic child
who is otherwise quiet and relaxed may relieve staff discomfort
while having no impact on patient distress and may also add burden if the child cannot tolerate the mask or cannula. Dyspnea can
be relieved with the use of regularly scheduled plus as-­needed doses of

70 Part I u The Field of Pediatrics
opioids. Opioids work directly on the brainstem to reduce the sensation of respiratory distress, as opposed to relieving dyspnea by
sedation. The dose of opioid needed to reduce dyspnea is as little
as 25% of the amount that would be given for analgesia. Nonpharmacologic interventions, including guided imagery or hypnosis to
reduce anxiety, or cool, flowing air, aimed toward the face, are also
frequently helpful in alleviating dyspnea. Although oxygen may
relieve hypoxemia-­related headaches, it is no more effective than
blowing room air in reducing the distressing sensation of shortness
of breath.
As death approaches, a buildup of secretions may result in noisy respiration sometimes referred to with the outdated term “death rattle.”
Patients at this stage are usually unconscious, and noisy respirations are
often more distressing for others than for the child. It is often helpful
to discuss this anticipated phenomenon with families in advance, and
if it occurs, to point out the child’s lack of distress from it. Nonpharmacologic interventions include positional changes, and if treatment
is needed, an anticholinergic medication, such as glycopyrrolate, may
reduce secretions.
Neurologic symptoms include seizures that are often part of
the antecedent illness but may increase in frequency and severity toward the end of life. A plan for managing seizures should be
made in advance, and anticonvulsants should be readily available in
the event of seizure. Parents can be taught to use rectal diazepam
at home. Increased neuroirritability accompanies some neurodegenerative disorders; it may be particularly disruptive because of
the resultant break in normal sleep–wake patterns and the difficulty in finding respite facilities for children who have prolonged
crying or difficulty consoling. Such neuroirritability may respond
to gabapentin. Judicious use of sedatives, benzodiazepines, clonidine, nortriptyline, or methadone may also reduce irritability without inducing excessive sedation; such treatment can dramatically
improve the quality of life for both child and caregivers. Increased
intracranial pressure and spinal cord compression are most often
encountered in children with brain tumors or metastatic and solid
tumors. Depending on the clinical situation and the goals of care,
radiation therapy, surgical interventions, and steroids are potential
therapeutic options.
Delirium is an underrecognized brain disorder characterized
by waxing and waning attention, confusion, and disorientation.
Agitation may occur along with features of hypomania. Although
delirium as a whole is often not diagnosed, the hypomanic form
is particularly underrecognized. Delirium has a range of causes,
including electrolyte imbalances, organ dysfunction, sleep–wake
cycle disturbances, and results of medications such as anticholinergics and benzodiazepines. Environmental strategies to calm and
orient the child while addressing potentially contributing factors
are helpful. In some patients, antipsychotic/neuroleptic medications are indicated (see Chapters 33 and 47).
Feeding and hydration issues can raise ethical questions that
evoke intense emotions in families and medical caregivers alike.
Options that may be considered to artificially support nutrition
and hydration in a child who can no longer feed by mouth include
nasogastric and gastrostomy feedings or intravenous nutrition or
hydration (see Chapter 60). These complex decisions require evaluating the risks and benefits of artificial feedings and taking into
consideration the child’s functional level and prognosis. At times,
it may be appropriate to initiate a trial of tube feedings, with the
understanding that they may be discontinued at a later stage of the
illness. A commonly held but unsubstantiated belief is that artificial nutrition and hydration are comfort measures, without which
a child may suffer from starvation or thirst. The sensation of thirst
may be alleviated by careful efforts to keep the mouth moist and
clean. There are also deleterious side effects to artificial hydration
in the form of increased secretions, need for frequent urination,
edema, and exacerbation of dyspnea. For these reasons, it is important to educate families about anticipated decreases in appetite/

thirst and therefore little need for nutrition and hydration as the
child approaches death. In addition, exploring the meaning that
provision of nutrition and hydration may hold for families, as well
as helping families anticipate the changes in their child’s appearance
and exploring alternative ways that they may love and nurture their
child, may ease distress around this issue.
Nausea and vomiting may be caused by medications or toxins,
irritation to or obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, motion, and
emotions. Drugs such as metoclopramide, 5-­hydroxytryptamine
antagonists, corticosteroids, olanzapine, and aprepitant may be
used and should be chosen depending on the underlying pathophysiology and neurotransmitters involved. Vomiting may accompany nausea but may also occur without nausea, as with increased
intracranial pressure. Constipation is commonly encountered in
children with neurologic impairment or children receiving medications that impair gastrointestinal motility (most notably opioids).
Stool frequency and quantity should be evaluated in the context of
the child’s diet and usual bowel pattern. Children using scheduled
opioids should routinely be placed on an osmotic laxative (polyethylene glycol) in addition to a stimulant laxative agent (e.g., senna).
For some patients, parenteral methylnaltrexone is also helpful in
relieving opioid-­induced constipation. Diarrhea may be particularly difficult for the child and family and may be treated with loperamide (an opioid that does not cross the blood-­brain barrier), and
in some cases, cholestyramine or octreotide may be indicated. Paradoxical diarrhea, a result of overflow resulting from constipation,
should also be included in the differential diagnosis.
Hematologic issues include consideration of anemia and thrombocytopenia or bleeding. If the child has symptomatic anemia (weakness,
dizziness, shortness of breath, tachycardia), red blood cell transfusions
may be considered. Platelet transfusions may be an option if the child
has symptoms of bleeding. Teabags on the gums and topical agents such
as Amicar may be used for mucosal bleeding. It is important to provide
anticipatory education that although distressing to see, bleeding is not
painful. Life-­ending hemorrhage is disturbing for all concerned, and a
plan involving environment intervention such as dark sheets and the
use of fast-­acting sedatives should be prepared in advance if such an
event is a possibility.
Skin care issues include primary prevention of problems by
ongoing and timely assessment (including observation of indwelling lines and tubes) and frequent turning and repositioning and
alleviating pressure wherever possible (e.g., elevating heels off the
bed with pillows). Pruritus may be secondary to systemic disorders
or drug therapy. Treatment includes avoiding excessive use of drying soaps, using moisturizers, trimming fingernails, and wearing
loose-­fitting clothing, in addition to administering topical or systemic corticosteroids. Oral antihistamines and other specific therapies may also be indicated (e.g., cholestyramine in biliary disease).
Opioids can cause histamine release from mast cells, but this does
not account for most of the pruritus caused by opioids. Given that
opioid-­induced pruritus is generally not histamine-­mediated, the
mainstay of treatment includes rotating opioids or instituting a low
dose of opioid antagonist (nalbuphine or naloxone) rather than an
antihistamine.
Children with life-­threatening illness may experience psychologic
symptoms such as anxiety and depression. Such symptoms are frequently multifactorial and sometimes interrelated with uncontrolled
symptoms such as pain and fatigue. Diagnosing depression in the context of serious illness may pose challenges because neurovegetative
symptoms may not be reliable indicators. Instead, expressions of hopelessness, helplessness, worthlessness, and guilt may be more useful.
Interventions and opportunities for children to explore worries, hopes,
and concerns in an open, supportive, and nonjudgmental setting are
equally, if not more, important approaches to psychologic distress.
Skilled members from a variety of disciplines, including psychology,
social work, chaplaincy, child life, and expressive therapy, may help
children and their families in this regard. Such opportunities may

Chapter 8 u Pediatric Palliative Care
create positive moments in which meaning, connection, and new
definitions of hope are found. Pharmacologic agents such as antidepressants may be helpful, although their effect is often preceded by a
significant lag phase. Because of its immediate and positive effect on
mood, methylphenidate may be an effective antidepressant for children at the end of life, when there may not be time for a traditional
antidepressant to take effect.
Discussions with adolescent patients, or with the parents of any
ill child, about possible therapies or interventions should include
integrative therapies such as massage therapy, Reiki, acupuncture, clinical aromatherapy, prayer, and nutritional supplements.
Many families use integrative therapy but do not bring it up with
their physician unless explicitly asked (see Chapter 7). Although
largely unproven, some of these therapies are inexpensive and provide relief to individual patients. Other therapies may be expensive, painful, intrusive, and even toxic. By initiating a conversation
and inviting discussion in a nonjudgmental way, the clinician can
offer advice on the safety of different therapies and may help avoid
expensive, dangerous, or burdensome interventions. Medical marijuana (cannabis) for pediatric use has been legalized by some states,
and pediatricians are increasingly asked about it. In such cases, it is
most helpful to use this opportunity to engage in a broader conversation about symptoms and symptom management, even in states
where use of cannabis for pediatric medicinal purposes is legal.

Intensive Symptom Management

At the end of life, when intensive efforts to relieve the symptom
have been exhausted, or when efforts to address suffering are incapable of providing relief with acceptable toxicity/morbidity or in
an acceptable time frame, palliative sedation may be considered.
Palliative sedation may relieve suffering from refractory symptoms
by reducing a child’s level of consciousness. It is most often used for
intractable pain, dyspnea, or agitation, but is not limited to these
distressing indications. It is imperative that parents, staff, and primary clinicians discuss the indications and goals for sedation before
initiation of this therapy, as well as questions or concerns about this
therapy, and to engage in ongoing discussions after initiation of
sedation.
The doctrine of double effect (DDE) is often invoked to justify escalation of symptom-­relieving medications or palliative sedation for
uncontrolled symptoms at the end of life. Use of DDE emphasizes the
risk of hastening death posed by escalating opioids or sedation, which
is theoretical and unproven (see Chapter 6). There is mounting evidence that patients with well-­controlled symptoms live longer.

Approaching End of Life and Bereavement

As death seems imminent, the major task of the physician and team is
to help the child have as many good days as possible and not suffer. If
patient and family preference is to remain at home and clinical status
and community supports allow this, if not already in place, a referral
for hospice care (usually provided in the home, rather than a hospice
facility) may provide the most comprehensive care for the child and
family. Gently preparing the family for what to expect and offering
choices, when possible, will allow them a sense of control in the midst
of tragic circumstances. Before death, it can be very helpful to discuss
the following:
u Support of siblings or other family members
u Resuscitation status
u Limiting technology when no longer beneficial to the child
u Cultural, spiritual, or religious needs
u Location of death
•	Who will pronounce if death occurs at home
u Funeral arrangements

71

•	Offering siblings choice and appropriate support to attend
u Autopsy and/or tissue/organ donation
•	Builds a legacy, benefits others, and informs science and family

Offered the opportunity, families will often tolerate thinking and
speaking about their hopes and fears regarding their child’s end of life,
and some even express relief when the door to such a conversation is
opened by the care team. It may help to let the family know these conversations are not about whether the child will die, but how the child
may die.
Families gain tremendous support from having a physician and team
who will continue to stay involved in the child’s care. If the child is
at home or hospitalized, regular phone calls or visits, assisting with
symptom management, and offering emotional support is invaluable
for families.
In an intensive care setting, where technology can be overwhelming
and put distance between the child and parent, the physician can offer
discontinuation of that which is no longer benefiting the child or adding to quality of life. Less invasive ways to control symptoms, such as
subcutaneous infusions or topical applications, may be helpful. Parents
may be afraid to ask about holding their child or sleeping next to their
child. They may need reassurance and assistance in holding, touching,
and speaking with their child, despite tubes and technology, even if the
child appears unresponsive.
It is believed that hearing and the ability to sense touch are often
present until death; all family members should be encouraged to
continue interacting with their loved one through the dying process
as they feel comfortable. Parents may be afraid to leave the bedside
so that their child will not die alone. Offering parents other supports such as chaplaincy/clergy, social work, and extended family
members may be helpful. In most instances the moment of death
cannot be predicted. Some propose that children wait to die until
their parents are ready, an important event has passed, or they are
given permission. The care team need not dispute this, nor the hope
for a miracle often held by families until the child takes the last
breath.
For the family, the moment of death is an event that is recalled in
detail for years to come, and thus enhancing opportunity for dignity
and limited suffering is essential. Research suggests that improved
symptom control and easing of difficult moments at the time of death
may lessen the long-­term distress of bereaved parents. Clinical experience has shown that families often find solace in clinician presence,
whether at home or in the hospital. After death, families should be
given the option of remaining with their child for as long as they would
like and should be prepared for changes in the child’s body. During
this time, physicians and other professionals may ask permission to say
goodbye. The family may be invited to bathe and dress the body as a
final act of caring for the child.
The clinician’s decision to attend the funeral is a personal one. Participation may serve the dual purpose of showing respect and helping the provider cope with a personal sense of loss. If unable to attend
services, families report highly valuing the importance of receiving a
call, card, or note from the physician. To know that their child made a
difference and will not be forgotten is often very important to families
in their bereavement. Furthermore, bereaved parents cite ongoing support from their child’s healthcare teams and medical institutions after
the death of their child as essential sources of support during their grief
journeys. Many families benefit from community-­based bereavement
support groups, which are often offered through hospice organizations,
or individual grief counseling.

Chapter 9

Domestic and International
Adoption
Elaine E. Schulte
Adoption is a social, emotional, and legal process that provides
a new family for a child when the family of origin is unable or
unwilling to parent. In the United States, about 1.5 million children <18 years of age are adopted; 2–4% of American families have
adopted. In the United States, approximately 135,000 children are
adopted every year. Of these, 59% are from the child welfare (foster) system, 25% are from other countries, and 15% are voluntarily
relinquished American babies. The remaining numbers are from
private agencies, American Indigenous Nations, stepparent, or
other forms of kinship care. Because of changing policies toward
adoption and social change in several of the sending countries, the
number of international adoptions has decreased dramatically over
the last 15 years. Public agencies support approximately 50% of
total annual adoptions in the United States, private agencies facilitate 25% of adoptions, and independent practitioners (e.g., lawyers) handle 15% of adoptions. Compared to 19% of the general
population, approximately 39% of adopted children have special
healthcare needs.

DOMESTIC ADOPTION

The Adoption and Safe Families Act (P.L. 105-­89) requires children
in foster care to be placed with adoptive families if they cannot be
safely returned to their families within a reasonable time. In fiscal year
(FY) 2020 there were an estimated 407,000 children in foster care and
117,000 waiting for adoption. Of the 224,000 who exited foster care,
48% were reunited with parent(s) or primary caretaker(s) and 25%
were adopted. Of the 53,500 children who were adopted in 2021, 55%
were adopted by their foster parent(s) and 34% were adopted by relatives (see Chapter 10).
Many children awaiting adoption are less likely to be adopted
because they are of school age, are part of a sibling group, are members of historically oppressed racial/ethnic groups, or have considerable physical, emotional, or developmental needs. A number of policy
efforts are aimed at increasing adoption opportunities for these children, including federal adoption subsidies, tax credits, recruitment
efforts to identify ethnically diverse adults willing to adopt, increased
preplacement services, and expanding adoption opportunities to single
adults, older couples, and gay/lesbian partners.
Same-­sex couple adoption is legal in more than a dozen countries
worldwide. Although legislation regarding same-­sex couple adoption
varies by state, increasing numbers of gay and lesbian partners have
been able to adopt. Current estimates suggest that over 2 million children, including 5% of all adopted children, are raised by gay or lesbian
parents. Adopted children include those adopted domestically, those
from foster care, and internationally adopted children. There is good
evidence that children raised by same-­sex couples are as physically
or psychologically healthy, capable, and successful as those raised by
opposite-­sex couples. Pediatricians can advocate for adopted children
by supporting gay and lesbian parents.
Open adoption, usually through an agency or privately, occurs
when the birth mother arranges to continue to be involved, although
in a limited manner, with the legally adopted family. This may occur
through surrogacy or, more often, in an unplanned pregnancy.

INTERCOUNTRY ADOPTION

Along with foster care adoptions, international adoptions are
a way of providing stable, long-­term care to vulnerable children

throughout the world. There is concern that in some countries of
origin, the rapid growth of international adoption has outpaced
regulation and oversight to protect vulnerable children and families.
Opportunities for financial gain have led to abuses, including the
sale and abduction of children, bribery, and financial coercion of
families, but the extent and scope of the potential concern are difficult to ascertain. Increasing global efforts, such as the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-­operation in Respect
of Intercountry Adoption, have promoted political cooperation
between nations and established international law to reduce the
potential for child abduction and child trafficking and to ensure that
the best interests of the child are paramount in decision-­making.
Participating nations, including the United States, are working to
address the myriad of sociopolitical conditions that create the need
for out-­of-­family care and are working to support children within
their nation’s borders. International adoption is increasingly considered a measure of last resort if the child cannot be cared for within
his or her family of origin (including extended relatives), the immediate community, or the larger national culture. As a result, children
adopted internationally into the United States are more likely to
enter their families at older ages or with complex medical, developmental, or social-­emotional needs.
In 2021, US families adopted 1,785 children from other countries
(compared to a peak of 22,884 in 2004). Children from Bulgaria,
Columbia, India, Nigeria, South Korea, and Ukraine represented
65% of children adopted internationally into the United States; 2021
marked the first year since 1984 where no children where adopted
from China. Although individual experiences vary, most children placed
for international adoption have some history of poverty and social hardship in their home countries, and most are adopted from orphanages or
institutional settings. Many young infants are placed into orphanage care
shortly after birth. Some older children have experienced family disruption
resulting from parental illness, war, or natural disasters. Still others enter
orphanage care after determination of significant abuse or neglect within
their biologic families. The effects of institutionalization and other life
stresses may affect all areas of growth and development. As a result, many
children require specialized support and understanding to overcome the
impact of stress and early adversity and to reach their full potential.

ROLE OF PEDIATRICIANS
Preadoption Medical Record Reviews

Preadoption medical record reviews are important for both domestic
and international adoptions. Adoption agencies are making increased
efforts to obtain biologic family health information and genetic histories to share with adoptive families before adoption. Such information often becomes increasingly relevant as the child ages. The unique
medical and developmental needs of adopted children have led to the
creation of specialty clinics throughout the United States, which may
be a valuable resource for adoptive families at all stages in the adoption process and throughout the adopted child’s life. When available,
adoption medicine pediatricians can help prospective adoptive parents
understand the health and developmental history of a child and available background information from birth families in order to assess
actual and potential medical and psychosocial risk factors to support
adult decision-­making about the family’s ability to parent the waiting
child.
Under the Hague Convention, U.S. agencies that arrange international adoptions must make efforts to obtain accurate and complete
health histories on children awaiting adoption. The nature and quality of medical and genetic information, when available, vary greatly.
Incongruous translation and use of medical terminology and medications that are unfamiliar to U.S.-­trained physicians are common.
Results of specific diagnostic studies and laboratory tests performed
outside the United States should not be relied on and should be repeated
once the child arrives in the United States. Paradoxically, review of the
child’s medical records may raise more questions than provide answers.
Each medical diagnosis should be considered carefully before being
rejected or accepted. Country-­specific growth curves should be avoided
because they do not reflect the demographic of institutionalized

children. Instead, serial growth data should be plotted on U.S. standard
growth curves; this may reveal a pattern of poor growth because of
malnutrition or other chronic illness. Photographs or video files may
provide the only objective information from which medical status can
be determined. Full-­face photographs may reveal dysmorphic features
consistent with fetal alcohol syndrome (see Chapter 146) or findings
suggestive of other congenital disorders.
Frank interpretations of available information should be shared with
the prospective adoptive parents. The role of the healthcare provider
is not to comment on the advisability of an adoption, but to inform
the prospective parents of any significant medical, developmental, and
behavioral health needs identified now or anticipated in the future.

Postadoption Medical Care
Arrival Visit: International Adoption

All internationally adopted children should have a thorough medical evaluation shortly after arriving in the United States. Many children may have acute or chronic medical problems that are not always
immediately evident, including malnutrition, growth deficiencies, stool
pathogens, anemia, elevated blood lead, dental decay, strabismus, birth
defects, developmental delay, feeding and sensory difficulty, and social-­
emotional concerns. All children who are adopted from other countries
should undergo comprehensive screening for infectious diseases and disorders of growth, development, vision, and hearing (Tables 9.1 and 9.2).
Regardless of test results before arrival, all children should be screened
for tuberculosis with either a tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-­γ
release assay (IGRA). If the child’s purified protein derivative (PPD)
skin test is negative, it should be repeated in 4-­6 months; children may
have false-­negative tests because of poor nutrition. Additional tests (e.g.,
malaria) should be ordered depending on the prevalence of disease in the
child’s country of origin (see Chapter 11). Immunization records should
be carefully reviewed. Internationally adopted children frequently have
incomplete records or have been vaccinated using alternative schedules.
Pediatricians may choose to check titers to determine which vaccines
need to be given, or they can choose to reimmunize the child.

Growth Delays

Physical growth delays are common in internationally adopted children and may represent the combined result of many factors, such as
unknown/untreated medical conditions, malnutrition, and psychologic

74 Part I u The Field of Pediatrics
Developmental Delays

Many children adopted internationally exhibit delays in at least one
area of development, but most exhibit significant gains within the first
12 months after adoption. Children adopted at older ages are likely to
have more variable outcomes. In the immediate postadoption period,
it may be impossible to determine with any certainty whether developmental delays will be transient or long-­lasting. Careful monitoring
of development within the first years of adoption can identify a developmental trend over time that may be more predictive of long-­term
functioning than assessment at any specific point in time. When in
doubt, it is better to refer early for developmental intervention, rather
than wait to see if the children will catch up (see Chapter 28).

Language Development

For both domestic and international adoptees, genetic or biologic
risk factors for poor language development may be identified preadoptively, but it is unlikely that international adoptees will have
had these delays identified before adoption. These children typically have not had an assessment in their native language and have
had little exposure to English. If assessment in their native language
is not available, it may not be possible to fully assess their language
abilities until they have had a chance to learn English. Regardless
of the age at adoption, most internationally adopted children will
reach age-­expected language skills over time.
If a child has language delays, referral to early intervention or
the school district should be made. Clinicians may need to work
with these groups to help them understand the unique circumstances surrounding an adopted child’s language development. For
example, English language acquisition in internationally adopted
children depends on the age of adoption and native language skills.
Placing the recently adopted, school-­age child in an English as a
second language class may not be sufficient if the child’s language
development in the primary language has been atypical.

Eating Concerns

Initial concerns about eating, sleep regulation, and repetitive (e.g.,
self-­stimulating or self-­soothing) behaviors are common, especially
among children adopted after a high degree of neglect or developmental trauma. Feeding behaviors of international adoptees may be
linked to orphanage feeding practices or limited exposure to textured or solid foods during later infancy/toddlerhood. Children
who have experienced chronic lack of food may not have developed
an awareness of satiation cues, leading to hoarding or frequent vomiting. Feeding concerns often subside gradually with introduction
of age-­appropriate foods and parental support for positive feeding
practices. Many children who were adopted after significant malnutrition may eat an excessive amount of food. Unless the child is
eating to the point of vomiting (which would indicate little awareness of satiation cues), it is generally best to allow them to eat until
satiation. Typically, within several months, the child will regulate
food intake appropriately. Occasionally, additional support from a
speech pathologist or feeding specialist is warranted to address possible sensory, physical, or psychologic issues around proper feeding.

Sleep Concerns

Sleep is often disrupted as the child reacts to changes in routines and
environments. Efforts to create continuity between the preadoption
and postadoption environment can be helpful. Within the first 3-­6
months, as the child’s emotional self-­regulation improves, many sleep
concerns subside. Similarly, stereotypical behaviors, such as rocking
or head banging, often diminish within the first few months after
adoption.

Social and Emotional Development

Dyadic interactions between child and caretaker are a critical component to later regulatory functioning and social-­emotional development.
The amount and quality of individualized caretaking that children
have received before their adoption, whether international, domestic,
or through the foster care system, is usually unknown. In many cases,

entry into a secure, stable home setting with consistent childcare routines
is sufficient to support the child’s emerging social-­emotional development.
Pediatricians can help parents remember that adoption is part of the child’s
identity. Throughout one’s childhood, prior experiences or biologic disposition may result in behavior that is confusing to the adoptive parents. The
child’s reactions may be subtle or difficult to interpret, interfering with the
parents’ ability to respond in a sensitive manner. In these circumstances,
additional behavioral health support may be helpful to foster the emerging
relationships and behavioral regulation in the newly formed family.

Racial Identity Development

Transracial adoption (where the racial background of the child differs
from that of the parent/parents) accounts for a significant percentage
of adoptions each year in the United States. In most of these adoptive placements, children of color have been adopted by White parents. Racial identity development, including ways to understand and
respond to discrimination, is increasingly recognized as important in
the overall development of children. Surveys of adults adopted transracially indicate that racial identity is of central importance at many
ages and tends to increase in significance during young adulthood.
Integrating race/ethnicity into identity can be a complex process for all
children, but it may be especially complicated when they are raised in
a family where racial differences are noted. Adults raised within interracial families have noted the value of attending racially diverse schools
and of having adult role models (e.g., teachers, doctors, coaches) who
share their racial background. Parents who adopt transracially are
often encouraged to support interactions within diverse communities
and to discuss race (and associated discrimination) often within the
family. Black children raised by White families in White communities
may have been sheltered from overt racism but need to be taught that
many others (including law enforcement officers) will regard them as
Black with all the intense biases associated with race (see Chapter 2.1).
Adoption culture camps are another option for transracial Black
children to experience their racial heritage and meet children with
similar experiences. In addition, there are Asian (Chinese, Korean)
heritage camps that provide a similar cultural experience for internationally adopted children.

Toxic Stress

The cumulative amount of unsupported early adversity (e.g., numerous years within international orphanage care, extensive abuse/neglect
before removal from the biologic family, or multiple foster care placements) experienced by a child before adoption, referred to as toxic
stress, can affect both immediate placement stability and long-­term
physical health and emotional well-­being (see Chapter 2). The degree
of presumed toxic stress may be helpful in interpreting a child’s behavior and supporting family functioning.*

Family Support

The unique aspects to adoptive family formation can create familial
stress and affect child and family functioning. Some adoptive families
may have to address infertility, creation of a multiracial family, disclosure of adoptive status, concerns and questions the child may have
about their preadoptive experiences and biologic origins, and ongoing scrutiny by adoption agencies. With gay/lesbian parents, there are
often additional psychosocial stressors, including continued barriers to
legal recognition of both parents in a gay/lesbian partnership that can
negatively affect family functioning. Although most families acclimate
well to adoption-­related stressors, some parents experience postadoption depression and may benefit from additional mental health support
to ease the family’s transition.

Adoption Narrative

Families are encouraged to speak openly and repeatedly about adoption with their child, beginning in the toddler years and continuing through adolescence. Creating a lifebook for the adopted child
provides a way to support family communication about the child’s

history and significant relationships (including members of the family of origin) and to document the child’s important life transitions
(e.g., through foster care or immigration to the United States). It is
common, and normal, for children to have questions about adoption
and their preadoptive experiences and biologic family throughout
their development. An increase in cognitive understanding between
ages 7 and 10 years can sometimes increase adoption-­related questions and distress. Youth who have questions about biologic family
members are increasingly able to access information via social media
and web-­based searching, raising the importance of ongoing open
communication about adoption. Pediatricians may need to respond
to increased concerns and questions when the adoptee’s health and
genetic history is incomplete or unknown. It is important to remember that, at any time, concerns about development, behavior, and
social-­emotional functioning may or may not be related to the child’s
adoption history.
The vast majority of adopted children and families adjust well and
lead healthy, productive lives. Adoptions infrequently disrupt; disruption rates are higher among children adopted from foster care, which
research associates with their age at adoption and a history of multiple placements before adoption. With increased understanding of
the needs of families who adopt children from foster care, agencies
are placing greater emphasis on the preparation of adoptive parents
and ensuring the availability of a full range of postadoption services,
including physical health, mental health, and developmental services
for their adopted children.

Approximately 37% of children in foster care in the United States are
younger than 5 years, and 28% are older than 12 years. Most children
are White (44%), 22% are Black, 22% are Hispanic of any race, and
8% are identified as 2 or more races. Child welfare agencies have been
attending to the drivers of disparities rooted in implicit bias and structural racism for nearly 2 decades. Despite efforts to address disparities,
Black, Latinx, and Indigenous children are overrepresented in foster
care compared with their representation in the population at large. The
average length of stay in foster care continues to decline (median in
2021, 14.9 months), though 33% of children spend >2 years in care as
of 2021. Approximately half of children achieve reunification, and 25%
are adopted and 9% reside with relatives. Among the remaining children, 8% emancipate between ages 18 and 21. There were 368 deaths
reported in foster care in FY 2021.
Placement instability (multiple placements) is associated with
poor outcomes for children in foster care, including poor educational
outcomes and increased behavioral and mental health issues as well
as delayed permanency (i.e., reunification, adoption). The majority of
children in foster care for longer than 2 years have three or more placements. Important predictors of multiple placements include older age,
longer time in custody, history of sexual or physical abuse, and behavioral and physical health challenges.
Youth who emancipate (e.g., age out) from foster care face additional challenges. Approximately 75% have graduated from high school
or obtained a GED. By age 24, only 5% have graduated from any 2-­
or 4-­year college and only half are employed. 39% have experienced
homelessness or “couch surfing.” 81% of males and 57% of females
have been arrested. Two thirds of females and one half of males report
they have had at least one child. Extended foster care to age 21 benefits
youth in foster care, although it does not eliminate all risks.

LEGISLATION IN THE UNITED STATES

Chapter 10

Foster and Kinship Care
Mary V. Greiner, Heather C. Forkey, and
Moira Szilagyi

The placement of children in out-­of-­home care has served the needs of
children in many societies worldwide throughout history. The institution of foster care was developed in the United States as a temporary
resource for children during times of family crisis and is rooted in the
principle that children fare best when raised in family settings. The
mission of foster care is to provide for the safety, permanency, and well-­
being of children while assisting their families with services to promote
reunification.

EPIDEMIOLOGY

The number of children in foster care worldwide is unknown, although
it has been estimated that 8 million may be in foster and congregate
care. On September 30, 2021, approximately 391,098 children in the
United States resided in foster care, down from a high of 511,318 in care
in 2005. Early in the millennium, foster care numbers decreased despite
an increase in maltreatment reports, as child welfare offered families
more preventive services and placement with relatives (kinship care)
or nonrelative caregivers as an alternative to court-­ordered removal.
Higher rates of children in care, reaching 437,337 in 2018, appear to be
related to the opioid epidemic. Over the last 10 years, reunification rates
and adoption of children from foster care have increased. Nationally,
approximately 44% of children live with a nonrelative foster caregiver,
35% of children are in placement with a relative, 9% are in congregate
(group) care, and 2% are in supervised independent living.

In the United States, the Adoption and Safe Families Act (P.L. 105-­89)
requires that a permanency plan be made for each child no later than
12 months after entry into foster care and that a petition to terminate
parental rights typically be filed when a child has been in foster care for
at least 15 of the previous 22 months. The Fostering Connections and
Promoting Adoptions Act of 2009 (P.L. 110-­351) focused on incentives for guardianship and adoption, supports for young adults at the
age of emancipation, and rights of U.S. Indigenous Nation children to
caregiving within their tribe. This act also contained a clause requiring states to develop and coordinate healthcare systems for children in
foster care in collaboration with Medicaid and pediatricians. In 2018
the Family First Prevention Services Act was signed into law. This
legislation emphasizes providing evidence-­based mental health and
substance abuse services for families whose children are at imminent
risk of entering foster care, addresses the need for children in care to
be provided with appropriate evidence-­based mental health services,
and has incentives to move children in care from congregate to family
settings.

EARLY CHILDHOOD TRAUMA LEADS TO POOR
HEALTH OUTCOMES

Children in foster care have high rates of early childhood trauma and
adversity. More than 60% are placed in foster care for neglect, 12% for
physical abuse, 4% for sexual abuse, and 5% are abandoned. Parental
alcohol and other substance use is a known factor in 42% of removals
and are likely underestimated. Parental alcohol and substance use also
contributes to prenatal substance exposures for their children. Violence in the home is common, with many children having experienced
intimate partner and/or community violence.
Removal from the family of origin may compound prior trauma
experiences, although some children experience relief at removal from
a chaotic, abusive, or dangerous home. No matter the circumstances of
removal, most children miss their family, worry about their family, and
long for reunification. Separation, loss and grief, unpredictable contact
with family of origin, placement changes, the process of terminating
parental rights, and the sheer uncertainty of foster care may further
erode a child’s well-­being.

76 Part I u The Field of Pediatrics
Childhood trauma is correlated with poor developmental, behavioral, and health outcomes. Early trauma and chronic stress adversely
affect the neurobiology of the developing brain, especially those
areas involved in attention, emotional regulation, memory, executive function, and cognition. As a result, shortened attention span,
hyperactivity or dissociation, poorer cognitive function, aggression,
and memory issues are problems encountered frequently among
children in foster care. Evidence-­based mental health trauma treatment is recommended for children who are symptomatic. Additionally, evidence shows that foster care–specific interventions, such as
specially trained foster caregivers and mentoring for adolescents in
foster care, can improve outcomes, although replication and dissemination of these evidence-­based interventions is limited.

HEALTH ISSUES

Experiencing multiple childhood adversities and receiving fragmented and inadequate health services before placement into foster
care mean that children enter foster care with a high prevalence
of chronic medical, mental health, developmental, dental, and educational problems. Thus they are defined as children with special
healthcare needs (CSHCN). The greatest single healthcare need
of this population is for high-­quality, evidence-­based, trauma-­
informed mental health services to address the impacts of prior and
ongoing trauma, loss, and unpredictability. In addition, children in
foster care have higher rates of asthma, growth failure, obesity, vertically transmitted infections, hearing and vision loss, dental decay,
and neurologic conditions than the general pediatric population.
Adolescents need access to reproductive health and substance use
services. Up to 60% of children <5 years old have a developmental delay in at least one domain, and >40% of school-­age children
qualify for special education services. Unfortunately, educational
difficulties persist despite improvements in school attendance
and performance after placement in foster care. Each placement
change that is accompanied by a change in school sets children
back academically by about 4 months. Federal legislation requires
child welfare to maintain children in their school of origin when
possible, even if child welfare has to provide transportation to
ensure this.
Although children in foster care are CSHCN, they often lack
access to the services they need. Most public and private child welfare agencies do not have formal arrangements for accessing the
needed array of health services and rely on local physicians and
health clinics funded by Medicaid. Health histories are often sparse
at admission because many have lacked regular care, or their family
of origin may not be available, and information sharing between
medical and child welfare settings is often very limited. Once children enter foster care, there is often a diffusion of responsibility for
obtaining healthcare services across caregivers and child welfare.
Foster caregivers usually receive little information about a child’s
healthcare needs, but they are typically expected to decide when
and where children receive medical treatment. Child welfare professionals are responsible for ensuring that a child’s health needs are
addressed, but coordination across multiple healthcare providers
can be daunting. Although child welfare can consent to routine care
and even some procedures, the child’s parents or family of origin
may retain some medical decision-making rights unless parental
rights have been terminated. Complexity in legal responsibility for
making healthcare treatment decisions and access to health information may delay or result in the denial of healthcare services.

HEALTHCARE FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS
IN FOSTER CARE

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has published detailed
healthcare standards for children in foster care, available on the
Healthy Foster Care America website. The AAP recommends that

children receive healthcare services in a medical home setting,
where comprehensive healthcare is continuous over time. Compassionate, culturally competent healthcare that is trauma-­informed
means that health staff should understand, recognize, and respond
to symptoms and risk factors of traumatic stress and provide an
environment that offers physical, emotional, and psychologic safety
for children and caregivers. In foster care, attention must be paid
to the effects of past trauma and the impact of ongoing uncertainty
and loss on a child’s health and well-­being, as well as that of their
birth and foster/kinship caregivers.
The trauma-­informed office is one in which symptoms such as
dysregulation of sleep, behavioral problems, developmental delays,
poor school function, and somatic complaints are recognized as
potential effects of childhood trauma. Understanding the child’s
psychosocial context and history, as well as that of the caregiver, and
exploring their strengths, assets, and challenges are the foundation
of a trauma-­informed approach. The office should have resources
for education of families and child welfare professionals and ideally
the ability to make warm hand-offs to community resources. Integrated trauma-­informed pediatric mental health services are ideal,
with referrals to community mental health services when needed,
in collaboration with caregivers, child welfare, and educators.
Continuity of care is very important for the child in foster care
and includes ongoing monitoring and management of progress and
care.
Several recommendations are specific to the care of children and
youth in foster care (Table 10.1). Children should be seen early and
often when they first enter a new placement to identify all their
health issues and to support the child and caregivers through a
major transition that involves considerable loss and adjustment,
including the development of an attachment relationship with a
new caregiver and the promotion of the child and family of origin
relationship.
It is recommended that every child in foster care have comprehensive medical, dental, developmental, and mental health assessments
within 30 days of entering foster care. Almost every child in foster
care deserves a full mental health evaluation to assess for the impact
of trauma and loss on emotional well-­being. Psychotropic medication should only be considered, after a thorough, high-­quality,
trauma-­informed mental health evaluation by a pediatric-­trained
mental health professional. The healthcare provider should remember that the impact of trauma on the developing brain can mimic
other mental health disorders, including attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and depression (see Chapters 38, 39, and 50).
Childhood trauma may impair cognition, executive function, and
memory (see Chapter 49), so that children <6 years of age benefit
from a comprehensive developmental assessment, whereas older
children often benefit from a comprehensive psychoeducational
assessment. The child welfare professional should provide consents
for healthcare and any available health history and encourage the
appropriate involvement of the family of origin. This can be facilitated with electronic medical records, though multiple sources of
information may need to be identified, as most children have experienced fragmented care. The primary care provider can help child
welfare professionals and caregivers by obtaining and interpreting
the results of these assessments. Pediatricians, caregivers, and child
welfare professionals should share information to ensure the best
healthcare delivery.
Foster/kinship caregivers are the major therapeutic intervention of the foster care system, and pediatricians are in a unique
position to provide them with appropriate education and support.
Important topics include positive parenting strategies, supporting
children through transitions, providing a consistent and nurturing environment, and helping children heal from past trauma and
adversity (Table 10.2). All caregivers may need extensive education

SITUATION

ANTICIPATORY GUIDANCE FOR FOSTER CAREGIVERS

Preparing for visits with
family of origin

Educate foster/kinship caregivers about impact of visitation on children and ways to improve the experience for
children
Create standard routines before visit
Send familiar object with child to visit
Have child draw picture or card to give family of origin
Reassure child that foster/kinship caregiver will be there when child returns from visits
Advise all caregivers to minimize conflict with and negativity toward each other
Ideally, visits with family of origin are coached by trained professionals

Returning from visits and
other transitions

Greet child warmly and help with unpacking
Reassure safety with welcoming words, creating safe spaces in home (tent in the child’s room, child’s own special
chair, lovey object)
Establish reentry rituals, such as quiet play, reading together, active play, having a healthy snack

Relationship with family
of origin

Encourage child welfare professional to have family of origin keep child’s rituals and routines consistent with those in
foster/kinship home (vice versa when appropriate)
Focus on family of origin’s positive qualities; maintain a neutral or positive affect

Affirming and building
on child’s strengths

Encourage participation in child-­directed play
Time-­in with child
Encourage participation in normalizing activities (e.g., hobbies, sports)
“Catch the child being good,” praising positive behaviors
Give specific praise
Practice attentive listening
Provide child with words for emotions
Ignore negative behavior or redirect unless there is a safety issue

Preparing for court dates

Foster/kinship caregiver, child welfare professional or law guardian should explain purpose of court hearings to child
in simple terms
Anticipate that court outcomes may disrupt child and reassure safety; return to routines as quickly as possible

School

If changing schools, visit school together a few times and meet teacher
Check in regularly (weekly or monthly depending on need) with child’s teacher
Address need for any additional evaluation and supports, including IEP or specialized setting

Adolescence

Identify what issues demand firm limits and guidelines (e.g., curfews, no smoking, party at a friend’s house), what
issues are not important and can be left up to teen (e.g., hair length and color), and what issues are ideal for
negotiation (e.g., transportation to school function, style of dress)
Encourage responsible decision-­making by recognizing and complimenting it
Encourage and support after-­school activities
Teach driving when age and developmentally appropriate
Encourage teen to seek employment and teach job skills
Support skills in financial awareness and money management
Help teen to identify mentors and focus on the future

about behavioral and emotional problems within the context of
the child’s trauma history to remove blame and promote healing.
Minimizing conflict among parents/caregivers is extremely important because children ideally have affection and loyalty for all their
caregivers. Clinicians can promote resilience by focusing on child,
caregiver, and family of origin strengths. For teens and young adults
in foster care, the pediatrician can provide anticipatory guidance
around education, identity formation in the face of past trauma,
independent decision-­making, health promotion including reproductive health, healthy relationships, and developing the skills and
competencies needed for a successful future life. The pediatrician
can advocate for placement stability in a nurturing and responsive
family setting where caregivers possess the appropriate skills to help
children and youth heal.

Medical Evaluation of the
Foreign-­Born Child
Stacene R. Maroushek
More than 210,000 foreign-­born children (≤16 years old) enter the United
States each year as asylees (asylum seekers), refugees, and immigrants,
including international adoptees (see Chapter 9). This number does not
include undocumented children living and working in the United States,
the U.S.-­born children of foreign-­born parents, or the approximately 2.7

Chapter 11 u Medical Evaluation of the Foreign-­Born Child
million nonimmigrant visitors ≤16 years old who legally enter the United
States annually with temporary visas. With the exception of internationally
adopted children, pediatric guidelines for screening these newly arrived
children are sparse. The diverse countries of origin and patterns of infectious disease, the possibility of previous high-­risk living circumstances
(e.g., refugee camps, orphanages, foster care, rural/urban poor), the limited availability of reliable healthcare in many economically developing
countries, the generally unknown past medical histories, and interactions
with parents who may have limited English proficiency and/or varied educational and economic experiences make the medical evaluation of immigrant children a challenging but important task.
Before admission into the United States, all immigrant children are
required to have a medical examination performed by a physician designated by the U.S. Department of State in their country of origin. This
examination is limited to completing legal requirements for screening for certain communicable diseases and examination for serious
physical or mental problems that would prevent issuing a permanent
residency visa. This evaluation is not a comprehensive assessment of
the child’s health, and except in limited circumstances, laboratory or
radiographic screening for infectious diseases is not required for children <15 years old. After entry into the United States, health screenings of refugees, but not other immigrants, are recommended to be
done by the resettlement state. There is limited tracking of refugees as
they move to different cities or states. Thus many foreign-­born children
have had minimal prearrival or postarrival screening for infectious diseases or other health issues.
Immunization requirements and records also vary depending on
entry status. Internationally adopted children who are younger than
10 years are exempt from Immigration and Nationality Act regulations
pertaining to immunization of immigrants before arrival in the United
States. Adoptive parents are required to sign a waiver indicating their
intention to comply with U.S.-­recommended immunizations, whereas
older immigrants need only show evidence of up-­to-­date, not necessarily complete, immunizations before application for permanent resident
(green card) status after arrival in the United States.
Infectious diseases are among the most common medical diagnoses identified in immigrant children after arrival. Children may be
asymptomatic; therefore diagnoses must be made by screening tests
in addition to history and physical examination. Because of inconsistent perinatal screening for hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses, syphilis, and HIV and the high prevalence of certain intestinal parasites
and tuberculosis, all foreign-­born children should be screened for
these infections on arrival in the United States. Table 9.2 and Table
11.1 list suggested screening tests for infectious diseases for international adoptees or immigrants/refugees, respectively. Table 11.2 lists
incubation periods of common internationally acquired diseases. In
addition to these infections, other medical and developmental issues,
including hearing, vision, dental, and mental health assessments;
evaluation of growth and development; nutritional assessment; lead
exposure risk; complete blood cell count with red blood cell indices;
microscopic urinalysis; newborn screening (this could also be done in
nonneonates) and/or measurement of thyroid-­stimulating hormone
concentration; and examination for congenital anomalies (including
fetal alcohol syndrome) should be considered as part of the initial evaluation of any immigrant child.*
Children should be examined within 1 month of arrival in the
United States, or earlier if there are immediate health concerns, but
foreign-­born parents may not access the healthcare system with their
children unless prompted by illness, school vaccination, or other legal
requirements. It is important to assess the completeness of previous medical screenings at any first visit with a foreign-­born child.
Clinicians should be aware of potential diseases in high-­risk immigrant children and their clinical manifestations. Some diseases, such as
central nervous system cysticercosis, may have incubation periods as
long as several years and thus may not be detected during initial screening. On the basis of findings at the initial evaluation, consideration

COMMONLY ENCOUNTERED INFECTIONS
Hepatitis B

See also Chapter 406.
The prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in refugee
children ranges from 4% to 14%, depending on the country of origin,
age, and year studied. Prevalence of markers of past hepatitis B virus
(HBV) infection is higher. HBV infection is most prevalent in immigrants from Asia, Africa, and some countries in Central and Eastern
Europe, as well as the former Soviet Union (e.g., Bulgaria, Romania,
Russia, Ukraine), but also occurs in immigrants born in other countries. All immigrant children, even if previously vaccinated, coming
from high-­risk countries (HBsAg seropositivity >2%) should undergo
serologic testing for HBV infection, including both HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg (anti-­HBs), to identify current or chronic infection,
past resolved infection, or evidence of previous immunization. Because
HBV has a long incubation period (6 weeks to 6 months), the child may
have become infected at or near the time of migration, and initial testing might be falsely negative. Therefore strong consideration should be
given to a repeated evaluation 6 months after arrival for all children,
especially those from highly endemic countries. Chronic HBV infection is indicated by persistence of HBsAg for >6 months. Children with
HBsAg-­positive test results should be evaluated to identify the presence
of chronic HBV infection, which occurs in >90% of infants infected at
birth or in the first year of life and in 30% of children exposed at ages
1-­5 years. Once identified as being infected, additional testing should
be done to assess for biochemical evidence of severe or chronic liver
disease or liver cancer.

Hepatitis A

See Chapter 406.

Hepatitis C

Southeast Asia should be considered for HCV infection screening. All
children coming from Egypt, which has the highest known HCV seroprevalence (12% nationally and 40% in some villages), should be tested
for hepatitis C.

Intestinal Pathogens

Fecal examinations for ova and parasites (O&P) by an experienced
laboratory will identify a pathogen in 8–86% of immigrants and
refugees. The prevalence of intestinal parasites varies by country of
origin, time period when studied, previous living conditions (including water quality, sanitation, and access to footwear), and age, with
toddler/young school-­
aged children being the most affected. If
documented predeparture treatment was given, an eosinophil count
should be performed. An absolute eosinophil count of >400 cells/μL,
if persistently elevated for 3-­6 months after arrival, should prompt
further investigation for tissue-­invasive parasites such as Strongyloides (see Chapter 341) and Schistosoma (see Chapter 346) species (if
no predeparture ivermectin or praziquantel was given). If no documented predeparture treatment was given and screening eosinophils
are >400 cells/μL, two stool O&P specimens obtained from separate
morning stools should be examined by the concentration method or
empiric ivermectin and praziquantel given. If the child is symptomatic, including evidence of poor physical growth, but no eosinophilia is
present, a single stool specimen should also be sent for Giardia lamblia
(see Chapter 328.1) and Cryptosporidium parvum (see Chapter 329)
antigen detection. All potentially pathogenic parasites found should be
treated appropriately. All nonpregnant refugees >2 years of age coming
from sub-­Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia should be presumptively
treated with predeparture albendazole.

Tuberculosis

See also Chapter 406.
The decision to screen children should depend on history (e.g.,
receipt of blood products; traditional percutaneous procedures such as
tattooing, body piercing, circumcisions, or other exposures to reused,
unsterile medical devices) and the prevalence of hepatitis C virus
(HCV) infection in the child’s country of origin. Children from Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific countries, Africa, China, and

See also Chapter 261.
Tuberculosis (TB) commonly is encountered in immigrants from
all countries because Mycobacterium tuberculosis infects approximately
30% of the world’s population. Latent TB infection rates can be up to 60%
in populations of refugee children from some regions of North Africa
and the Middle East. Since 2007, TB Technical Instructions for Medical
Evaluation of Aliens have required that children ages 2-­14 years undergo
a TB skin test or interferon-­γ release assay if they are medically screened

in countries where the TB rate is ≥20 cases per 100,000 population. If
the testing is positive, a chest radiograph is required. If the chest film
suggests TB, cultures and three sputum smears are required, all before
arrival in the United States. Check with the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, for the
latest information (www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dq/technica.htm).

Congenital Syphilis
See Chapter 264.

HIV Infection
See Chapter 322.

IMMUNIZATIONS

See Chapter 215.
Immigrant children and adolescents should receive immunizations according to the recommended schedules in the United States
for healthy children and adolescents. Some immigrants will have
written documentation of immunizations received in their birth or
home country. Although immunizations such as bacille Calmette-­
Guérin (BCG), diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis (DTP),
poliovirus, measles, and HBV vaccines often are documented, other
immunizations, such as Haemophilus influenzae type b, mumps,
and rubella vaccines, are given less frequently, and Streptococcus
pneumoniae, human papillomavirus, meningococcal, and varicella
vaccines are given rarely. When doubt exists, an equally acceptable
alternative is to reimmunize the child. Because the rate of more
serious local reactions after DTP vaccine increases with the number of doses administered, serologic testing for antibody to tetanus
and diphtheria toxins before reimmunizing, or if a serious reaction
occurs, can decrease risk.
In children older than 6 months with or without written documentation of immunization, testing for antibodies to diphtheria and
tetanus toxoid may be considered to determine whether the child has
protective antibody concentrations. If the child has protective concentrations, the immunization series should be completed as appropriate for that child’s age. In children older than 12 months, measles,
mumps, rubella, and varicella antibody concentrations may be measured to determine whether the child is immune; these antibody
tests should not be performed in children younger than 12 months
because of the potential presence of maternal antibody.

Cultural Issues in
Pediatric Care
Lee M. Pachter and Alexandra M.S. Corley
Pediatricians live and work in a multicultural world. Among the world’s
nearly 8 billion people residing in over 200 countries, more than 6,000 languages are spoken. As the global population becomes more mobile, population diversity increases in all countries. In the United States, sources of
ethnic and cultural diversity come from indigenous groups, such as Indigenous Nation peoples and Alaskan and Hawaiian natives, groups from U.S.
territories such as Puerto Rico, recent immigrant groups, those whose heritage originates from the African diaspora and arrived to U.S. soil forcibly
via the middle passage of the transatlantic slave trade, and others whose

81

families and communities migrated to the United States from Europe and
Asia generations ago but who have retained cultural identification. U.S.
census estimates suggest that in 2020, nearly 40% of the U.S. population
self-­identified as belonging to an ethnic group other than non-­Hispanic
white. Immigrants comprise 15.4% of the U.S. population. Based on recent
estimates, 25% of children in the United States are either new immigrants
or first-­generation US citizens. Immigrants from China and India account
for the largest groups coming to the United States, followed by those from
Mexico and Latin America. This national and international diversity
allows for a heterogeneity of experience that enriches the lives of everyone.
Much of this diversity is based on varied cultural orientation.

WHAT IS CULTURE?

The concept of culture does not refer exclusively to ethnic categorizations. A common definition of cultural group is a collective that
shares common heritage, worldviews, beliefs, values, attitudes, behaviors, practices, and identity. Cultural groups can be based on identities
such as gender (cis, trans, nonbinary), sexual orientation (gay, lesbian,
straight, bisexual), age (teen culture), being deaf or hearing impaired
(deaf culture; see Chapter 55), and having neurodevelopmental differences (neurodiversity). Those who identify in such groups, to a certain
extent, may share common worldviews, attitudes, beliefs, values, practices, and identities with others in the group.
As a part of their shared experiences, many cultural groups face
oppression, which can affect their health. Therefore these cultural
groups require focused consideration from healthcare providers, and
we must critically examine societal factors like racism, sexism, ableism, and other forms of discrimination at the structural (institutional),
interpersonal, and psychologic levels as root causes of health disparities (see Chapters 2 and 2.1). These premises are particularly relevant
in a white supremacy and hegemony-­based society such as the United
States and previously colonized nations.
Medical professionals can also be considered as belonging to a specific
cultural group. Those who identify with the culture of medicine share
common theories of well-­being and disease, acceptance of the biomedical
and biopsychosocial models of health, and common practices and rituals.
As with other cultural groups, physicians and other healthcare professionals have a distinct language and share a common history, including experiencing similar preparatory courses that must be mastered for entrance
into training for the profession (a rite of passage) and a degree of socioeconomic privilege. Medical professionals subscribe to common norms
in medical practice. Young physicians learn a way to describe health and
illness that requires a new common vocabulary and an accepted structure
for communicating a patient’s history. These common beliefs, orientations,
and practices are often not shared by those outside of medicine. Therefore
any clinical interaction between a healthcare provider and a patient can be
a potential cross-­cultural interaction—between the culture of medicine and
the culture of the patient—regardless of the ethnicity or socioeconomic
status of the participants. A culturally informed and sensitized approach
to clinical communication is a fundamental skill required of all medical professionals, regardless of the demographic makeup of one’s patient
population.

Culture, Identity, and Intersectionality

We are all members of multiple cultural groups. Our identification with
different groups can be dynamic. How we identify may depend on the
context in which we find ourselves and may change over time. A gay
Latino physician may feel, at different times and in different situations,
greatest affinity with Latino culture, the culture of medicine, the “minority” culture in the United States, or his gay identity. An immigrant from
India may initially feel great connection with her Indian culture and
heritage, which may wane during periods of assimilation into American cultural life, then increase again at other points in life. Alternatively,
there may be identities that are not as flexible; a dark-­skinned person will
never be able to “pass” as White. An obese person will not have the “thin
privilege” of their underweight counterpart. In addition, multiple cultural identities can intersect. Intersectionality is a concept that expresses
the interconnected nature of the different social categorizations an individual may be connected to and how those identities interact to create systems

of disadvantage and/or privilege. Considering intersectionality helps to
understand how people who are members of multiple disenfranchised
groups may experience harm as a result of either identity or both simultaneously. For example, a Black woman’s experience with navigating both
racism and sexism might differ from how her White female colleague
deals with sexism alone. Culturally informed clinicians should never
assume to understand the cultural identity or experiences of a person
based solely on their perception of ethnic, racial, or group affiliation.

Intracultural Variability

There can be significantly different beliefs, values, and behaviors
among members of the same cultural group. There is as much variability within cultures as there is between cultures. The sources of this
variability include differences in personal psychology and philosophy,
family beliefs and practices, social context, and other demographic
differences, as well as acculturation, defined as the changes in beliefs
and practices resulting from continuous interactions with another culture. The literature on acculturation and health outcomes shows varied
effects of cultural change on health and well-­being. These differences
are in part caused by overly simplistic ways of measuring acculturation in public health and health services research. The use of acculturation proxies such as generational status (recent immigration, first
generation) and socioeconomic status as measures of acculturation
do not allow for an understanding of the complex behavioral changes
that occur during shifts in cultural orientation. Often, acculturation is
seen as a linear process where individuals move from unacculturated
to acculturated or assimilated into the host culture. This simplistic view
does not consider the reality that acculturation is multidimensional and
includes the degree to which an individual continues to identify with
her original culture-­of-­origin identity, the degree to which the host cultural orientation is adopted, and how inviting and welcoming the host
culture is. These are separate and independent processes (Fig. 12.1).
One can become bicultural (adopting the host culture while retaining
aspects of the original culture), assimilated (host culture is adopted,
but original culture is not retained), separated (original cultural orientation is retained, but host culture is not greatly adopted), or marginalized (does not adopt host culture and does not retain original
culture). These variations in the acculturation process are determined
not only by the individual going through the cultural change process
but also by the degree of acceptance of diversity in the host culture.
In theory, individuals who best adapt to the multicultural society are
those who are bicultural because they retain the strengths and assets
of their heritage culture while being able to positively adjust to host
cultural norms. However, historically and in the present day, people
from various cultural groups have taken on acculturation in a variety of
ways for different reasons (e.g., survival, safety, wealth attainment). The
acculturative process can be a source of stress and may have a negative
impact on health and contribute to health disparities. It is worth noting
that the acculturation process is one that the majority culture often has
little awareness of or participation in. Members of the majority culture should strive for cultural awareness as a foundation for a culturally
informed practice.

CULTURALLY INFORMED CARE

Physicians and patients bring to their interactions diverse orientations
from multiple cultural systems. These different belief systems and practices could have significant implications for the delivery of healthcare and
the receipt of health information. Consequently, physician cultural awareness, sensitivity, and humility are critical to successful patient-­provider
interaction.
The culturally informed physician (1) attempts to understand and
respect the beliefs, values, attitudes, and lifestyles of all patients; (2)
understands that health and illness are influenced by beliefs and practices originating from cultural orientation, linguistic considerations,
religious and spiritual beliefs, and other socially constructed affiliations; (3) has insight into their own cultural biases and does not see
cultural issues as something that only affects the patient; (4) is sensitive
to how differences in power and privilege may affect the quality of the
clinical encounter; (5) recognizes that in addition to the physiologic
aspects of disease, the culturally and psychologically constructed
meaning of illness and health is a central clinical issue; and (6) is sensitive to the role of intersectionality and intragroup variations in beliefs
and practices and avoids stereotyping based on group affiliation. These
core components of culturally informed care are important for interactions with all patients, regardless of socioeconomic status or ethnicity.
Becoming culturally informed is a developmental process. Figure 12.2
displays a framework that includes a continuum of perceptions and orientations to cultural awareness. Individuals in the denial stage perceive their
own cultural orientation as the true one, with other cultures either undifferentiated or unnoticed. In the defensive stage, other cultures are acknowledged but regarded as inferior to one’s own culture. The minimization stage
is characterized by beliefs that fundamental similarities among people
outweigh any differences and downplays the role of culture as a source of
human variation. The mistaken idea that one should be “color blind” is
an example of a common belief of individuals in the minimization stage
and ignores the important historical adverse sociopolitical events faced by
Black or other minoritized peoples.
As one moves to the acceptance stage, cultural differences are acknowledged. Further expansion and understanding lead to adaptation, where
one not only acknowledges differences but can shift frames of reference
and have a level of comfort outside one’s own cultural frame. This eventually leads to further comfort with different worldviews seen at the
integration stage, where individuals respect cultural differences and can
comfortably interact across cultures with humility and respect.

Understanding Culture in the Context of Healthcare

Cultural orientation is just one of many different perspectives that individuals draw on as they make health and healthcare decisions. Individual psychology, past experiences (including racism), religious and
spiritual views, social position, socioeconomic status (poverty), and
family norms all can contribute to a person’s health beliefs and practices as well as trust in the healthcare system.
Trust is essential to the patient–healthcare provider relationship. However, because of historical or current experiences, many cultures do not
trust the healthcare system. In the past, Black people have been subjected
to involuntary sterilization and not being treated for syphilis (the notorious Tuskegee study). Currently, Black people have received unequal pain
relief and have experienced episodes of implicit and explicit racism in our
healthcare system. These experiences create mistrust.

Chapter 12 u Cultural Issues in Pediatric Care
The concept of intersectionality also contributes to the variability of
beliefs and practices any individual subscribes to. These beliefs and practices can also change over time and may be expressed differently in different situations and circumstances. Because of the significant variability in
health beliefs and behaviors seen among members of the same cultural
group, an approach to cultural competency that emphasizes a “knowledge
set” of specific cultural health practices in different cultural groups could
lead to false assumptions and stereotyping. Knowledge is important, but it
only goes so far. Instead, an approach that focuses on the healthcare provider
acquiring skills and attitudes relating to open and effective communication
is a preferable approach to culturally effective and informed care. Such an
approach does not rely on rote knowledge of facts that may be stereotypical
or outdated. Instead, it provides a toolbox that can be used in all circumstances. The following skills can lead to a culturally informed approach to
care:
1.	Don’t assume. Presupposing that a particular patient may have certain beliefs or may act in a particular way based on stereotypic cultural group affiliation could lead to incorrect assumptions. Sources
of intracultural diversity are varied. Multiple cultural identities can
intersect and can contribute to a diversity of experiences.
2.	Practice humility. Cultural humility has been described as “the ability to maintain an interpersonal stance that is ‘other’-­oriented (or
open to the other) in relation to aspects of cultural identity.” Cultural humility goes beyond cultural competency in that it requires
the clinician to self-­reflect and acknowledge that one’s own cultural
orientation enters any transaction with a patient.
Cultural humility aims to address power imbalances between the
dominant (hospital-­medical) privileged culture and the patient. It
incorporates the patient’s life experiences. It creates a collaborative
partnership between practitioner and patient. It also pushes the provider to critically examine their own biases and presuppositions.
Cultural competency is an approach that typically focuses on the
patient’s culture, whereas cultural humility acknowledges that both
physicians and patients have cultural orientations and that a successful
relationship requires give and take among those differing perspectives.
Cultural humility also includes an understanding that differences in
social power, which are inherent in the physician-­patient relationship,
need to be understood and addressed so that open communication can
occur.
3.	Understand and address privilege. Members of the majority culture have
certain privileges and benefits that are often unrecognized and unacknowledged. For example, they are more likely to be positively represented in media such as movies and television. Compared with minoritized groups, those in the majority culture have less chance of being
followed by security guards at stores, stopped by the police, or having
their bags checked. They have a greater chance of having a positive reception in a new neighborhood or of finding food in the supermarket
that is consistent with their heritage. They have a lower likelihood of
having to deal with the burden of racism and the acculturation process.
These privileges typically go unnoticed by members of the majority culture, but their absence is painfully recognized by members of oppressed
cultural groups. The culturally informed physician should try to be
mindful of these privileges and power differentials and how they may
influence their interactions with patients. Addressing such privilege
might involve proactively centering traditionally silenced voices.
4.	Be inquisitive. Because of the significant amount of intracultural diversity of beliefs and practices noted earlier, the only way to know a
particular patient’s approach to health and illness is through direct
and effective communication. Asking about the patient’s/family’s
perspective in an inquisitive and respectful manner will usually be
met with open and honest responses, as long as the patient does not
feel looked down on and the questions are asked in genuine interest. Obtaining a health beliefs history on all patients is an effective
way of understanding clinical issues from the patient’s and family’s
perspective (Table 12.1). The health beliefs history gathers information on the patient’s views on the identification of health problems,
causes, susceptibility, signs and symptoms, concerns, treatment, and
expectations. Responses gathered from the health beliefs history can
be helpful in guiding care plans and health education interventions.

Table 12.1  The Health Beliefs History
• What do you think is wrong with your child?
• Why do you think your child has gotten it (the illness)?
• What do you think caused it?
• Why do you think it started when it did?
• What do you think is happening inside the body?
• What are the symptoms that make you know your child has this
illness?
• What problems does this illness cause your child?
• What are you most worried about with this illness?
• How long do you think it will last?
• How do you treat it?
• What will happen if it is not treated?
• What do you expect from the treatments?
Data from Kleinman A, Eisenberg L, Good B. Culture, illness and care: Clinical lessons
from anthropologic and cross-­cultural research. Ann Intern Med. 1978;88:251–258.

5.	Be flexible. As members of the culture of medicine, clinicians have been
educated and acculturated to the biomedical model as the optimal
approach to health and illness. Patients and families may have health
beliefs and practices that do not fully fit the biomedical model. Traditional beliefs and practices may be used in tandem with biomedical approaches without posing harm. An individual’s approach to health rarely is exclusively biomedical or traditional and is often a combination of
multiple approaches. The health beliefs history provides clinicians with
information regarding nonbiomedical beliefs and practices that may be
held by the patient. Culturally informed physicians should be flexible
and find ways of integrating nonharmful traditional beliefs and practices into the medical care plan to make that plan fit the patient’s needs
and worldview, while still reaching the desired health outcome. This will
likely result in better adherence to treatment and prevention.
Obtaining a health beliefs history for a child with asthma, for example,
may reveal that the family uses an alternative remedy when the symptoms first occur. If the symptoms do not resolve after giving the remedy, the family administers standard medical care. In this case, if the
alternative remedy is safe and has no significant likelihood of causing
adverse effects, the culturally informed physician might say, “I’m not
sure if the remedy you’re using is helpful or not, but I can say that if used
as you described, it’s not likely to be harmful. So, if you think it may
work, feel free to try it. But instead of waiting to give the prescription
medicine until after you see if the remedy works, why don’t you give it at
the same time you give the remedy? Maybe they’ll work well together.”
This approach shows respect for the family-­held beliefs and practices
while increasing timely adherence to the biomedical therapy.
At times, an alternative therapy may be contraindicated or may have
adverse effects. In this case it is advisable to recommend against the therapy, but whenever possible, one should attempt to replace the therapy
with another, safer, culturally acceptable treatment. If a parent is giving
a child tea containing harmful ingredients to treat a cold, the culturally
informed physician could recommend stopping the practice and explain
the concerns, but then recommend replacing the harmful tea with something safer that fits the family’s cultural belief system, such as an herbal tea
with no harmful ingredients. This requires an awareness and background
knowledge of the cultural belief system, and this approach increases the
chances that the family will follow through on the recommendation and
feel that their beliefs are respected.

Awareness-­Assessment-­Negotiation Model

Providing care in the multicultural context can be challenging, but it
offers opportunities for creativity and can result in improved long-­
term physician-­patient relationships, which will ultimately improve the
quality and outcomes of healthcare. Culturally informed care combines
knowledge with effective communication skills, an open attitude, and
the qualities of flexibility and humility.
The culturally informed physician should first become aware
of common health beliefs, practices, and communication styles

84 Part I u The Field of Pediatrics
of patients in the practice. Reading literature on particular groups
could increase awareness, but with the caution that such information may be biased, outdated, or not specific to the local context. The
best approach to becoming aware of specific health beliefs and practices is to ask—enter into conversations with patients, families, and
community members. One might say, “Other families have shared
with me that there are ways of treating this illness [or staying healthy]
that work for them, but doctors do not know about them. Sometimes
they are recommended by grandparents or others in the community.
They may be effective. Have you heard of any of these?” This approach
shows genuine interest and openness, is not based on presumptions,
and does not ask about behaviors or practices, only if the patient has
heard of these practices. If the question elicits a positive response, the
conversation can then continue, including asking whether the patient
has personally tried any of the therapies, under what circumstances,
and if they thought it was helpful. This approach shows respect for
the patient as an individual and avoids stereotyping all members of a
particular group as monolithic in their cultural beliefs and practices.
The information obtained should be seen only as common ways that
members of a community may interpret health-­related issues. Assuming
that all members subscribe to similar beliefs and practices would be incorrect and potentially damaging by promoting stereotypes. Because the unit
of measurement in clinical care is the individual patient and family, clinicians must assess to what extent a specific patient may act on these general beliefs and under what circumstances. The health beliefs history can
help the physician become aware of the specific beliefs and practices that
a patient holds and allow one to tailor the care to the individual patient.
Once the patient’s explanatory model is elicited and understood,
the clinician should be able to assess the congruity of this model and
the biomedical model, finding similarities. Then the process of negotiating can occur. Integrating patient-­held approaches to health with
evidence-­based biomedical standards of care will help place care within
the lifestyle and worldview of patients, leading to increased adherence to medical care plans, better physician-­patient communication,
enhanced long-­term therapeutic relationships, better health outcomes,
and improved patient (and physician) satisfaction. When there is a
needed behavioral change, counseling for a patient or family should
follow motivational interviewing best practices (see Chapter 18).

Maximizing Children’s
Health: Screening,
­ nticipatory Guidance,
A
and Counseling
Joseph F. Hagan Jr. and Dipesh Navsaria
Health supervision visits from birth to age 21 are the platform for a young
person’s healthcare. Routine, scheduled care of well infants, children, and
adolescents is an essential prevention effort for children and youth worldwide. The provision of well care in the medical home fosters strong relationships between the clinic or practice and the child and family, enabling
the provision of appropriate surveillance, screening, and sick care.

To ensure the optimal health of the developing child, pediatric
care in the United States and other countries evolved into regularly
scheduled visits to ensure adequate nutrition, to detect and immunize against infectious diseases, and to observe the child’s development. To foster optimal child healthy development, it is also wise
to assess the child’s or adolescent’s emotional-­behavioral health,
their parents’ mental health, their relational health, and their social
determinants of health.
Well-­
child care focuses on the health and well-­
being of the
child, but as children live in families of many varieties, it must also
address that context by evaluating the needs, strengths, opportunities, and challenges of the identified family, including parents
and other adults. Answering parents’ questions while creating an
environment where parents feel comfortable asking is an important
feature of the well-­child visit. Promoting family-­centered care and
partnership with parents increases the ability to elicit parental concerns, especially about their child’s development, learning, behavior, and social needs. Addressing of needs may be as straightforward
as supportive listening, or may include validation, and referral to
an appropriate resource whether in the community or the adult’s
own medical home. Such two-­generation approaches benefit both
the parent and the child.
Ever-­present and lying just beneath the surface of arguably of
every pediatric encounter is the phenomenon of relational health.
What is the health of the relationships within the family unit? Is
the child surrounded by safe, stable, nurturing relationships? Or
are they subject to unbuffered threats to their well-­being? Are
caregivers confident of their caregiving abilities? Do they have the
capacity to do it well? This assessment followed by efforts to bolster
relational health within families will act as a strong support to
child development that has significant implications for the life
course.
Contemporary analysis of changes in the population’s health, coupled
with the recognition that early life experiences and social factors affect
health along the entire life course, call for a supportive environment
providing positive childhood experiences that enhance the trajectory
for child development and health. But stressful circumstances impair
development, and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) early in life
increase the risk of disease (see Chapter 1). Adults who experienced
abuse, violence, or other stressors as children have an increased risk
for depression, heart disease, and other morbidities. Biology informs
us that ubuffered stress leads to increased heart rate and blood pressure and increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, cortisol, and other
stress hormones, all of which impair brain activity, immune status, and
cardiovascular function. These impacts of stress present causal models
of how ACEs, including those that could have been prevented, increase
health risk and negatively affect the life course.
Preventive care for children, youth, and families offers great
opportunity for health cost savings as a component of contemporary U.S. health reform activities. A thriving society and economy
requires educated and healthy citizens and workers. For children to
have a successful, meaningful, and useful educational experience,
they must have physical, cognitive, and emotional health. Educational success in particular is tied to early childhood developmental
competence. Well-­child care plays a vital role in promoting adult
health, a concept endorsed by business leaders as essential to building the human infrastructure of the U.S. economy and society.

THE PERIODICITY SCHEDULE AND GUIDELINES

The frequency and content for well-­child care activities are derived
from evidence-­based practice and research. In addition, federal agencies and professional organizations, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), have developed evidence-­informed, expert
consensus guidelines for care. The Recommendations for Preventive
Pediatric Health Care, or Periodicity Schedule, is a compilation of

recommendations listed by age-­based visits (Fig. 13.1). It is intended
to guide practitioners of pediatric primary care to perform certain services and intentionally make observations at age-­specific visits; it designates the standard for preventive services for U.S. children and youth
and is referred to as such in some legislation. It is updated annually and
is available online.
Comprehensive guides for care of well infants, children, and adolescents have been developed based on the Periodicity Schedule to expand
and further recommend how practitioners might accomplish the tasks
outlined. The current guideline standard is The Bright Futures Guidelines
for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents, fourth edition (https://brightfutures.aap.org/Pages/default.aspx). These guidelines
were developed by the AAP under the leadership of the Maternal Child
Health Bureau of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
in collaboration with the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, American Academy of Family Physicians, American Medical
Association, American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, Family Voices,
and others.

TASKS OF WELL-­CHILD CARE

The well-­child encounter aims to promote the physical and emotional
well-­being of children and youth. Child health professionals, including pediatricians, family medicine physicians, nurse practitioners, and
physician assistants, take advantage of the opportunity well-­child visits
provide to elicit parental questions and concerns, gather relevant family and individual health information, perform a physical examination,
and initiate screening tests. The tasks of each well-­child visit include
the following:
1.	Disease detection
2.	Disease prevention
3.	Health promotion
4.	Anticipatory guidance
To achieve these outcomes, healthcare professionals employ techniques to screen for disease—or for the risk of disease—and provide
advice about healthy behaviors. These activities lead to the formulation
of appropriate anticipatory guidance and health advice.
Clinical detection of disease in the well-­child encounter is accomplished by a careful physical examination and both surveillance and
screening. In well-­
child care, surveillance occurs in every health
encounter and is enhanced by repeated visits and observations with
advancing developmental stages. It relies on the experience of a skilled
clinician performing intentional observation over time facilitated
and informed by the observations offered by parents. Screening is a
more formal process using a validated assessment tool that has known
sensitivity and specificity. For example, anemia surveillance is accomplished through taking a dietary history and seeking signs of anemia
in the physical examination. Anemia screening is done by hematocrit
or hemoglobin tests. Developmental surveillance relies on the observations of parents and the assessment of clinicians in pediatric healthcare
who are knowledgeable about child development. Table 13.1 shows the
age at which 75% or more of children would be expected to achieve
a developmental milestone across multiple streams of development.
Developmental screening involves trained personnel scoring and interpreting a structured developmental screening tool completed by parents (see Chapter 28).
The second essential action of the well-­child encounter, disease
prevention, may include both primary prevention activities applied
to a whole population and secondary prevention activities aimed at
patients with specific risk factors. For example, counseling about
reducing fat intake is appropriate for all children and families. However, counseling is intensified for overweight and obese youth or in
the presence of a family history of hyperlipidemia and its sequelae.
The child and adolescent healthcare professional needs to individualize disease prevention strategies to the specific patient, family, and
community.
Health promotion and anticipatory guidance activities distinguish the well-­child health supervision visit from all other encounters
with the healthcare system. Disease detection and disease prevention
activities are germane to all interactions of children with physicians

85

and other healthcare clinicians, but health promotion and anticipatory
guidance shift the focus to wellness and to the strengths of the family (e.g., what is being done well and how this might be improved).
This approach is an opportunity to help the family address relationship issues; broach important safety topics; access needed services; and
engage with extended family, school, neighborhood, and community
and spiritual organizations. This is a prime area for relational health to
be conceptually housed in the mind of the skilled clinician.
It is not possible to cover all the topics suggested by comprehensive
guidelines such as Bright Futures in the average 18-­minute well-­child
visit. Child health professionals must prioritize the most important
topics to cover. Consideration should be given to a discussion of the
following:
• First and foremost, the agenda the parent or child brings to the
health supervision visit.
• The topics where evidence suggests counseling is effective in behavioral change.
• The topics where there is a clear rationale for the issue’s critical importance to health, such as sleep environment to prevent sudden
unexpected infant death (SUID) or attention to diet and physical
activity.
• A summary of the child’s progress in emotional, cognitive, and social
development; physical growth; and strengths.
• Issues that address the questions, concerns, or specific health problems relevant to the individual family.
• Community-­specific problems that could significantly affect the
child’s health (e.g., neighborhood violence from which children
need protection or the absence of bike paths that would promote
activity).

INFANCY AND EARLY CHILDHOOD

Nutrition, physical activity, sleep, safety, and emotional, social, and physical growth, along with parental well-­being, are critical for all children.
For each well-­child visit, there are topics specific to individual children
based on their age, family situation, chronic health condition, or a parental concern, such as sleep environment to prevent SUID, activities to
promote healthy weight, and fences around swimming pools. Attention
should also be focused on the family milieu and other social determinants of health, including screening for parental depression (especially
maternal postpartum depression) and other mental illness, family violence, substance abuse, nutritional inadequacy, and lack of housing. It
is equally important to identify, acknowledge, and empower family
strengths. These issues are essential to the care of young children.
Evidence-­based approaches such as early literacy assessment and promotion (e.g., Reach Out and Read) provide a structure for enquiry, surveillance, and parent coaching efficiently within the health supervision visit.
It is important to identify children with developmental disorders as
early as possible. Developmental surveillance at every visit combined
with a structured developmental screening, neuromuscular screening,
and autism screening at certain visits enhances early diagnosis, especially
for mild to moderate delays or autism spectrum disorders for which
early intervention is believed to be associated with reduced morbidity.

MIDDLE CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE

As the child enters school-­
age years, additional considerations
emerge. Attention to their developing autonomy requires fostering a
clinician-­patient relationship that begins to separate from the clinician–child-­family relationship, with increasing needs for privacy and
confidentiality as the child ages. As gender awareness develops, supportive and nonjudgmental care that is inclusive of the array of gender
identities and sexual orientations found in youth is essential, particularly for LGBTQ+ youth.
The six health behaviors that most significantly affect adolescent
and adult morbidity and mortality are inadequate physical activity, poor nutrition, sexuality-­related behaviors, substance use and
abuse (including tobacco and vaporized nicotine), unintentional
injury–related behaviors, and intentional injury–related behaviors.
New morbidities related to social media affect all contemporary

Recommendations for Preventive Pediatric Health Care
Bright Futures/American Academy of Pediatrics
Each child and family is unique; therefore, these Recommendations for Preventive Pediatric Health Care are designed
for the care of children who are receiving nurturing parenting, have no manifestations of any important health
problems, and are growing and developing in a satisfactory fashion. Developmental, psychosocial, and chronic
disease issues for children and adolescents may require more frequent counseling and treatment visits separate
from preventive care visits. Additional visits also may become necessary if circumstances suggest concerns.

These recommendations represent a consensus by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and Bright Futures.
The AAP continues to emphasize the great importance of continuity of care in comprehensive health supervision
and the need to avoid fragmentation of care.

Refer to the specific guidance by age as listed in the Bright Futures Guidelines (Hagan JF, Shaw JS, Duncan PM, eds.
Bright Futures: Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents. 4th ed. American Academy
of Pediatrics; 2017).
The recommendations in this statement do not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as a standard
of medical care. Variations, taking into account individual circumstances, may be appropriate.
The Bright Futures/American Academy of Pediatrics Recommendations for Preventive Pediatric Health Care are
updated annually.

1. If a child comes under care for the first time at any point on the schedule, or if any items are not accomplished at the
suggested age, the schedule should be brought up to date at the earliest possible time.
2. A prenatal visit is recommended for parents who are at high risk, for first-time parents, and for those who request a
conference. The prenatal visit should include anticipatory guidance, pertinent medical history, and a discussion of
benefits of breastfeeding and planned method of feeding, per “The Prenatal Visit” (https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.20181218).
3. Newborns should have an evaluation after birth, and breastfeeding should be encouraged (and instruction and
support should be offered).
4. Newborns should have an evaluation within 3 to 5 days of birth and within 48 to 72 hours after discharge from the
hospital to include evaluation for feeding and jaundice. Breastfeeding newborns should receive formal breastfeeding
evaluation, and their mothers should receive encouragement and instruction, as recommended in “Breastfeeding and
the Use of Human Milk” (https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2011-3552). Newborns discharged less than 48 hours after
delivery must be examined within 48 hours of discharge, per “Hospital Stay for Healthy Term Newborn Infants”
(https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2015-0699).
5. Screen, per “Expert Committee Recommendations Regarding the Prevention, Assessment, and Treatment of Child and
Adolescent Overweight and Obesity: Summary Report” (https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2007-2329C).
6. Screening should occur per “Clinical Practice Guideline for Screening and Management of High Blood Pressure in
Children and Adolescents” (https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2017-1904). Blood pressure measurement in infants and
children with specific risk conditions should be performed at visits before age 3 years.
7. A visual acuity screen is recommended at ages 4 and 5 years, as well as in cooperative 3-year-olds. Instrument-based
screening may be used to assess risk at ages 12 and 24 months, in addition to the well visits at 3 through 5 years of age.
See “Visual System Assessment in Infants, Children, and Young Adults by Pediatricians”
(https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2015-3596) and “Procedures for the Evaluation of the Visual System by Pediatricians”

undressed and suitably draped. See “Use of Chaperones During the Physical Examination of the Pediatric Patient”
(https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2011-0322).
18. These may be modified, depending on entry point into schedule and individual need.

19. Confirm initial screen was accomplished, verify results, and follow up, as appropriate. The Recommended Uniform
Screening Panel (https://www.hrsa.gov/advisory-committees/heritable-disorders/rusp/index.html), as determined by
The Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children, and state newborn screening
laws/regulations (https://www.babysfirsttest.org/) establish the criteria for and coverage of newborn screening
procedures and programs.
20. Verify results as soon as possible, and follow up, as appropriate.
21. Confirm initial screening was accomplished, verify results, and follow up, as appropriate. See “Hyperbilirubinemia in the
Newborn Infant ≥35 Weeks’ Gestation: An Update With Clarifications” (https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2009-0329).

of the AAP Red Book: Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases.
30. Screen adolescents for HIV at least once between the ages of 15 and 21, making every effort to preserve confidentiality
of the adolescent, as per “Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infection: Screening”
(https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/human-immunodeficiency-virus-hiv-infectio
n-screening); after initial screening, youth at increased risk of HIV infection should be retested annually or more
frequently, as per “Adolescents and Young Adults: The Pediatrician’s Role in HIV Testing and Pre- and Postexposure HIV
Prophylaxis” (https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2021-055207).
31. Perform a risk assessment for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection according to recommendations per the USPSTF
(https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/hepatitis-b-virus-infection-screening) and in
the 2021–2024 edition of the AAP Red Book: Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases, making every effort to
preserve confidentiality of the patient.
32. All individuals should be screened for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection according to the USPSTF
(https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/hepatitis-c-screening) and Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/rr/rr6902a1.htm) at
least once between the ages of 18 and 79. Those at increased risk of HCV infection, including those who are persons
with past or current injection drug use, should be tested for HCV infection and reassessed annually.
33. Perform a risk assessment, as appropriate, per “Sudden Death in the Young: Information for the Primary Care Provider”
(https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2021-052044).
34. See USPSTF recommendations
(https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/cervical-cancer-screening). Indications for
pelvic examinations prior to age 21are noted in “Gynecologic Examination for Adolescents in the Pediatric Office
Setting” (https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2010-1564).
35. Assess whether the child has a dental home. If no dental home is identified, perform a risk assessment
(https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/oral-health/oral-health-practice-tools/) and refer to a dental home. Recommend
brushing with fluoride toothpaste in the proper dosage for age. See “Maintaining and Improving the Oral Health of
Young Children” (https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2014-2984).
36. Perform a risk assessment (https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/oral-health/oral-health-practice-tools/). See
“Maintaining and Improving the Oral Health of Young Children” (https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2014-2984).
37. The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians apply fluoride varnish to the primary teeth of all infants and
children starting at the age of primary tooth eruption
(https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/prevention-of-dental-caries-in-children-youn
ger-than-age-5-years-screening-and-interventions1). Once teeth are present, apply fluoride varnish to all children every
3 to 6 months in the primary care or dental office based on caries risk. Indications for fluoride use are noted in “Fluoride
Use in Caries Prevention in the Primary Care Setting” (https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-034637).
38. If primary water source is deficient in fluoride, consider oral fluoride supplementation. See “Fluoride Use in Caries
Prevention in the Primary Care Setting” (https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-034637).

vulnerable to advertising of unhealthy products and behaviors
because of immature skills in critical thinking and impulse control. Emotional well-­being and early diagnosis and treatment of
mental health problems are crucially important, with attention to
the developmental tasks of adolescence: competence at school and
other activities, connection to friends and family, autonomy, empathy, and a sense of self-­worth.

chronic condition management and health surveillance (including
adolescent engagement and planning for transition to adult care)
occur within an effective patient care relationship, partnering to
improve health outcomes and efficiencies of current and future care
provision.

Children and Youth with Special Healthcare Needs

One fifth of primary care encounters with children are for a behavioral or
mental health problem or sickness visits complicated by a mental health
issue. Pediatricians and other primary care clinicians seeing children must
have reasonable comfort with and knowledge for diagnosis, treatment, and
referral criteria for attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder (see Chapter
50), depression and other mood disorders (see Chapter 39), anxiety (see
Chapter 38), and conduct disorder (see Chapter 42), as well as an understanding of the pharmacology of the frequently prescribed psychotropic
medications. Familiarity with available local mental health services and clinicians and knowledge of the types of services indicated are important for
effective consultation or referral. With new understanding of the impact
of lifestyle on mood disorders and anxiety, encouragement of behavioral
change to implement regular exercise, a healthy diet, avoidance of substances, and judicious use of media has become an important responsibility of the primary care clinician. Motivational interviewing (see Chapter
18) provides a structured approach that has been designed to help patients
and parents identify the discrepancy between their desire for health and

This set of frameworks must be directed at all children, including children and youth with special healthcare needs (CYSHCN).
CYSHCN are no different from other children in their need for
guidance about healthy nutrition, physical activity, progress in
school, connection with friends, a healthy sense of self-­efficacy, and
avoidance of risk-­taking behaviors. The existence of frequent visits to the medical home or specialists to address the special health
needs sometimes masks the lack of general health supervision care.
The coordination of specialty consultation, medication monitoring, and functional assessment, which should occur in their periodic visits, needs to be balanced with a discussion of the child’s
unique ways of accomplishing the emotional, social, and developmental tasks of childhood and adolescence. Comprehensive, integrated care planning for CYSHCN should support partnerships
between family-­centered medical homes and families and youth
through goal setting and negotiating next steps. In this process,

Strength-­Based Approaches and Framework

Questions about school or extracurricular accomplishments or competent
personal characteristics should be integrated into the content of the well
child visit. Such inquiries set a positive context for the visit, deepen the
partnership with the family, acknowledge the child’s healthy development,
and facilitate discussing social-­emotional development with children and
their parents. There is a strong relationship between appropriate social-­
emotional development (e.g., children’s strong connection to their family,
social friends, and mentors; competence; empathy; appropriate autonomy)
and decreased participation in all the risk behaviors of adolescence (related
to drugs, sex, and violence). An organized approach to the identification
and encouragement of a child’s strengths during health supervision visits
provides both the child and the parent with an understanding of how to
promote healthy achievement of the developmental tasks of childhood and
adolescence. It also provides an opportunity to assess and comment on the
relational health in the family. CYSHCN often have a different timetable,
but they have an equal need to be encouraged to develop strong family and
peer connections, competence in a variety of arenas, ways to do things for
others, and appropriate independent decision-­making.

Family Support Programs

Family support can range from the informal, to the highly formalized,
to the referral to other agencies. Informal supports can be incorporated easily into existing assessment or anticipatory guidance. More
formalized programs incorporate clinician and clinic staff training
and guidance for the family while still operating within the existing framework of the well-­child visit, such as Reach Out and Read.
Even more structured are programs such as HealthySteps or Video
Interaction Project, which address deeper needs for support through
additional personnel and time. Finally, agencies external to the medical home, like evidence-­based home visiting, can offer even greater
intensity or flexibility of service.
This continuum of offerings allows a clinician to “tune” the intensity
of services to meet the needs of a family while maintaining the support
and connection of the medical home in the face of the reality of families
who have needs far beyond what can be addressed immediately. Family
support programs should be selected and offered based on available
evidence and strong elements of reproducibility, scalability, and clarity.
Advocacy for funding for family support programs is also imperative.

Office System Change for Quality Improvement

To facilitate the effective delivery of preventive services for children
and youth, screening schedules and parent handouts, flow sheets, registries, and parent and youth previsit questionnaires are available in
The Bright Futures Guidelines Toolkit. These efforts are part of a larger
national effort that is built on a coordinated team approach in the office
setting and the use of continuous measurement for improvement.

EVIDENCE

Available evidence should be used in developing health-­promotion
and disease-­detection recommendations. Revisions to the AAP Periodicity Schedule undergo rigorous evidence assessment; however,
many highly valued well-­child care activities have not been evaluated for efficacy. Lack of evidence is most often related to absence of
systematic study and does not necessarily mean lack of benefit. Thus
the clinical encounter with the well child is also guideline and recommendation driven and requires the integration of clinician goals,
family needs, and community realities in seeking better health for
the child. The evidence and rationale for recommendations in the
Periodicity Schedule (see Fig. 13.1) and Bright Futures Guidelines
regarding well-­child care activities are a balance of evidence from
research, clinical practice guidelines, professional recommendations,
expert opinion, experience, and knowledge of the needs of the patient

population in the context of community assets and challenges. Clinical or counseling decisions and recommendations may also be based
on local legislation (e.g., seat belts), on commonsense measures not
likely to be studied experimentally (e.g., lowering water heater temperatures, use of car seats), or on the basis of relational evidence (e.g.,
television watching associated with violent behavior in young children). Most importantly, sound clinical and counseling decisions are
responsive to family needs and desires and support patient-­centered
decision-­making.

CARING FOR THE CHILD AND YOUTH IN THE
CONTEXT OF THE FAMILY AND COMMUNITY

A successful primary care practice for children incorporates families,
is family centered, and embraces the concept of the medical home. To
be considered a medical home, a primary care practice must certify
that their care is accessible, continuous, comprehensive, family centered, coordinated, compassionate, and culturally effective. In a medical home, a clinician works in partnership with the family and patient
to ensure that all medical and nonmedical needs of the child are met.
Through this partnership, the child healthcare professional helps the
family/patient access and coordinate specialty care, educational services, out-­of-­home care, family support, and other public and private
community services that are important to the overall health of the child
and family.
Health promotion activities occur not only in the medical home but
also through community members and other health and education professionals. To be most effective, communication and coordination around
providing accurate, consistent information is key, with a clear understanding of the important role that the community plays in supporting healthy
behaviors among families. Communities where children and families feel
safe and valued and have access to positive activities and relationships provide the important base that the healthcare professional can build on and
refer to for needed services that support health but are outside the realm
of the healthcare system or primary care medical home. It is important for
the medical home and community agencies to identify mutual resources,
communicate well with families and each other, and partner in designing service delivery systems. This interaction is the practice of community
pediatrics, whose unique feature is its concern for all the population: those
who remain well but need preventive services, those who have symptoms
but do not receive effective care, and those who do seek medical care in a
physician’s office or hospital.
Contemporary and future health supervision of children and adolescents must evolve to improve the delivery of this comprehensive care,
which is critical to the healthy development of every child, their family,
and their community. Relevant practice models for delivery of health
supervision care will continue to evolve to provide comprehensive
care and partnership with medical and community services to serve
their patients and families. Such models will appropriately broaden the
sphere of primary care pediatrics and foster partnerships in community care. Pediatric clinicians should also advocate not only for individual patients but also for system change for the betterment of this
and future generations.
Health reform is key to this work to assure that an evidence-­based,
comprehensive system of health supervision is supported. Payment
modalities might vary, but payment must recognize that the work of
healthcare and the essential work of those providing preventive care
to children is poorly recognized, supported, and remunerated by most
existing payment systems. The success of accountable care organizations and any other current or future healthcare system can and should
require strengthening and broadening primary care preventive services. This reform must acknowledge and embrace the already existing
reality that preventive care is so much more than merely height, weight,
and immunizations.

Chapter 14 u Injury Control 91

Chapter 14

Injury Control
Brian D. Johnston and Sadiqa Kendi
In all high-­income countries of the world, and increasingly in many
low-­and middle-­income countries, injuries are the most common
cause of death during childhood and adolescence beyond the first few
months of life (Table 14.1 and Fig. 14.1). Injuries represent one of the
most important causes of preventable pediatric morbidity and mortality in the United States. Identification of risk factors for injuries has led
to the development of successful programs for prevention and control.
Strategies for injury prevention and control should be pursued by the
pediatrician in the office, emergency department (ED), hospital, and
community setting.
Injuries have identifiable risk and protective factors that can be used
to define prevention strategies. The term accident implies a chance
event occurring without pattern or predictability. In fact, most injuries
occur under predictable circumstances to children and families known
to be at risk. Most injuries are preventable.
Reduction of morbidity and mortality from injuries can be accomplished not only through primary prevention (averting the event or
injury) but also through secondary and tertiary prevention. The latter two approaches include appropriate emergency medical services
(EMS) for injured children; regionalized trauma care for the child
with multiple injuries, severe burns, or traumatic brain injury; and
specialized pediatric rehabilitation services to optimize functional
recovery after injury.
Injury control also encompasses intentional injuries (assaults and
self-­inflicted injuries). These injuries are important in adolescents and
young adults, and in some populations, these rank first or second as
causes of death in these age-­groups. Many of the same principles of
injury control can be applied to these problems; for example, limiting
access to firearms may reduce unintentional shootings and also homicides and suicides.

SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM
Mortality

In the United States, injuries cause 41% of deaths among 1-­to
4-­year-­old children and 3.2 times more deaths than the next leading
cause, congenital anomalies. For the rest of childhood and adolescence up to age 19 years, 65% of deaths are a result of injuries, more
than all other causes combined. In 2019, injuries caused 13,384 deaths
(16.4 deaths per 100,000 population) among individuals ≤19 years old
in the United States, resulting in more years of potential life lost than
any other cause. Unintentional injuries remained the leading cause of
death among those <24 years old in 2019 (see Table 14.1).
Motor vehicle injuries lead the list of injury deaths among school-­
age children and adolescents and are the second leading cause of injury
death for those age 1-­4 years. In children and adults, motor vehicle
occupant injuries account for most of these deaths. During adolescence,
occupant injuries are the leading cause of injury death, accounting for
>50% of unintentional trauma mortality in this age-­group.
Drowning ranks second overall as a cause of unintentional injury
deaths among those age 1-­19 years, with peaks in the preschool and
later teenage years (see Chapter 88). In some areas of the United States,
drowning is the leading cause of injury death for preschool-­age children. The causes of drowning deaths vary with age and geographic area.
In young children, bathtub and swimming pool drowning predominates, whereas in older children and adolescents, drowning occurs in
natural bodies of water while swimming or boating.
Fire-­and burn-­related deaths account for 3% of all unintentional
trauma deaths, with the highest rates among those <5 years of age (see
Chapter 89). Most deaths are a result of house fires and are caused by

smoke inhalation or asphyxiation rather than severe burns. Children
and elderly persons are at greatest risk for these deaths when they cannot independently escape from burning buildings.
Suffocation represents approximately 87% of all unintentional
deaths in children <1 year old. Some cases result from choking on
food items, such as hot dogs, candy, grapes, and nuts. Nonfood items
that can cause choking include undersized infant pacifiers, small balls,
and latex balloons. An increasing number of infant suffocation deaths
represent sleep-­related mortality in the presence of unsafe bedding or
crib bumpers, or when co-­sleeping with an impaired adult. In previous
years these might have been classified as sudden infant death syndrome
(see Chapter 423).
Homicide is the third leading cause of injury death in children 1-­4
years old and in adolescents (15-­19 years old) (Fig. 14.2). Homicide
in the pediatric age-­group falls into two patterns: infant (child) and
adolescent. Child homicide involves children <5 years old and represents child abuse (see Chapter 17). The perpetrator is usually a caretaker; death is generally the result of blunt trauma to the head and/
or abdomen. The adolescent pattern of homicide involves peers and
acquaintances and is caused by firearms in 77.6% of cases. The majority of these deaths involve handguns. Children between these two age-­
groups experience homicides of both types.
Suicide is rare in children <10 years old; however, the rate increases
greatly after age 10 years, with the result that suicide is now the second
leading cause of death for 10-­to 19-­year-­olds. Approximately 50.6% of
teenage suicides involve firearms (see Chapter 40).
There has been a sharp and substantial increase in unintentional
poisoning deaths among teens and young adults. In 2019, unintentional poisonings were the second leading cause of injury deaths
among 15-­to 24-­year-­olds. Many of these were from prescription analgesic and opioid medications such as fentanyl.
­

Nonfatal Injuries

Most childhood injuries do not result in death. Approximately 12% of
children and adolescents receive medical care for an injury each year
in hospital EDs, and at least as many are treated in physicians’ offices.
Of these, 2% require inpatient care, and 55% have at least short-­term
disability because of their injuries.
The distribution of nonfatal injuries is very different from that of
fatal trauma (Fig. 14.3). Falls are the leading cause of both ED visits
and hospitalizations. Bicycle-­related trauma is the most common type
of sports and recreational injury, accounting for approximately 300,000
ED visits annually. Nonfatal injuries may be associated with severe
morbidity such as anoxic encephalopathy from near-­drowning, scarring and disfigurement from burns, and persistent neurologic deficits
from head injury, leading to substantial changes in the quality of life
for victims and their families. In 2010, nonfatal injuries to U.S. children
<19 years old resulted in >$32 billion in direct medical and lifetime
work-­loss costs.

Global Child Injuries

Child injuries are a global public health issue, and prevention efforts
are necessary in low-­, middle-­, and high-­income countries. Between
1990 and 2010 there was a 53% decrease in mortality of people of all
ages from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders, whereas injury mortality decreased by only 16% (Fig. 14.4).
Worldwide, almost 1 million children and adolescents die from injuries and violence each year, and >90% of these deaths are in low-­and
middle-­income countries. As child mortality undergoes an epidemiologic transition because of better control of infectious diseases and
malnutrition, injury increasingly becomes a leading cause of death
for children in the developing world, as it now is in all industrialized
countries. Drowning is the fifth most common cause of death for 5-­to
9-­year-­old children globally, and in some countries, such as Bangladesh, it is the leading cause of death among children 1-­4 years old, with
a rate over 50 times greater than that in the United States.
An estimated 1 billion people do not currently have immediate
access to roads; as industrialization and motorization spread, the
incidence of motor vehicle crashes, injuries, and fatalities will climb.

child injuries and consequent morbidity and mortality is feasible with
multifaceted approaches, many of which are low cost and of proven
effectiveness.

Fig. 14.1 Global injury deaths, persons <20 years old, by mechanism,
in 2019. (From Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network, Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 [GBD 2019] Results. Seattle, United
States: Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation [IHME], 2020. Available from http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-­results-­tool.)

The rate of child injury death in low-­and middle-­income countries
is threefold higher than that in high-­income countries and reflects
both a higher incidence of many types of injuries and a much higher
case fatality rate in those injured because of a lack of access to emergency and surgical care. As in high-­income countries, prevention of

Injury prevention once centered on attempts to pinpoint the innate
characteristics of a child that result in greater frequency of injury. Most
now discount the theory of the “accident-­prone child.” For example,
although longitudinal studies have demonstrated an association
between attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; see Chapter 50) and increased rates of injury, the sensitivity and specificity of
these traits as a test to identify individuals at high risk for injury are
extremely low. The concept of accident proneness is counterproductive in that it shifts attention away from more modifiable factors, such
as product design or the built environment. It is more appropriate to
examine the physical and social environment of children with frequent
rates of injury than to try to identify personality traits or temperaments, which are difficult to modify.
Efforts to control injuries include education or persuasion, changes
in product design, and modification of the social and physical environment. Efforts to persuade individuals, particularly parents, to change
their behaviors have constituted the greater part of injury control
efforts. Speaking with parents specifically about using child car seat
restraints and bicycle helmets, installing smoke detectors, and checking the tap water temperature is likely to be more successful than offering well-­meaning but too-­general advice about supervising the child
closely, being careful, and childproofing the home. This information
should be geared to the developmental stage of the child and presented in moderate doses in the form of anticipatory guidance at
well-­child visits. Table 14.2 lists topics to discuss at each developmental

stage. It is important to acknowledge that there are many barriers to
prevention adherence beyond simple knowledge acquisition; pediatricians should be familiar with low-­cost sources for safety equipment
such as bicycle helmets, smoke detectors, trigger locks, and car seats
in their community.

The most successful injury prevention strategies generally are those
involving changes in product design. These passive interventions
protect all individuals in the population, regardless of cooperation or
level of skill, and are likely to be more successful than measures that
require repeated behavioral actions by the parent or child. The most
important and effective product changes have been in motor vehicles,
in which protection of the passenger compartment, use of airbags, and
development of crash avoidance and driving support technologies have
had large effects on injury risk. Reducing the factory-­set water heater
temperature, installing smoke detectors, and using child-­resistant caps
on medicines and household products are other examples of effective
product modifications. Many interventions require both active and
passive measures: smoke detectors provide passive protection when
fully functional, but behavior change is required to ensure periodic
battery changes and proper testing.
Modification of the environment often requires greater changes
than individual product modification but may be very effective in
reducing injuries. Safe roadway design, decreased traffic volume and
speed limits in neighborhoods, and elimination or safe storage of guns
in households are examples of such interventions. Included in this concept are changes in the social environment through legislation, such
as laws mandating child seat restraint and seatbelt use, zero-­tolerance
laws for alcohol-­impaired driving, and graduated driver’s licensing
laws.
Prevention campaigns combining two or more of these approaches
have been particularly effective in reducing injuries. The classic example is the combination of legislation and education to increase child
seat restraint and seatbelt use; other examples are programs to promote
bike helmet use among school-­aged children and improvements in
occupant protection in motor vehicles.

RISK FACTORS FOR CHILDHOOD INJURIES

Major factors associated with an increased risk of injuries to children
include age, sex, socioeconomic status, rural-­urban location, and the
environment.

children acquire mobility and exploratory behavior. Young school-­
age children are at greatest risk for pedestrian injuries, bicycle-­
related injuries (the most serious of which usually involve motor
vehicles), motor vehicle occupant injuries, burns, and drowning. During the teen years, there is a greatly increased risk from
motor vehicle occupant trauma, a continued risk from drowning
and burns, and the new risk of intentional trauma. Sports-­and
recreation-­
related injuries, including concussion, become more
common, and more serious, as children age. Work-­related injuries
associated with child labor, especially for 14-­to 16-­year-­olds, are an
additional risk.
Injuries occurring at a particular age represent a period of vulnerability during which a child or an adolescent encounters a new task
or hazard that they may not have developed the cognitive, socioemotional, or physical skills to handle successfully. Toddlers do not
have the judgment to know that medications can be poisonous or
that some houseplants are not to be eaten; they do not understand
the hazard presented by a swimming pool or an open second-­story
window. For young children, parents may inadvertently set up this
mismatch between the skills of the child and the demands of the
task. Many parents expect young school-­age children to walk home
from school, the playground, or the local convenience store, tasks for
which most children are not developmentally ready. Likewise, the
lack of skills and experience to handle many tasks during the teenage
years contributes to an increased risk of injuries, particularly motor
vehicle injuries. The high rate of motor vehicle crashes among 15-­
to 17-­year-­olds is caused primarily by inexperience, but also reflects
their level of cognitive development and emotional maturity. Alcohol, other drugs, and distraction from mobile phone use substantially
add to these limitations.
Age also influences the severity of injury and the risk of long-­term
disability. Young school-­age children have an incompletely developed
pelvis. In a motor vehicle crash, a seatbelt does not anchor onto the
pelvis but rides up onto the abdomen, resulting in the risk of serious abdominal injury. Proper restraint for 4-­to 8-­year-­old children
requires the use of booster seats. Children <2 years old have much
poorer outcomes from traumatic brain injuries than older children

and adolescents, partly related to the unique severity of abusive head
trauma.

Gender

Beginning at 1-­2 years of age and continuing throughout the life
span, males have higher rates of fatal injury than do females. During
childhood, this does not appear to be primarily a result of developmental differences between the genders, differences in coordination, or differences in muscle strength. Variation in exposure to risk
may account for the male predominance in some types of injuries.
Although males in all age-­groups have higher rates of bicycle-­related
injuries, adjusting for exposure reduces this excess risk. Gender differences in rates of pedestrian injuries do not appear to be caused by
differences in the amount of walking but rather reflect differences
in behavior between young females and males; whether these are
genetic or the result of gender socialization is uncertain. Greater
risk-­taking behavior, combined with greater frequency of alcohol
use, may lead to the disproportionately high rate of motor vehicle
crashes among teenage males. The rate of violence-­related injuries
is higher among males because of their higher rates of aggression
and risk-­taking behaviors.

Socioeconomic Status

Poverty is one of the most important risk factors for childhood injury.
Mortality from fires, motor vehicle crashes, and drowning is 2-­4 times
higher in poor children. Death rates have an inverse relationship to
income level: the higher the income level, the lower the death rate.
Many other identified injury risk factors, such as single-­parent families,

Chapter 14 u Injury Control 95
teenage parents, multiple care providers, family stress, and having multiple siblings, are also mediated primarily through their strong association with poverty.

Rural-­Urban Location

Injury rates are generally higher in rural than in urban areas. Homicide rates are higher in urban areas, as is violent crime in general.
However, suicide among adolescents is higher in rural than in urban
areas. Case fatality from injury is generally twice as high in rural
areas than in urban areas, reflecting both the increased severity of
some injuries (e.g., motor vehicle crashes occurring at higher speeds)
and poorer access to EMS and definitive trauma care. Some injuries
are unique to rural areas, such as agricultural injuries to children and
adolescents.

Environment

Poverty increases the risk of injury to children at least in part through
its effect on the environment. Children who are poor are at increased
risk for injury because they are exposed to more hazards in their living
environments. They may live in poor housing, which is more likely to
be dilapidated and less likely to be protected by smoke detectors. The
roads in their neighborhoods are more likely to be major thoroughfares. Their neighborhoods are more likely to experience higher levels
of violence, and they are more likely to be victims of assault than children and adolescents living in the suburbs. The focus on the environment is also important because it directs attention away from relatively
immutable factors, such as family dynamics, child temperament, and
race and directs efforts toward factors that can be changed through
interventions.

Ethnic Disparities

In the United States, Indigenous Nation children have the highest
death rate from unintentional injuries, followed by Black, Hispanic,
and White children. These discrepancies are even more pronounced
for some injuries. The homicide rate for Black children aged 15-­
19 years was 34.86 per 100,000 population in 2019 compared with
7.67/100,000 for Indigenous Nations and Alaskan Natives and
3.86/100,000 for Whites and 2.72/100,000 for Asians. The suicide
rate for Indigenous Nation youth was 2.1 times the rate for Whites

Table 14.3

and 3.2 times the rate for Blacks. Disparities in fatal drowning rates
vary by age, with highest rates in the 1-­to 4-­year-­old age group in
Indigenous Nation and Alaskan Native children (4.1/100,000) and
in the 5-­to 9-­and 10-­to 14-­year-­old age-­groups in Black children
(1.5/100,000 and 1.6/100,000, respectively). Indigenous Nation
teenagers 15-­19 years old are at the highest risk for suicide, followed
by White males; Black females have the lowest rate of suicide in this
age-­group.
It is important to acknowledge racial disparities in injury rates
and recognize that the underlying risk factors are racism and social
determinants of health (such as socioeconomic status, the educational status of parents, natural and built environment conditions,
and access to timely high-­quality trauma care), rather than race
itself.

MECHANISMS OF INJURY
Motor Vehicle Injuries

Motor vehicle injuries are the leading cause of serious and fatal injuries for children and adolescents. Large and sustained reductions
in motor vehicle crash injuries can be accomplished by identifiable
interventions.

Occupants

Injuries to passenger vehicle occupants are the predominant cause of
motor vehicle deaths among children and adolescents. The peak injury
and death rate for both males and females in the pediatric age-­group
occurs between 15 and 19 years (see Table 14.1). Proper restraint use
in vehicles is one of the most effective methods for preventing serious
or fatal injury in children involved in motor vehicle crashes. Table 14.3
shows the recommended restraints at different ages. Figure 14.5 provides examples of car safety seats.
Much attention has been given to child occupants <8 years old. Use
of child-­restraint devices, infant car seats, and booster seats can be
expected to reduce fatalities by 71% and the risk of serious injuries by
67% in this age-­group. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have
laws mandating their use, although the upper age limit for booster seat
requirements varies by state. Physician reinforcement of the positive
benefits of child seat restraints has been successful in improving parent
acceptance.

A detailed guide and list of acceptable devices is available from the
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)* and the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).† Infants may use an infant seat
within the height and weight guidelines of the seat or may be placed in
a convertible infant-­toddler child-­restraint device. Infants and toddlers
should remain rear facing until at least 2 years old and up to the weight and
height limits of their seat. Once toddlers outgrow the rear-­facing limits of
their seat, they can be placed in a forward-­facing child harness seat until
it is outgrown. Emphasis must be placed on the correct use of these seats,
including placing the seat in the right direction, routing the belt properly,
and ensuring that the child is buckled into the rear seat of the car correctly. Government regulations specific to automobile and product design,
including the Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children (LATCH) system,
have made the fit between car seats and the car easier, quicker, and less
prone to error.

Older children are often not adequately restrained. Many ride in the
rear seat restrained with lap belts only. Booster seats have been shown
to decrease the risk of injury by 59% and should be used by children
once they outgrow their forward-­facing child harness seat until at least
8 years of age and 4 ft 9 in (145 cm) tall. Many states have extended
their car seat laws to include children of booster seat age as well. Shoulder straps placed behind the child or under the arm do not provide
adequate crash protection and may increase the risk of serious injury.
The use of lap belts alone has been associated with an increased risk of
seatbelt-­related injuries, especially fractures of the lumbar spine and
hollow-­viscus injuries of the abdomen. These flexion-­distraction injuries of the spine are often accompanied by injuries to the abdominal
organs.
The rear seat is clearly much safer than the front seat for both children and adults. One study of children <15 years old found that the
risk of injury in a crash was 70% lower for children in the rear seat
compared with those sitting in the front seat. Frontal airbags present
a risk of serious or fatal injury from the airbag itself for children <13
years. Side airbags also pose a risk for children who are in the front seat
and are leaning against the door at the time of a crash. The safest place
for children is in the rear middle seat, properly restrained for their
age and size. Educational and legislative interventions to increase the
number of children traveling in the rear seat have been successful.
Children riding in the rear bed of pickup trucks are at special risk for
injury because of the possibility of ejection from the truck and resultant serious injury. Preschool or younger children riding in a school
bus should use a proper child restraint system. Older children (usually
>65 lb) can ride safely in a large (>16 passenger) school bus because of
compartmentalization of the bus. Smaller buses require child restraint
systems with seat belts, and seat belts are recommended for all new
school buses.
Transportation of premature infants presents special challenges.
The possibility of oxygen desaturation, sometimes associated with bradycardia, among premature infants while in child seat restraints has
led the American Association of Pediatrics (AAP) to recommend an
observed trial of infants born at <37 weeks of gestational age in the
seat before discharge and the use of oxygen or alternative restraints for
infants who experience desaturation or bradycardia, such as seats that
can be reclined and used as a car bed.

Teenage Drivers

Drivers 15-­17 years old have more than twice the rate of collisions
compared with motorists 18 years and older. Formal driver education courses for young drivers appear to be ineffective as a primary
means of decreasing the number of collisions. The risk of serious injury
and mortality is directly related to the speed at the time of the crash
and inversely related to the size of the vehicle. Small, fast cars greatly
increase the risk of a fatal outcome in the event of a crash.
The number of passengers traveling with teen drivers influences the
risk of a crash. The risk of death for 17-­year-­old drivers is 50% greater
when driving with one passenger compared with driving alone; this
risk is 2.6-­fold higher with two passengers and 3-­fold higher with three
or more passengers.
Teens driving at night are overrepresented in crashes and fatal crashes,
with nighttime crashes accounting for >33% of teen motor vehicle fatalities. Almost 50% of fatal crashes involving drivers <18 years old occur in
the 4 hours before or after midnight. Teens are 5-­10 times more likely to
be in a fatal crash while driving at night compared with driving during
the day. The difficulty of driving at night combined with the inexperience
of teen drivers appears to be a deadly combination.
Another risk factor for motor vehicle crashes for people of all ages,
including teens, is distracted driving. Distracting events can include
visual distraction (taking eyes from the forward roadway), manual distraction (removing hands from vehicle controls), or cognitive distraction (taking attention from navigating the vehicle or responding to critical events).
Electronic devices present all three modes of distraction in combination
and are increasingly recognized as a major threat to driver safety, especially
among teens. The recent uptick in motor vehicle fatality rates per vehicle
mile driven is generally believed to be caused by distracted driving.

Chapter 14 u Injury Control 97
In 2017, 39.2% of teen drivers reported they had texted or emailed while
driving in the last 30 days. Dialing on a cell phone increases the risk of a
crash almost threefold, and texting may increase the risk as much as sixfold. Although most states have banned text messaging for all drivers, the
effect of state laws on prohibiting such behavior while driving is unknown.
Parents should set limits on the use of these devices by their teens; technologic interventions that can block cell phone signals in a moving vehicle are
also available and should be considered by parents for their teens.
Newer vehicles are increasingly equipped with driver assistance
technology, electronic stability control, and automated crash avoidance
systems. Despite the potential to reduce road traffic crashes and injury,
these technologies are not yet prevalent in the vehicular fleet. In addition, there is evidence that many drivers do not understand the use, or
limitations, of these technologies.
Graduated driver’s licensing (GDL) programs consist of a series of
steps over a designated period before a teen can receive full, unrestricted
driving privileges. In a three-­stage graduated license, the student driver
must first pass vision and knowledge-­based tests, followed by obtaining
a learner’s permit, and once a specific age has been achieved and driving skills advanced, the student driver is eligible to take the driving test.
Once given a provisional license, the new driver will have a specified
time to do low-­risk driving. GDL usually places initial restrictions on
the number of passengers (especially teens) allowed in the vehicle and
limits driving at night. The number of crashes decreases 10–30% among
the youngest drivers in states with a GDL system. The characteristics of
GDL programs vary substantially across states. Optimal safety benefits
depend on parent monitoring and engagement with teens around driving restrictions and responsibilities. Parent–­teen driving contracts are
available and help to facilitate these discussions.
Alcohol use is a major cause of motor vehicle trauma among adolescents. The combination of inexperience in driving and inexperience
with alcohol is particularly dangerous. Approximately 20% of all deaths
from motor vehicle crashes in this age-­group are the result of alcohol
intoxication, with impairment of driving seen at blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) as low as 0.05 g/dL. In 2019, approximately 16.7% of
adolescents reported riding with a driver who had been drinking, and
5.4% reported driving after drinking. All states have adopted a zero-­
tolerance policy to adolescent drinking while driving, which defines any
measurable alcohol content as legal intoxication. All adolescent motor
vehicle injury victims should have their BAC measured in the ED and
should be screened for high-­risk alcohol use with a validated screening
test (e.g., CRAFFT (https://crafft.org/); Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT]) to identify those with alcohol abuse problems
(see Chapter 157.1). Individuals who have evidence of alcohol abuse
should not leave the ED or hospital without plans for appropriate alcohol abuse treatment. Interventions for problem drinking can be effective in decreasing the risk of subsequent motor vehicle crashes. Even
brief interventions in the ED using motivational interviewing can be
successful in decreasing adolescent problem drinking.
Another cause of impaired driving is marijuana use. In 2017, nearly
20% of high school students reported using marijuana in the prior 30
days, and 50% of current teen users reported driving after use. Marijuana is currently legal (2021) for adult use in 19 U.S. states and for
medical use in 27 states, while being considered in many others; the
effects of this on adolescent injury remain to be determined. Marijuana
is often co-­ingested with alcohol or other drugs, and blood thresholds
for biologic impairment have not been standardized. It is therefore difficult to estimate the independent effect of marijuana on crash risk.

All-­Terrain Vehicles

All-­terrain vehicles (ATVs) in many parts of the United States are an
important cause of injuries to children and adolescents. These vehicles
can attain high speeds, especially with low-­weight children, and are
prone to rollover because of their high center of gravity. Orthopedic
and head injuries are the most common serious injuries seen among
children involved in ATV crashes. Helmets can significantly decrease
the risk and severity of head injuries among ATV riders, but current
use is very low. Voluntary industry efforts to decrease the risk of injuries appear to have had little effect in making ATVs safer. The AAP recommends that children <16 years old should not ride or drive ATVs.

Bicycle Injuries

Each year in the United States, approximately 122,000 children and
adolescents are treated in EDs for bicycle-­related injuries, making this
one of the most common reasons that children with trauma visit EDs.
The majority of severe and fatal bicycle injuries involve head trauma.
A logical step in the prevention of these head injuries is the use of helmets. Helmets are very effective, reducing the risk of all head injury by
85% and the risk of traumatic brain injury by 88%. Helmets also reduce
injuries to the mid and upper face by as much as 65%. Pediatricians
can be effective advocates for the use of bicycle helmets and should
incorporate this advice into their anticipatory guidance schedules
for parents and children. Appropriate helmets are those with a firm
polystyrene liner that fits properly on the child’s head. Parents should
avoid buying a larger helmet to give the child “growing room.” If a crash
occurs and the helmet is struck, it should be replaced.
Promotion of helmet use can and should be extended beyond the pediatrician’s office. Community education programs spearheaded by coalitions
of physicians, educators, bicycle clubs, and community service organizations have been successful in promoting the use of bicycle helmets to children across the socioeconomic spectrum, resulting in helmet use rates of
≥70% with a concomitant reduction in the number of head injuries. Passage of bicycle helmet laws also leads to increased helmet use.
Consideration should also be given to other types of preventive
activities, although the evidence supporting their effectiveness is limited. Bicycle paths are a logical method for separating bicycles and
motor vehicles.

Ski-­and Snowboard-­Related Head Injuries

The increasing use of helmets in snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, is encouraging because head injuries are the most common
cause of death in these sports, and helmets reduce the risk of head
injury by ≥50%. Use of helmets does not result in skiers or snow boarders taking more risks and should be encouraged in all snow sports at all
ages, not just for young children.

Pedestrian Injuries

Pedestrian injuries are a major cause of traumatic death for children
and adolescents in the United States and in most high-­income countries. In low-­income countries, a much higher proportion of road
traffic fatalities are pedestrians, especially among 5-­to 14-­year-­olds.
Although case fatality rates are <5%, serious nonfatal injuries constitute a much larger problem, resulting in 29,233 ED visits in 2019 for
children and adolescents. Pedestrian injuries are the most important
cause of traumatic coma in children and a frequent cause of serious
lower-­extremity fractures, particularly in school-­age children.
Most pedestrian injuries occur during the day, with a peak in the
after-­school period; thus improved lighting or reflective clothing would
be expected to prevent few injuries. Surprisingly, approximately 30% of
pedestrian injuries occur while the individual is in a marked crosswalk,
reflecting a false sense of security and decreased vigilance in these areas.
The risk of pedestrian injury is greater in neighborhoods with high traffic volumes, speeds >25 miles/hr, absence of play space adjacent to the
home, household crowding, and low socioeconomic status.
One important risk factor for childhood pedestrian injuries is the developmental level of the child. Children <5 years old are at risk for being run
over in the driveway. Few children <9 or 10 years of age have the developmental skills to successfully negotiate traffic under all circumstances.
Young children have poor ability to judge the distance and speed of traffic
and are easily distracted by playmates or other factors in the environment.
Many parents are not aware of this mismatch between the abilities of the
young school-­age child and the skills needed to cross streets safely. The
use of mobile phones and devices has become increasingly common while
walking and can increase the risk of being struck by a motor vehicle.
Prevention of pedestrian injuries is difficult but should consist of a multifaceted approach. Education of the child in pedestrian safety should be initiated at an early age by the parents and continue into the school-­age years.
Younger children should be taught never to cross streets when alone; older
children should be taught (and practice how) to negotiate quiet streets with
little traffic. Major streets should not be crossed alone until the child is at
least 10 years of age and has been observed to follow safe practices.

98 Part I u The Field of Pediatrics
Legislation and police enforcement are important components of
any campaign to reduce pedestrian injuries. Right-­turn-­on-­red laws
increase the hazard to pedestrians. In many cities, few drivers stop for
pedestrians in crosswalks, a special hazard for young children. Engineering changes in roadway design are extremely important as passive
prevention measures. Most important are measures to slow the speed
of traffic and to route traffic away from schools and residential areas;
these efforts are endorsed by parents and can decrease the risk of injuries and death by 10–35%. Other modifications include networks of
one-­way streets, proper placement of transit or school bus stops, sidewalks in urban and suburban areas, striping in rural areas to delineate
the edge of the road, “road diets” to reduce lanes of traffic pedestrians must cross, and curb parking regulations. Comprehensive traffic
“calming” schemes using these strategies have been very successful in
reducing child pedestrian injuries in Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, and increasingly, the United States.

Falls

Falls are the leading cause of nonfatal injury in children and adolescents. Altogether, there were 1.8 million falls that led to ED visits in
2019 for children and adolescents; approximately 2.9% of these visits led to a hospitalization or transfer. There have been relatively few
in-­depth analytic studies of falls, except in particular circumstances,
such as playground injuries. Strategies to prevent falls depend on the
environmental circumstances and social context in which they occur.
Window falls have been successfully prevented with the use of devices
that prevent egress, and injuries from playground falls can be mitigated through the use of proper surfacing, such as woodchips or other
soft, energy-­absorbing materials. Alcohol may also contribute to falls
among teenagers, and these injuries can be reduced by general strategies to reduce teen alcohol use.

Firearm Injuries

Homicides are third only to motor vehicle crashes and suicide
among causes of death in teenagers >15 years old. In 2019, 2,023
adolescents aged 15-­19 years were homicide victims; Black teenagers
accounted for 64% of the total, making homicides the most common
cause of death among this group. Over 85% of homicides among teenage males involved firearms, mostly handguns.
In the United States, approximately 32% of adults reported owning a
gun in 2020, including 36% of adults who had children under 18 in the
household. Home ownership of guns increases the risk of adolescent
suicide 3-­to 10-­fold and the risk of adolescent homicide up to 4-­fold.
In homes with guns, the risk to the occupants is far greater than the
chance that the gun will be used against an intruder; for every death
occurring in self-­defense, there may be 1.3 unintentional deaths, 4.6
homicides, and 37 suicides.
Handguns account for approximately 30% of the firearms in use
today, yet they are involved in 80% of criminal and other firearm misuse. Of all firearms, handguns pose the greatest risk to children and
adolescents. Access to handguns by adolescents is surprisingly common and is not restricted to those involved in gang or criminal activity.
Stricter policies to reduce youth access to handguns, rather than all
firearms, would appear to be the most appropriate focus of efforts to
reduce shooting injuries in children and adolescents (Fig. 14.6).
Locking and unloading guns and storing ammunition locked in a
different location substantially reduce the risk of a suicide or unintentional firearm injury among youth by up to 73%. Because up to
30% of handgun-­owning households have at least one firearm stored
unsafely, one potential approach to reducing these injuries could focus
on improving household firearm storage practices where children
and youth reside or visit. The evidence regarding the effectiveness of
office-­based counseling to influence firearm storage practice is mixed;
the most effective programs are those in which safe storage devices are
dispensed along with advice.
Adolescents with mental health conditions and alcoholism are at
particularly high risk for firearm injury. In the absence of conclusive
evidence, physicians should continue to work with families to eliminate access to guns in these households.

Injuries to children and adolescents involving firearms occur in three
different situations: unintentional injury, suicide attempt, and assault.
The injury may be fatal or may result in permanent sequelae.
Firearm related deaths (all causes) for youths (1-19 years) in 2020
was ~5.62 per 100,000 population. The rate was 17.4 for Black youths,
compared to 3.4 for White youths. Firearm homicides represent 60%
of firearm-related deaths in youths. In 2020, firearm-related deaths
exceeded motor vehicle collisions as the leading cause of death for children and adolescents. Unintentional firearm injuries and deaths have
continued to decrease and accounted for 426 deaths to children 0-­18
years old in 2019, representing only a very small fraction of all firearm
injuries among children and adolescents. The majority of these deaths
occur to teens during hunting or recreational activities.
Suicide is the second most common cause of death from all causes
in both males and females aged 10-­19 years. During the 1950s to
1970, suicide rates for children and adolescents more than doubled;
firearm suicide rates peaked in 1994 and decreased by 59% from this
peak by 2010 before gradually increasing, paralleling increases in the
overall suicide rate. The difference in the rate of suicide death between
males and females is related to the differences in method used during
attempts. Females die less often in suicide attempts because they use
less lethal means (mainly drugs) and perhaps have a lower degree of
intent. The use of firearms in a suicidal act results in an approximately
90% case fatality rate.

Although the current rates of homicide are much lower than at their
peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the problem of violence and
assault remains large. The origins of adult and teen violence occur
during childhood. Almost all adults who commit violent acts have a
history of violent behavior during childhood or adolescence. Longitudinal studies following groups of individuals from birth have found
that aggression occurs early and that most children learn to control this
aggression in childhood. Children who later become violent adolescents and adults do not learn to control this aggressive behavior.
The most successful interventions for violence target young children
and their families. These include home visits by nurses and paraprofessionals beginning in the prenatal period and continuing for the first few
years of life to provide support and guidance to parents, especially parents without other resources. Enrollment in early childhood education
programs (e.g., Head Start) beginning at age 3 years has been shown to
be effective in improving school success, keeping children in school,
and decreasing the chance that the child will experience delinquency
in adolescence. School-­
based interventions, including curricula to
increase the social skills of children and improve the parenting skills of
caregivers, have long-­term effects on violence and risk-­taking behavior.
Early identification of behavior problems by primary care pediatricians
can best be accomplished through the routine use of formal screening tools. Interventions in adolescence, such as family therapy, multisystemic therapy, and therapeutic foster care, can decrease problem
behavior and a subsequent decline into delinquency and violence.

PSYCHOSOCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF INJURIES

Many children and their parents have substantial psychosocial sequelae
from trauma. Studies in adults indicate that 10–40% of hospitalized
injured patients will have posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD;
see Chapter 38). Among injured children involved in motor vehicle

crashes, 90% of families will have symptoms of acute stress disorder
after the crash, although the diagnosis of acute stress disorder is poorly
predictive of later PTSD. Standardized questionnaires that collect data
from the child, the parents, and the medical record at the time of initial injury can serve as useful screening tests for later development
of PTSD. Early mental health intervention, with close follow-­up, is
important for the treatment of PTSD and for minimizing its effect on
the child and family.

Impact of Violence
Exposure on Children
Marilyn C. Augustyn, Neena McConnico,
and Barry S. Zuckerman
The reach of violence—whether as the victim, perpetrator, or witness, whether in person or through the media—is far, deep, and long-­
standing across the globe. In the home, it is estimated that 80–95% of
children and youth witness such aggression. In general, the types of
violence children are exposed to increases in severity as children grow
older. Exposure to violence disrupts the healthy development of children in a myriad of ways. Pediatric clinicians must be aware of violence
exposure and competent to address its impact on children and families
under their care (trauma-­informed care). Trauma-­informed care gives

pediatric clinicians the tools to assess childhood trauma and adversity
experiences as well as practical guidance, resources, and interventions.
Clinicians also have a wider responsibility to advocate on local, state,
national, and international levels for safer environments in which all
children can grow and thrive (see Fig. 14.6).
We know that many traumatic events during childhood can have
immediate and long-­term impact (adverse childhood experiences; see
Chapter 1). Adversity in the first years of life may deleteriously affect
the course of human development throughout the life span, and witnessing violence is one such adversity. Because bystanders who witness violence can have permanent emotional and behavioral effects
due to neurophysiologic alterations, healthcare providers may not fully
appreciate their distress and thereby miss an opportunity to provide
needed interventions. For children not living in war zones, the source
of first exposure to violence is often intimate partner violence (IPV).
In the United States alone, >1 in 15 children witness IPV each year,
and worldwide approximately 275 million children are exposed to IPV
yearly. Exposure to IPV in infancy and toddlerhood affects attachment relationships, and school-­aged youth who witness IPV have difficulties in developing and maintaining friendships, have difficulty in
school, may abuse drugs and alcohol, and may develop mental health
problems.
Another source of witnessed violence is community violence, a
serious problem in the United States that disproportionately affects
children from low-­income areas. Approximately 22% of children witness violence in their family or in their community each year; witnessed violence includes assaults and bullying, sexual victimization,
maltreatment by a caregiver, and theft or vandalism. Almost 60% of
children will experience or witness violence during childhood. Witnessing acts of violence may be a significant stressor in children’s lives.
Witnessed community violence is related to internalizing problems
such as depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well
as externalizing problems, including delinquent behavior, aggression,
and substance abuse.
The most ubiquitous source of witnessing violence for U.S. children
is media violence, sometimes referred to as virtual violence. This form

of violence is not experienced physically; rather it is experienced in
realistic ways through technology and ever more intense and realistic games. There is an ever-­widening array of screens that are part of
children’s everyday lives, including computers, tablets, and cell phones,
in addition to long-­standing platforms, such as televisions and movies. Tragic events, including mass shootings and acts of terrorism,
have increased the specter of fear among children as these events are
reenacted for them on the multiple screens they encounter. Although
exposure to media/virtual violence cannot be equated to exposure to
real-­life violence, many studies confirm that media/virtual violence
desensitizes youth to the meaning and impact of violent behavior. Violent video game exposure may be associated with increased aggressive
behavior; increased aggressive cognitions; increased aggressive affect,
increased desensitization, and decreased empathy; and increased physiologic arousal. Violent video game use is a risk factor for adverse outcomes; however, insufficient data exist to examine any potential link
between violent video game use and delinquency or criminal behavior.
Table 15.1 lists interventions to reduce exposure to media violence.

IMPACTS OF VIOLENCE

All types of violence have a profound impact on health and development, physiologically, psychologically, and behaviorally potentially
leading to the challenges mentioned earlier. It may influence how children view the world and their place in it. Children can come to see the
world as a dangerous and unpredictable place. This fear may thwart
their exploration of the environment, which is essential to learning in
childhood. Youth may experience overwhelming terror, helplessness,
and fear, even if they are not immediately in danger. Young children are
most vulnerable to threats that involve the safety (or perceived safety)
Table 15.1  Public Health Recommendations to Reduce
Effects of Media Violence on Children and
Adolescents
1.	Parents should:

• Be made aware of the risks associated with children viewing violent
imagery, as it promotes aggressive attitudes, antisocial behavior, fear,
and desensitization.
• Review the nature, extent, and context of violence in media available to
their children before children view it.
• Assist children’s understanding of violent imagery appropriate to their
developmental level.
• Be aware and monitor social media access/use of youth

2.	Professionals should:

• Offer support and advice to parents who allow their children unsupervised
access to extreme violent imagery, as this could be seen as a form of
emotional abuse and neglect.
• Educate all young people in critical film appraisal in terms of realism,
justification, and consequences.
• Exercise greater control over access to inappropriate violent media
entertainment by young people in secure institutions.
• Use violent film material in anger management programs under
guidance.

3.	Media producers should:

• Reduce violent content and promote antiviolence themes and publicity
campaigns.
• Ensure that when violence is presented, it is in context and associated
with remorse, criticism, and penalty.
• Ensure that violent action is not justified or its consequences
understated.

4.	Policymakers should:

• Monitor the nature, extent, and context of violence in all forms of media
and implement appropriate guidelines, standards, and penalties.
• Ensure that education in media awareness is a priority and a part of
school curricula.

of their caretakers. Chronic exposure to violence predisposes children
to subsequent mental health problems and can have a deleterious effect
on learning and neurodevelopment. High exposure to violence in older
youth correlates with poorer performance in school, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and lower self-­esteem. Violence, particularly IPV,
can also teach youth especially powerful early lessons about the role
of violence in relationships. Violence may change the way that children view their future; they may believe that they could die at an early
age and thus take more risks, such as drinking alcohol, abusing drugs,
not wearing a seatbelt, and not taking prescribed medication. Violence
exposure is an important childhood adversity that is known to increase
the risk for poor health in adults.
Some children exposed to severe and/or chronic violence may suffer from PTSD, exhibiting constricted emotions, difficulty concentrating, autonomic disturbances, and reenactment of the trauma through
play or action (see Chapter 38). Based on the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-­5) criteria for PTSD in
children ≤6 years old, >50% of preschoolers may experience clinically
significant symptoms of PTSD after exposure to IPV. Although young
children may not fully meet these criteria, certain behavioral changes
are associated with exposure to trauma, such as sleep disturbances,
aggressive behavior, new fears, and increased anxiety about separations
(clinginess). A challenge in treating and diagnosing pediatric PTSD is
that a child’s caregiver exposed to the same trauma may be suffering
from it as well.

Diagnosis and Follow-­Up

The simplest way to recognize whether violence exposure has affected
a family is to screen both the caregivers and the youth (after approximately 8 years of age) on a regular basis. This practice is particularly
important during pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period,
when women may be at highest risk for being abused. It is important
to assure families that they are not being singled out, but that all families are asked about their exposure to violence. In the case of IPV, it is
important to ask the caregivers separately to maintain safety and mitigate risk for the caregiver who is being abused.
A direct approach may be useful: “Violence is a major problem in
our world today and one that impacts everyone in our society. So I ask
all my patients and families about violence that they experienced growing up as well as now. . . .” This can take the form of a three-­generation
family history of violence exposure. In other cases, beginning with general questions and then moving to the specific may be helpful: “Do you
feel safe in your home and neighborhood? Has anyone ever hurt you
or your child?” When violence has affected the child, it is important to
gather details about symptoms, behaviors, and protective factors that
support resilience.
The pediatric clinician can effectively counsel many parents and
children who have been exposed to violence. Regardless of the type of
violence to which the child has been exposed, the following components are part of the guidance: (1) careful review of the facts and details
of the event, (2) referring to support services, (3) providing information about the symptoms and behaviors common in youth exposed to
violence, (4) assistance in restoring a sense of stability to the family in
order to enhance the youth’s feelings of safety, and (5) helping caregivers talk to their children about the event. Families should be referred
to a mental health professional when (1) the violence is significant, (2)
symptoms are chronic (>6 months) or not improving, (3) if the violent
event involved the death or departure of a parent, (4) if the caregivers
are unable to empathize with the child, or (5) if the ongoing safety of
the child is a concern.

Chapter 15 u Impact of Violence Exposure on Children

15.1 Bullying, Cyberbullying, and School
Violence
Megan A. Moreno and Elizabeth Englander

BULLYING AND CYBERBULLYING

Bullying behavior affects people throughout the life span, but much
of the focus has been on children and adolescents. In the past, bullying was sometimes considered a rite of passage or was written off as
“kids being kids.” However, it is well recognized that bullying can have
profound short-­and long-­term negative consequences on all those
involved, including perpetrators, targets, and bystanders. The consequences of bullying can affect a child’s social experiences, academic
progress, and health.
Bullying is defined as any unwanted aggressive behavior by
another youth or group of youths that involves an actual or perceived
power imbalance and is repeated multiple times or is highly likely
to be repeated. Generally, sibling aggression and dating violence are
excluded, but research has associated these problems with peer bullying. Digital technology was initially viewed as a context in which
bullying can occur. Cyberbullying is not merely bullying that occurs
through electronic communications, but rather a type of bullying with
distinct elements, such as the potential for a single event to “go viral”
and the use of technology as a tool to achieve power imbalance.
It is thought that bullying and cyberbullying are more alike than dissimilar and that surveillance efforts, as well as prevention and intervention approaches, should address both types of bullying.

Bullying Roles and Nomenclature

Bullying represents a dynamic social interaction in which an individual
may play different roles at different stages. A child can be a perpetrator of bullying, a target of bullying, a witness or bystander, or simply a
child whose environment is affected by pervasive bullying. In any bullying experience, the roles that each child plays may be fluid, such that
a target of bullying may then become a perpetrator, or vice versa. Thus
common nomenclature has evolved to refer to children as perpetrators
of bullying or targets of bullying to represent a present state, rather than
labeling a child as a bully or a victim, which suggests a static role and
may affect that child’s self-­image.

Epidemiology

Bullying is a widespread problem during childhood and adolescence.
Current estimates suggest that school-­based bullying likely affects
18–31% of children and youth and that cyberbullying affects 7–15% of
youth. Apparent rates of bullying are influenced by the questions that
are asked; the word “bully” is stigmatized, and absent that label, youth
are more willing to acknowledge having engaged in activities that can
be categorized as bullying. Estimates of bullying prevalence are typically based on self-­reported victimization (not perpetration), but here
too, language can influence results. Targets of other types of social conflict may overestimate or underestimate their bullying victimization
unless precise language is used during assessment.

Risk Factors

Certain groups are more vulnerable to bullying, including youth who
are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ+);
immigrant and ethnic/racial minoritized youth; obese youth; and youth
with disabilities. However, it is important to recognize that although
these individual risk factors exist, the context and situation can also
present unique risk factors. Some studies have found that Black children are bullied more often than Latinos, whereas other studies have
found no group differences. Contextual factors, such as the school climate or prevalence of a particular ethnic group in a school setting, may
be important factors in a given bullying situation. The 2019 Youth Risk
Behavior Survey found that White teens were much more likely than
Black teens to report experiencing any bullying. Thus it is important to

101

recognize that any individual being bullied is embedded within a situation that is within a larger social context. This person by situation by
context approach is useful to consider in identifying why bullying takes
place in some situations but not others.
Bullying may occur with other high-­risk behaviors. Students who
carry weapons, smoke, and drink alcohol are at higher risk for engaging in bullying. Negative parenting behavior is related to a moderately
increased risk of becoming a bully/victim (youth who are both perpetrators and targets) and small to moderate effects on being targeted for
bullying at school.
Some risk factors may be specific to cyberbullying. Among preadolescent children, more access to technology (e.g., cell phone ownership) predicts cyberbullying behaviors and some types of digital
victimization. Also, communications through digital technology can
be misperceived as hostility, and those misperceptions can in turn
increase electronic forms of bullying.

Consequences of Bullying

Involvement in any type of bullying is associated with poorer psychosocial adjustment; perpetrators, targets, and those both perpetrator
and target report greater health problems and poorer emotional and
social adjustment. Consequences of both traditional and cyber forms
of bullying are particularly significant in the areas of physical health,
mental health, and academic achievement. Being the target of bullying
is typically viewed as particularly stressful. The impact of this stress
has been shown to affect the developing brain and to be associated
with changes to the stress response system, which confers an increased
risk for future health and academic difficulties. The long-­term consequences of being bullied as a child include increased risk for depression, poor self-­esteem, and abusive relationships. Negative outcomes
for perpetrating bullying include higher risks of depression and substance abuse. Mental health consequences for both perpetrator and
target include, across types of bullying, increased risks of depression,
poor self-­esteem, increased suicidality, and anxiety. Academic difficulties include increased risk of poor school performance, school failure,
and dropping out.

SCHOOL VIOLENCE
Epidemiology

School violence is a significant problem in the United States. Almost
40% of U.S. schools report a least one violent incident to police, with
>600,000 victims of violent crime per year. Among 9th to 12th graders, 8% were threatened or injured on school property in the last 12
months, and 14% were involved in a physical fight over the last year.
Still, school-­associated violent deaths are rare. Seventeen homicides
of children aged 5-­18 years occurred at school during the 2009–2010
school year. Of all youth homicides, <2% occur at school. Although
urban schools experience more episodes of violence, the rare rampage
gun violence that happens in rural and suburban schools demonstrates
that no region is immune to lethal violence.

Risk Factors

Bullying and weapon carrying may be important precursors to more
serious school violence. Among perpetrators of violent deaths at
school, 20% had been bullying victims, and 6% carried a weapon to
school in the last 30 days. Nonlethal violence, mental health problems,
racial tensions, student attacks on teachers, and the effects of rapid
economic change in communities can all lead to school violence. Individual risk factors for violence include prior history of violence, drug,
alcohol, or tobacco use, association with delinquent peers, poor family
functioning, poor grades in school, and poverty in the community.
Family risk factors include early childbearing, low parental attachment and involvement, authoritarian or permissive parenting styles
(see Chapter 20), and poverty. There is more school violence in areas
with higher crime rates and more street gangs, which take away students’ ability to learn in a safe environment and leave many children
with traumatic stress and grief reactions.

102 Part I u The Field of Pediatrics
TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF BULLYING AND
SCHOOL VIOLENCE

Pediatric providers are in a unique position to screen, treat, and advocate for reducing the impact of bullying and school violence by assisting those affected and seeking to prevent further occurrences.

Signs and Symptoms

Signs of a child being involved in bullying or exposed to school violence
include physical complaints such as insomnia, stomachaches, headaches,
and new-­onset enuresis. Psychologic symptoms, such as depression (see
Chapter 39), loneliness, anxiety (see Chapter 38), and suicidal ideation,
may occur. Behavioral changes, such as irritability, poor concentration,
school avoidance, and substance abuse, are common. School problems,
such as academic failure, social problems, and lack of friends, can also
occur. Additional vigilance is warranted for those children who represent vulnerable groups for bullying and aggression, including youth with
disabilities; obesity; or minority, immigrant, or LGBTQ+ status.

Screening for Bullying

Assessing bullying and cyberbullying involvement is an important part
of pediatric visits. Several tools can be helpful for clinicians, including the Bright Futures Guidelines, which recommend screening at each
well-­child visit. In these discussions, begin by normalizing the conversation; for example, practitioners can let the patient know that bullying
is a topic they discuss with all their patients. It is advisable to define
bullying based on the uniform definition but using readily understandable and developmentally appropriate language. Physicians can ask
patients if they have had experiences where there was repeated cruelty
or “mean actions” between peers, either as a target of that cruelty or
seeing the cruelty, or even being angry or mean toward others. Asking
a patient if he or she is a bully is not likely to generate either trust or an
honest answer. Asking about exposures to peer victimization or school
violence is also important. Throughout these discussions, it is critical to
provide support and empathy while engaging a patient.
One tool to help providers begin and navigate these discussions is a
Practice Enhancement Tool developed by the Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center (MARC) and Children’s Hospital Boston (Fig.
15.1). It begins by defining bullying in readily understandable language
and then asks, “Is there any one kid, or a bunch of kids, that pick on
you or make you feel bad over and over again?” The tool also guides
the practitioner in asking about problematic digital experiences and
asks whom the child has spoken to about the problem and whether
that has helped. Finally, it guides the practitioner through emphasizing
the usefulness of talking about social problems and discusses how the
physician can assist the patient.
Children who are aggressive, overly confident, lacking in empathy,
or have persistent conduct problems may need careful screening. It is
important to bear in mind that bullying is a dynamic process, and a
child may be involved as both a perpetrator and a target at different
time points. The physical, behavioral, psychologic, and academic symptoms of bullying may overlap with other conditions, such as medical
illness, learning problems, and psychologic disorders. Thus labeling the
behavior as bullying rather than the child as a “bully” is recommended.
Management of bullying and school violence involves several steps.
First, ensure that all parties understand the relevant information (the
patient, parents, and school). Second, assess a child’s need for specialized counseling or social skills interventions. Extracurricular activities
(e.g., drama clubs, mentoring programs, sports) can be discussed as
avenues to help increase the child’s social skills and self-­esteem. Third,
ensure that the patient has adequate support, including at home and at
school. Peers are a particularly effective source of support, and patients
can be encouraged to spend time with friends, but parents and educators are also important sources of emotional support. Many children
benefit from planning their actions in unstructured settings (e.g., discussing where they could sit during lunch), whereas some benefit from
role-­playing. Finally, the clinician should identify safety issues, such
as suicidal ideation and plans, substance abuse, and other high-­risk
behaviors.

When bullying or cyberbullying is suspected or confirmed, the parents
and child should be offered education and resources. Some resources
include the government-­supported website www.stopbullying.gov, as
well as MARC. Both provide free downloadable literature that can be
offered to parents and families.
Addressing cases of bullying or exposure to violence in clinic often
requires a cross-­disciplinary approach. Involving teachers or school
counselors, as well as outside referrals to psychologists, social workers,
or counselors, may be warranted. Parental mental health and resource
risk factors should also be addressed.

Prevention

Pediatric clinicians can reasonably expect their patients’ schools to provide violence and bullying prevention programs. Rather than focusing on only changing a target of bullying, successful interventions use
whole-­school approaches that involve multiple stakeholders. School
climate has been shown to have significant effects on bullying prevalence, so these approaches are essential to primary prevention. These
broad-­based programs simultaneously include school-­wide rules and
sanctions, teacher training, classroom curriculum, and high levels of
student engagement. Addressing access to firearms, involving community organizations and parents, and supporting youth mental health are
important in creating a safe school climate.
Prevention programs for cyberbullying are at a nascent stage, reflecting uncertainty about the prevalence of the practice, who is perpetrating
it and from where, and how students respond when they are victimized.
Many schools have established cyberbullying policies and are increasingly involved with teaching youth about guidelines for appropriate
online interactions and monitoring for cyberbullying problems. As of
2016, 23 states included cyberbullying in their state antibullying laws,
and 48 states included “electronic harassment.” Although legal remedies
are frequently not the most productive answer to bullying and cyberbullying incidents, pediatric clinicians should be aware of local laws and be
prepared to refer parents to more information about these laws when
necessary. Studies suggest that preventive interventions designed to
address bullying have effects on cyberbullying, and vice versa.
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) provides a free online
Family Media Use Plan that allows families to develop rules for digital
media use and prompts for discussions about safety and online relationships with the goal of preventing negative consequences of online behavior and interactions. The tool is designed for ongoing discussions with
family members about online experiences and family rules and values.

15.2 Media Violence
Megan A. Moreno
Today’s youth are growing up in a media-­rich environment of both
traditional and digital media. Traditional media includes television
(TV), radio, and periodicals; digital media includes online content that
promotes interactive and social engagement. The online world allows
youth instant access to entertainment, information, and knowledge;
social contact; and marketing. Social and interactive media allow users
to act as both creators and consumers of content. Examples include
applications (apps), social media, multiplayer video games, YouTube
videos, and video blogs (vlogs).
One of the earliest studies that has been linked to media effects
on aggression and violence was the “bobo doll” experiment in which
children who observed an aggressive adult model were more likely
to be aggressive toward a doll afterward. It has been widely accepted
that media exposure can affect behavior; the advertising industry
is grounded in the concept that media exposure can change purchasing behavior. Exposure to sexual content in media has been
linked to earlier sexual initiation; exposure to pro-­alcohol content

has been linked to earlier alcohol initiation. However, applying
these same constructs to media violence has been controversial.
Some suggest that other concepts may be important to consider,
such as “dose-­
response” effects of media or gene-­
environment
interactions.
There are three main types of media in which children may be
exposed to violence: video games, traditional media, and social
media. Violent video game exposure is associated with several
outcomes, including increases in composite aggression score,
aggressive behavior, aggressive cognitions, aggressive affect, and
desensitization; decreased empathy; and increased physiologic
arousal. Several mechanisms for these outcomes have been studied.
These have included evaluating links between video game violence
and the limbic or reward areas of the brain, as well as through other
cognitive processes, including skill acquisition, cognitive control,
and attention.
Traditional media such as movies and TV often model violent
behavior for the purposes of entertainment. Media violence does not
always portray the real human cost or suffering caused by violence.
Special effects can make virtual violence more believable and appealing than in the real world. For some children, exposure to media violence can lead to anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, or
sleep disorders and nightmares. Repeated exposure to the behavioral
scripts provided by entertainment media can lead to increased feelings
of hostility, expectations for aggression, desensitization to violence,
and increased likelihood of interacting and responding to others with
violence.
Social media presents similar risks of exposure to virtual violence,
but because of the interactive nature of the medium, this content can
feel more personal, relevant, or targeted. Social media combines peer
and media effects and thereby represents a powerful motivator of
behavior, whether content created by adolescents themselves or content they find and share with peers. The Facebook Influence Model
describes 13 distinct constructs in which social media may influence
users, such as establishing social norms and connection to identity.
Thus exposure to violent content on social media may have an influence in promoting a social norm or connecting this type of content to
one’s own identity.

SCREENING

It is important for pediatricians to screen and counsel patients and
families about media use and exposure to violent content. Both the
quantity and the quality of media are critical factors in media effects
on children. When heavy media use by a child is identified, pediatricians should evaluate the child for aggressive behaviors, fears, or sleep
disturbances and intervene appropriately.

RECOMMENDATIONS (SEE TABLE 15.1)

Pediatricians can counsel parents to help their children avoid
exposure to any form of media violence under age 8 years. These
younger children do not have the capacity to distinguish fantasy
from reality.
Parents should select and co-­view media with their children,
including playing video games with them, watching movies together,
and co-­viewing social media content. Parents can then assess these
games and shows in regard to what they are teaching about communication and interactions with others.
Parents should feel empowered to place restrictions on games or
shows that reward shooting, killing, or harming other people. Media
are powerful teachers, and parents can make choices about how much
violence they want their children to learn. Parents can use industry
ratings, such as from the Motion Picture Association of America and
the Entertainment Software Ratings Board for movies and TV, as well
as resources such as Commonsense Media (which also includes video
game reviews), to guide media selections.

15.3 Effects of War on Children
Isaiah D. Wexler and Eitan Kerem
The adverse consequences of war on children are devastating and
long-­
lasting—death, injury, loss of family members, conflict-­
associated sexual violence, food insecurity, forced relocation
(prejudice and discrimination in the receiving country), coercive
conscription, child abduction, and psychologic trauma. Human
rights organizations and the Secretary General of the United Nations
annually detail the extent and impact of war on children. These
reports clearly establish that war is a global phenomenon associated with a staggering intensity of human rights violations involving children. Approximately 426 million live in a conflict zone, and
∼1.6 billion children (0-­18 years) live in a conflict-­affected country
(Fig. 15.2). The recent onset of large-scale hostilities between Russia and Ukraine in 2022 has had a significant impact on children,
especially displacement.
During the last decade, there has been an increase in armed conflict–
associated exploitation in the form of human trafficking, slavery, forced
marriages, prostitution, and child labor. Displacement and forced relocation are on the rise as a result of the increasing number of intrastate conflicts, especially in the Middle East and Africa. In 2020, UNHCR (Office
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) reported the

astounding statistic of 82.4 million people forcibly displaced worldwide,
with most of the refugees being sheltered in developing countries that
lack adequate resources to deal with large-­scale humanitarian crises. In
Ukraine, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported that 2 million children had been internally displaced
at the end of 2022. Reemergence of polio or cholera and the increased
virulence of tuberculosis have been associated with conflict-­affected
regions and large population displacements. The COVID-­19 pandemic
that began in 2020 has worsened the existing situation, with widespread
disruption of health and educational services provided by domestic
healthcare systems and humanitarian organizations.
Mortality and morbidity related to the long-­term effects of war and
civil strife are as significant as those occurring during actual fighting. War
and violence are rarely listed as leading causes of childhood mortality, but
the regions with the highest levels of child mortality, especially among
children <5 years of age, are the same locations involved in military conflicts. Nations experiencing conflict often devote substantial portions of
their budgets to military expenditures at the expense of the healthcare
infrastructure; a substantial proportion of deaths attributed to malnutrition, environmentally related infectious disease, or inadequate immunization are related to the effects of war. Children experiencing the trauma
of wartime violence are at risk for long-­term health sequelae, with greater
risk for obesity, hypertension, stroke, and cardiovascular disease.
During wartime, customary patterns of behavior are forced to
change, overcrowding is frequent, and essential resources, such as
water and food staples, may be polluted or contaminated. There is a
growing understanding that war and climate change are linked. Armed
conflict can worsen the impact of spreading desertification, and competition for scarce resources can serve as a stimulus for war.
The morbidity of children exposed to conflicts is significant and
long-­term (Table 15.2). Many more children are physically harmed
than killed. Children bear the psychologic scars of war resulting
from exposure to violent events, loss of primary caregivers, and
forced removal from their homes. Impressment of children into service as soldiers is a form of exploitation associated with long-­term
problems of adjustment. Child soldiers often lack the appropriate
education and socialization, and thus their moral compass is often
misaligned. They are often incapable of understanding the sources
of conflict or why they have been targeted. Their thought processes
are more concrete; it is easier for them to dehumanize their adversaries. Children, who themselves are exposed to violence and cruelty, frequently become the worst perpetrators of atrocities.
After cessation of hostilities, children are still at risk for life-­
endangering injuries from landmines, unexploded ordinance, and
other explosive remnants of war. Before the signing of the international treaty to ban landmines in 1997, an estimated 20,000-­
25,000 casualties occurred annually from landmines. Despite the
ban, there are still a significant amount of casualties reported, with
over 7,000 casualties in 2020 according to Landmine and Cluster
Munition Monitor, a nongovernmental organization monitoring
adherence to the international treaty. Approximately 30% of these
casualties occur in children, with a predominance of males. The
continued proliferation of small arms and light weapons, which are
easily handled by children, also continues to take its toll on human
life and hinders stabilization in post ­conflict societies.

SUSCEPTIBILITY OF CHILDREN IN TIMES OF WAR

Children do not have the physical or intellectual capabilities to
defend themselves. It is easier for adults to victimize children than
other adults. Older children’s curiosity, desire for adventure, and
imperfect assessment of risk often lead them to participate in dangerous behavior. Younger children, because of their small size and
immature physiology, are more susceptible to disease and starvation
and are more likely to sustain fatal injuries from ballistic projectiles
and explosive devices such as mines. Blast injuries, a common cause
of violence-­related injuries, have a more devastating impact on children than on adults. Specific types of military engagement can have

a disproportionate effect on children. In a survey of war-­related mortality in Iraq from 2003 to 2008, it was found that approximately 10%
of the violence-­related fatalities were children. Most children succumbed to either small arms gunfire or suicide bombs (35%). Data
collected during the Syrian civil war from 2011 to 2016 showed that
17% of the approximately 100,000 fatal civilian casualties were children, with over 70% of male children succumbing as a result of artillery shelling or aerial bombardments.
During times of war, there is a breakdown of social inhibitions
and cultural norms. Exploitation of children, such as forced marriages or involuntary conscription, are rationalized as being beneficial for the greater cause. Aberrant behavior such as rape, torture,
and pillaging, which would be inconceivable in times of peace, is
common during war. Children may be attacked, kidnapped, or used
as human shields.
The changing nature of war has adversely affected children.
Conventional warfare in which armies of professional soldiers
representing different countries battle each other has become less
common since World War II, with the notable exception of the
Russia-Ukraine war Intrastate conflicts in the form of civil war or
insurgency predominate. In 2020, there were over 50 active intrastate armed conflicts in the world, as documented by the Uppsala
Conflict Data Program (UCDP). These conflicts are often rooted
in factious ethnic, political, or religious ideologies, and the participants are frequently nonprofessional irregulars who lack discipline
and accountability to higher echelons and are directed by those who
do not acknowledge or respect international accords governing warfare. Often the military resources of the antagonists are disproportionate, leading the weaker protagonist to develop compensatory

108 Part I u The Field of Pediatrics
tactics that can include guerrilla, paramilitary, and terrorist activities, while the stronger side often resorts to the disproportionate
use of force. Low-­intensity conflicts have become more common.
These types of conflicts are often characterized by military activities
targeting civilian populations with the goal of disrupting normal
routines and generating publicity for the perpetrators. Sites of violence can be remote from the battleground when one or both parties
to a conflict resort to terrorist activities.
Terrorism and organized urban-­based gang warfare have become
prevalent. Violence perpetrated by terrorist groups or gangs is
designed to coerce and intimidate both individuals and entire societies. Children are often intended victims of political-­or religious-­
motivated violence because this serves to maximize the impact of
terrorism. The destruction of the New York City World Trade Center Towers in 2001 and the nearly 3,000 fatalities showed that highly
organized and motivated terrorists have few inhibitions and can
strike anywhere. Biologic and chemical weapons of mass destruction have been employed, with the most recent example being the
use of poisonous gases in the Syrian civil war. Children are more
susceptible to chemical and biologic toxins because of their higher
respiratory rates, more permeable skin, and other developmental
vulnerabilities (see Chapter 763).
The media and the internet have had a significant role in exacerbating the effects of war on children. Media coverage of war and
terrorist events is extensive and visual, and social media promulgated via the internet is a convenient tool for disseminating propaganda and graphic video material designed to recruit volunteers
and shock opponents. Children, more impressionable than adults,
often view this material uncontrolled. Uncensored pictures of
victims, unbridled violence, people in shock, or family members
searching through ruins for relatives may traumatize children and
even encourage inappropriate behavior. Overt broadcast propaganda glorifying war and violence may sway children to participate
in militaristic or antisocial activities (see Chapter 15.2).

PSYCHOLOGIC IMPACT OF WAR

Exposure to war and violence can have a significant impact on a
child’s psychosocial development. Displacement, loss of caregivers,
physical suffering, and the lack of appropriate socialization all contribute to abnormal child development. Often the reactions are age
specific (Table 15.3). Preschoolers may have an increase in somatic
complaints and sleep disturbances and display acting-­out behaviors such as tantrums or excessively clinging behavior. School-­aged
children may show regressive behavior such as enuresis and thumb
sucking. They, too, have an increase in somatic complaints; there
is often a negative impact on school performance. For teenagers,
psychologic withdrawal and depression are common. Adolescents
often exhibit trauma-­stimulated acting-­out behavior. Motivated by
the desire for revenge, they may be quick to join in the violence and
contribute to the continuation of conflict.
There is an increased incidence of both acute stress reactions
and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; see Chapter 38). The
true incidence is difficult to assess because of the heterogeneous
nature of war, degree of exposure to violence, and methodologic
challenges related to the precise characterization of PTSD. Risk
factors for having a more serious psychologic response to a violent
event include severity of the incident, personal involvement (physical injury, proximity, loss of a relative), prior history of exposure
to traumatic events, female gender, and a dysfunctional parental
response to the same event. Children may develop PTSD many
years after the traumatic event. Children do not have to be directly
exposed to violent activity, and media coverage of terrorist events
may be sufficient to trigger PTSD-­like symptomatology.
The trauma experienced by children during war can have lifelong
effects. Studies on children imprisoned in concentration camps or
evacuated from their homes in London during the Battle of Britain
show that these individuals were at greater risk for PTSD, anxiety

disorders, and a higher level of dissatisfaction with life when surveyed decades after the traumatic events. Depression is often a
comorbid condition associated with PTSD among children exposed
to armed conflict. Trauma may have a transgenerational effect,
with biologic stress responses and environmental influences causing children of PTSD victims to display a wide variety of psychologic disorders. On the positive side, children are more resilient
than adults. With appropriate support from family and community,
together with timely and intensive psychologic intervention, children can recover and lead normal, productive lives despite the searing trauma that they may have experienced.

EFFORTS TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM THE
EFFECTS OF WAR
International Conventions

War and terror violate the human rights of children, including the
right to life, the right to be nurtured and protected, the right to
develop appropriately, the right to be with family and community,
and the right to a healthy existence. Several international treaties and
conventions have been ratified, beginning with the Fourth Geneva
Convention (1949) that set forth guidelines regarding appropriate
treatment of children in times of war. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1990) delineated specific human
rights inherent to every child (defined as any individual younger
than 18 years) and the subsequent First Optional Protocol (2000),
which prohibits conscripting or recruiting children for military
activities. The Third Optional Protocol in 2014 established methods for communicating complaints of human rights violations
involving children to the United Nations Committee on the Rights
of the Child and sets up procedures by which the committee can

Chapter 15 u Impact of Violence Exposure on Children
conduct inquiries into alleged human rights violations among signatory nations. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal
Court enacted in 2002 declared that the conscription or enlistment of children younger than 15 years is a prosecutable war crime.
Despite these conventions and better documentation, human rights
violations have not abated. In the past decade there has even been
an upswing in the recruitment of child soldiers as combatants by
nonstate armed groups (NSAGs).
Although these treaties and conventions define the extent of
protection afforded to children, the means of enforcement available to the international community is limited. Individuals, motivated by religious fervor, nationalistic zeal, or ethnic xenophobia,
are unlikely to curb their activities because of fear of prosecution. These treaties better serve in heightening awareness regarding the protected status of children in wartime, and perhaps deter
high-­
ranking leaders who fear being held accountable for war
crimes.

Humanitarian Efforts

Several organizations, either nongovernmental or under UN auspices, are involved in mitigating the effects of war on children. The
International Red Cross, UNICEF, UNHCR, International Rescue
Committee, World Health Organization (WHO), and Médicins Sans
Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) have had a significant impact
on reducing violence-­related casualties in war-­torn regions. During
the Russia-Ukraine war, many countries sent medical teams including
pediatricians to Ukraine and neighboring countries hosting refugees to
provide assistance. The infusion of humanitarian aid into developing
countries often improves overall mortality and morbidity by increasing
the level of medical and social services available to the general population. Other organizations, such as Amnesty International, Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute, and Physicians for Human
Rights, actively monitor human rights abuses involving children and
other civilian groups. In 2005 the UN Security Council approved the
establishment of a monitoring and reporting system designed to protect children exposed to war. UN-­led task forces conduct active surveillance in war-­stricken regions reporting on the six grave violations
against children during armed conflict: the killing or injuring of children, recruitment of child soldiers, attacks directed against schools or
hospitals, sexual violence against children, abduction of children, and
denial of humanitarian access for children.

ROLE OF PEDIATRICIANS AND ALLIED HEALTH
PROFESSIONALS

War is a chronic condition, and health providers need to be prepared
to treat childhood casualties resulting from military or terrorist activity, as well as caring for children suffering from the aftermath of war
or related violence. Community and hospital pediatricians need to be
involved in community disaster planning. General disaster planning
should not ignore the unique needs and requirements of children;
in planning for a possible chemical attack, appropriate resuscitation
equipment suitable for children needs to be stockpiled. The signs of
biologic infection, chemical intoxication, or radiation injury are different for children, and pediatricians and emergency personnel need
to be aware of these differences (see Chapters 758 and 763). Surveys
of pediatricians and other healthcare providers indicate that many
feel unprepared for bioterrorism attacks. Professional organizations
(e.g., WHO, American Academy of Pediatricians [AAP], Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]) have published position papers, and the AAP Red Book presents guidelines for treating
specific pathogens likely to be used in biologic warfare. In regions

109

where violent terrorist activity is likely, pediatricians, nurses, and
rescue personnel should obtain certification provided by Red Cross
Basic and Advanced Trauma Life Support programs. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sponsors a Technical Resources,
Assistance Center, and Information Exchange (TRACIE) website that
includes information for health service providers related to disaster management and preparedness for incidents involving children
(asprtracie.hhs.gov).
Pediatricians need to be aware of the potential effects of war and
terror on parents and children. Loss or separation from parents or caregivers has a devastating impact on children (see Chapter 30). Parents,
who themselves are under tremendous strain, may not be sensitive to
the effects that the same stressors have on their children. Parents and
caregivers must be made cognizant of the effect that media coverage
can have on their children and their role in the intermediation of the
repetitive broadcast of real-­time acts of violence and incendiary communications designed to enlist support for specific causes. Pediatricians should draw out both parents and children and encourage them
to talk freely about their feelings. Child healthcare providers can be
instrumental in educating parents to be more aware of inappropriate
responses by children to war and violence. When necessary, pediatricians can serve their families by referring them to appropriate support
services.
Just as it is important to administer first aid for physical trauma, it
is also critical to provide psychologic first aid to victims of trauma.
An excellent source of online information for both providers and
caregivers is the U.S. government–sponsored National Child
Traumatic Stress Network (nctsn.org). In day-­to-­day patient interactions, a pediatrician is most likely to confront situations related
to stress reactions such as PTSD or depressive disorders. Recognition of PTSD is essential so that early treatment can be initiated.
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth
Edition (DSM-­5) stipulates that for a diagnosis of PTSD, there has
to be manifestations from each of four symptom clusters: intrusion,
avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, and alterations in arousal and reactivity. DSM-­5 also established a special preschool subtype of PTSD that has the same four symptom clusters
but with specific manifestations typical of preschoolers exposed
to trauma. Clues to the presence of PTSD and acute anxiety reactions include changes in behavior, school performance, affect, and
sleep patterns and an increase in somatic complaints. Even when
the triggering event is neither temporally nor physically proximate,
it should not dissuade the pediatrician from making an appropriate
referral to mental health professionals who are expert in childhood
stress disorders.
Medical professional standards demand that the physician treat
all patients equitably without regard to their background. Both
international law and professional medical societies ban physicians from actively participating in torture or other activities that
infringe on human rights, including those of children. It is difficult to countenance any situation in which a health professional,
even acting as a representative of their country, might directly or
indirectly injure a minor. On the positive side, many pediatricians
and other physicians have treated children during war either as
members of the armed services or volunteers, often under adverse
conditions, refusing to abandon their patients even when it has put
their own lives at risk. Pediatricians and pediatric organizations
have been at the forefront in advocating for peaceful coexistence,
assisting in relief efforts, and attempting to alleviate the disparities
in healthcare resulting from war.

Chapter 16

Child Trafficking for Sex
and Labor
V. Jordan Greenbaum
Human trafficking violates the fundamental human rights of
affected children, adolescents, and adults and affects families, communities, and societies. Trafficked persons originate from countries
worldwide and may belong to any racial, ethnic, religious, socioeconomic, or cultural group. They may be of any gender. According to the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish
Trafficking in Persons, child trafficking refers to the “recruitment,
transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of a person” under
18 years old for purposes of exploitation. Two major types of trafficking involve forced labor and sexual exploitation (Table 16.1).
Whereas adult sex trafficking requires demonstration of force,
fraud, coercion, deception, or the abuse of power as a means of
exploitation, these are not required for persons younger than 18
years. Interpretation of the international protocol varies across the
globe; U.S. law does not require movement of a victim to qualify
as human trafficking. In addition, minors who “consent” to commercial sex in the absence of a third party (trafficker) are victims
of commercial sexual exploitation, because their age precludes true
informed consent.
Child trafficking may occur within the confines of the child’s home
country (domestic trafficking) or may cross national borders (international, or transnational, trafficking). Globally, individuals tend to be
trafficked within their own country or to a country in the same region.
In the United States, most identified children and adolescents experiencing sex trafficking are U.S. citizens or legal residents; few statistical
data exist on minors who are trafficked for labor. Variations in definitions of terms, problems with data collection, and underrecognition of
affected individuals complicate estimates of the prevalence of human
trafficking, but the International Labour Organization estimates that

approximately 3.3 million children and adolescents across the globe
experienced forced labor in 2021, of whom approximately 1.7 million
were subjected to commercial sexual exploitation. In a global study of
officially identified trafficked persons, the United Nations Office on
Drugs and Crime estimated that approximately 19% were girls and
15% boys. However, laws that define sexual exploitation in terms of
females and women, as well as cultural views regarding gender roles,
lead to underreporting of males, especially as victims of sex trafficking,
so their numbers may be higher than estimated.
Factors creating vulnerability to human trafficking exist at the
individual, relationship, community, and societal levels (Table 16.2).
Age is an important risk factor for adolescents because they are at a
stage in their development at which they have limited life experience,
a desire to demonstrate their independence from parental control,
and a level of brain maturation that favors risk-­taking and impulsive behaviors over careful situational analysis and other executive
functions. They are also very interested in social media and are savvy
at internet use, which render them susceptible to online recruitment
and solicitation.
Recruitment of children and adolescents for labor or sex trafficking
often involves false promises of romance, job opportunities, or a better
life. Individuals may remain in their exploitative situation for a number of reasons, including fear of violence to themselves or their loved
ones should they attempt to leave their situation; guilt and shame for
believing the fraudulent recruitment scheme or engaging in illegal and/
or socially condemned activities; humiliation and fear of criticism by
authorities; debt bondage (believing they owe the trafficker exorbitant
amounts of money and cannot leave until the debt is paid); and fear of
arrest and/or deportation. Many children and adolescents do not view
their situation as exploitative. Females who believe their trafficker is a
boyfriend may view their commercial sexual activities as demonstrations of their love; males engaging in commercial sex to obtain shelter
or food while living on the street may feel they are exploiting buyers
rather than being victimized themselves. Traffickers may use violence,
economic manipulation, and psychologic manipulation to control
individuals.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION

Children and adolescents who experience trafficking may seek
medical care for any of the myriad physical and emotional conditions associated with exploitation. They may present with traumatic
injuries inflicted by traffickers, buyers, or others or injuries related
to unsafe working conditions. They may present with a history of
sexual assault or symptoms/signs of sexually transmitted infections
(STIs) and infections related to overcrowded, unsanitary conditions.
They may request testing for HIV or complain of signs/symptoms
of HIV or infections endemic to their home country (e.g., malaria,
schistosomiasis, tuberculosis). Other clinical presentations may
involve pregnancy and complications of pregnancy or abortion;
malnutrition and/or dehydration; exhaustion; conditions related to
exposure to toxins, chemicals, and dust; and signs and symptoms
of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depression, suicidality, behavioral problems including aggression, and somatization.
Some children and adolescents may have preexisting chronic medical conditions that have been inadequately treated before or during
the exploitation (e.g., diabetes, seizure disorder, asthma). Individuals who are trafficked may also seek medical care for their children.
Many of the same factors that prevent children and adolescents from
leaving their exploitative conditions also preclude them from disclosing
their situation to others. Most affected individuals presenting for medical
care at clinics, hospitals, and emergency departments do not spontaneously self-­identify as trafficked persons. Consequently, it is incumbent
on the medical professional to be aware of risk factors so that those being
trafficked and those at risk may be recognized and offered services. A
trafficked individual may present to a medical facility alone, in the company of a parent/guardian (who may or may not be aware of the trafficking situation), a friend or other person not involved in the trafficking, a
person working for the trafficker (who may pose as a friend or relative),

or the trafficker. Traffickers may be male or female, adult or juvenile, and
they may be family members, acquaintances, friends, or strangers. On
occasion, children and adolescents are brought in by law enforcement
or child protective services because of concerns of trafficking. Table 16.3
lists potential “red flags” for labor or sex trafficking. In some cases, the
red flag may be the chief complaint, which may involve a condition frequently associated with trafficking (e.g., STI symptoms/signs, especially
with history of prior STI, and a preventable work-­related injury such as a
toxic exposure). The practitioner may become concerned about possible
trafficking on recognizing the presence of one or more risk factors (e.g.,
runaway status, recent migration and current work in a sector known for
labor trafficking).

APPROACH TO THE PATIENT AT RISK FOR
TRAFFICKING

When interacting with a patient who may have experienced labor or sex
trafficking, the medical provider should use a trauma-­informed, human
rights–based, culturally appropriate, and gender-­sensitive approach
(Table 16.4). This involves an awareness that trauma experienced by a
young person may influence the child’s thoughts about themselves and
others, their beliefs and perceptions of the world, and their behavior.

Hostility, withdrawal, or distrust may be reactions to trauma and should
be met with a sensitive, nonjudgmental, empathic response by the provider. Physical safety of the patient and staff are critical, and protocols
should be in place to address security issues that may arise if the trafficker
is on the premises. Psychologic safety of the patient may be facilitated
by separating them from any accompanying person when obtaining the
medical history, conducting the visit in a warm, child-­friendly environment, and taking adequate time to build rapport and begin to establish
trust. When interpretation is needed, a professional interpreter should
be used. This person needs to be trained in trauma-­informed care and
should not be from the same community as the patient. When possible,
the patient’s preference for gender of clinician and interpreter should be
respected.
Respect for the patient’s rights is essential, including the right to
an explanation regarding the purpose of the questions being asked
and the reasons for, and elements of, the examination and diagnostic
evaluation. Informed assent by the patient for all steps of the process
should be obtained whenever possible. Every attempt should be made
to understand and respect cultural, gender-­based, and religious factors
that may affect the individual’s views of their bodies, their condition,
and their desired treatment.
The limits of confidentiality should be explained in a way the patient
understands so that they are able to choose what information to disclose. This should occur before asking sensitive questions. As appropriate to developmental stage and the context of the visit, the provider
should discuss how sensitive information is to be documented in the
individual’s medical record and work collaboratively to honor the
patient’s preferences and desire for privacy and confidentiality (within
the bounds of laws, policies, and the need to ensure appropriate continuity of care).
Currently, there are limited child trafficking screening tools
designed for the healthcare setting. The Short Screen for Child Sex
Trafficking (SSCST) is validated for youth 11-­17 years who present to emergency departments, child abuse clinics, and teen clinics;
this tool screens for risk factors associated with sex trafficking; a
positive screen indicates a child is at risk, and additional follow-­up
questions are needed to assess the level of risk and to determine
next steps (e.g., specific service referrals, mandatory reporting). It
does not screen for labor trafficking. The Quick Youth Indicators
of Trafficking (QYIT) is a short screen designed for young adults

Best interest of the child to be primary concern in all actions

Protection from discrimination because of gender, race, ethnicity,
culture, socioeconomic status, disability, religion, language,

All elements of the medical history and review of systems are
important, but special attention should be paid to reproductive history (including sexual orientation and gender identity, prior history
of sex partners, STIs, pregnancy and terminations, and condom use);
injury history; substance use/misuse; and mental health history and
current symptoms. Rates of substance misuse, PTSD, depression, and
suicidality are very high among individuals experiencing human trafficking, and questioning may highlight the need for emergency care
or nonurgent referrals. It also provides an opportunity for anticipatory
guidance aimed at harm reduction: a discussion of condom use, STIs,
HIV/AIDS, and substance use may prove invaluable, because many
youth lack accurate information on these topics. It is important to
identify any chronic conditions, especially if untreated, and to assess
vaccination status. Many individuals who have experienced trafficking have had very poor healthcare in the past and lack basic primary
care. It is important to ask questions about signs/symptoms of infections endemic to the child’s home country or to countries in which
the child has been trafficked (e.g., tuberculosis, dengue, malaria; see
Chapter 11).

Obtain medical history in a private, safe place, outside the presence
of persons accompanying the patient to the visit.
Explain all processes in way the patient understands, and obtain
assent for each step; discuss the limits of confidentiality and
mandated reporting.
Encourage the patient to express views and to participate in
decision-­making regarding referrals and care.
Foster the patient’s sense of control during the evaluation.
Ask only the questions needed to assess safety, health, and
well-­being. Avoid asking irrelevant questions about trauma to
avoid unnecessarily triggering anxiety and distress.
Minimize retraumatization during history, examination, and
diagnostic testing (avoid triggers of stress when possible).
Monitor for signs of distress, both verbal and nonverbal.
Allow the patient to choose the gender of the provider, if feasible.
Have trained personnel present during the examination to assist with

(18-­25) seeking services at a homeless shelter; it screens for both
labor and sex trafficking.
When a provider is speaking with a child at perceived risk for trafficking, additional questions may be asked once trust has been established.
These should be asked using a trauma-­informed approach. For example,
• “Many children who are living on the street have a hard time getting
money for food and shelter. Sometimes they have to exchange sex
to get what they need. Has this ever happened to you or anyone you
know?”
• When asking about sexual history: “Has anyone ever asked you or
forced you to have sex with another person? Do you feel comfortable
telling me about it?”
• “If you feel comfortable, can you tell me a little bit about your
job? Is the work you do what you expected when you agreed to
the job? Are you allowed to keep all of the money you earn or
send it home? Where, and with whom, do you live? When you are
not working, are you allowed to come and go from the place you
stay?”
Such questions may open the door to a discussion of exploitation and
facilitate the provider identifying appropriate resources and referrals.

A thorough physical examination allows the provider to assess and
treat acute and chronic medical conditions, collect forensic evidence
(as appropriate), assess nutritional and developmental status, and
document recent and remote injuries. Diagnostic testing may identify
pregnancy, STIs, HIV seroconversion, nonsexually transmitted infections, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, anemia, toxic exposures, and
drug or alcohol use. A sexual assault evidence kit may reveal trace evidence or DNA from offenders. Informed assent for the exam, assault
kit, and diagnostic tests is important, as is careful explanation of each
step during the process and monitoring of the patient for signs of distress and anxiety. Those who have been sex-­trafficked may experience
particular distress during the anogenital examination, the oral exam,
and when injuries are photographed. A trauma-­trained chaperone
is very helpful in providing comfort and support to the patient. The
examination should be conducted outside the presence of anyone suspected of being involved in the trafficking situation. After the exam
the provider should explain the results, ask the patient if they have any
questions about the exam, and give them the opportunity to discuss
concerns about their bodies. Individuals who experience trafficking
may harbor anxiety about a variety of issues, including possible infertility, future health, or possible permanent damage from work-­related
injuries and toxic conditions.
Providers may follow U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines on STI testing and prophylaxis. Additional
resources on laboratory testing for sexually and nonsexually transmitted diseases may be obtained from the CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/)
or World Health Organization (WHO) websites (http://www.who.in
t/en/). In general, STIs of greatest relevance include Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, HIV, syphilis,
and hepatitis B and C viruses. Methods of testing and decisions to treat
(e.g., positive test results vs prophylaxis vs syndromic treatment) will
depend on national guidelines and on medical resources, which may be
limited in some countries or regions. However, consideration should
be given to the high likelihood that the patient may be lost to follow-­up
after the visit, so the decision to delay treatment until test results are
available may lead to lack of needed medication. Testing and treatment
decisions need to be outlined in a protocol. Emergency contraception
and other methods of birth control (especially long-­acting reversible
contraception) should be discussed with the patient as feasible.
Many individuals who have been trafficked (and children of trafficked
adults) have experienced nutritional deprivation, lack of immunizations, and general poor health, especially if they are from low-­resource
countries or are born into the trafficking situation. Guidance on medical
screening and care for immigrant children (see Chapter 11) also may be
obtained from the CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/
guidelines/refugee-guidelines.html) or American Academy of Pediatrics

(AAP) Red Book or Immigrant Child Health Toolkit (https://aapca1.org/
resource/aap-immigrant-child-health-toolkit/). Consideration should be
given to vaccine-­preventable diseases (including tetanus if there are open
wounds) and common diseases in the patient’s home country. Trafficked
individuals may have iron deficiency, hemoglobinopathies, vitamin
D deficiency, and undiagnosed vision or hearing problems. Crowded,
unhygienic living conditions during the trafficking period raise the risks
of tuberculosis, scabies, and diarrheal illnesses. Toxic levels of lead or
chemicals may be present, and vitamin/mineral deficiencies should be
considered. A developmental or educational assessment is important,
given the high likelihood of poor primary care in the past and possible
harsh living conditions.
Documentation of overall health and identified injuries is extremely
important and should be detailed and accurate. Body diagrams and
photographs (if not traumatizing to the patient) are helpful, as are
written descriptions of injury location, type (e.g., contusion, laceration), size, shape, and color. All photographs should include patient
identifiers and a measuring instrument when possible. Distance photographs to establish injury location may be supplemented with close-­up
photographs from various angles. Physical signs of untreated illness,
malnutrition, and other conditions need to be documented carefully.
When documenting the medical history, direct quotes should be used
when possible (quotes of provider and of patient statements). Records,
including written, video, audio, and photographic records, should be
stored in a secure health information system, with limited access and
password protection. Strict protocols for patient confidentiality and
privacy should be established and followed.

REFERRALS AND RESOURCES

Before discharge, the provider should ensure the patient understands
the results of the evaluation and has the opportunity to ask questions. A
risk assessment should be done by the provider or other qualified staff,
to include a discussion with the individual of safety concerns (involving current risks and perceived risks after discharge). The provider
should engage the patient in establishing a treatment plan as developmentally appropriate. Transparency and shared decision-­making are
key elements of a trauma-­informed approach. Healthcare providers
must comply with mandatory reporting laws in their state or country,
but in doing so, should make every effort to avoid causing harm to the
patient or their family. If a mandatory report is necessary, this should
be discussed with the patient before making the call to authorities, so
the individual is aware of actions being taken. For nonmandated referrals, patient permission is needed.
For those practicing within the United States, assistance on interpreting laws, working with individuals who may have been trafficked,
making reports to authorities, and identifying local referral sources
may be obtained by contacting the National Human Trafficking
Hotline (1-­888-­373-­7888). The hotline has trained staff to assist trafficked persons and professionals alike, including interpreters for over
200 languages. Additional assistance may be obtained by contacting
state or local law enforcement and antitrafficking task forces or local
child advocacy centers (free-­standing or hospital-­based facilities that
provide services for children and families who have experienced child
abuse and/or neglect). In other countries, “helplines” and “hotlines”
may be used to seek assistance for those who are being trafficked and
those at risk. It is important for the healthcare provider to be aware of
local, state, and national resources for individuals experiencing human
trafficking.
Affected patients have numerous needs that extend beyond the range
of the healthcare provider’s ability to respond. A multidisciplinary team
approach is needed to ensure the child is provided with necessary food,
shelter, crisis management, language interpretation, immigration assistance, mental health and medical care, educational needs, and other
services. Such a team may include local victim service providers, shelter

workers, law enforcement, child advocacy center staff, representatives
of sexual assault crisis centers, and victim advocates. Potential health-­
related referrals may be found in Table 16.5. To increase the likelihood
that the patient and family will obtain the services they desire, it is helpful for the provider to make a “warm handoff ” to a referral agency, either
contacting agency staff directly or allowing the patient/trusted caregiver
to make the call to the agency before leaving the health facility.
Children and adolescents who experience trafficking may face
considerable discrimination and social stigma from the public
and from professionals. They may be viewed as “consenting” participants, “illegal immigrants” who somehow “deserve” maltreatment, or “bad” youth who are responsible for their own actions.
They may face discrimination related to risk factors such as poverty, gender identity, or systemic racism. In some countries, laws on
sexual exploitation do not include boys, and cultural beliefs foster
the attitude that males cannot be victimized. This complicates service provision and support for male patients who have experienced
trafficking. Variations in the age of consent may result in a child
being considered an adult in one country and a child in another, the
former condition limiting access to adequate support or increasing the likelihood of being viewed as a criminal offender. For these
reasons and others, it is important for the healthcare provider to
advocate for the patient’s best interests when interacting with other
professionals and emphasize the need for comprehensive, sustained,
trauma-­informed services.
If responsible for long-­term care of the patient, the provider
should consider that treatment needs change over time, so treatment plans must be reevaluated periodically. Continuity of care is
important but can be challenging when the individual is moved to
another city, is transported back to the home country, or is retrafficked. Ongoing communication with external agencies and other
healthcare providers can be extremely helpful, along with assignment of a case manager to help ensure referrals are in place in destination towns or villages.

Chapter 17

Abused and Neglected
Children
Howard Dubowitz and Wendy G. Lane
The abuse and neglect (maltreatment) of children are pervasive
problems worldwide, with short-­and long-­term physical and mental health, cognitive, social, and economic consequences. Primary
care professionals (PCPs) serving children have an important role
in helping address this problem. In addition to their responsibility to identify maltreated children and help ensure their protection,
health, and well-­being, PCPs can also play vital roles related to prevention, treatment, and advocacy. While securing a child’s safety is
a priority, the child welfare system also aims to improve families’
functioning and enable them to adequately care for their children.

DEFINITIONS

Abuse is defined as acts of commission, neglect as acts of omission.
The U.S. government offers a minimal definition of child abuse as “any
recent act or failure to act on the part of a parent or caretaker, which
results in death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse or
exploitation, or an act or failure to act which presents an imminent risk
of serious harm.” Many states include other household members and
a broader set of circumstances. Children may face situations in which
no actual harm has occurred and no imminent risk of serious harm is
evident, yet potential harm is a concern. Many states include potential
harm in their child abuse laws. This is critical to preventing maltreatment, although predicting harm is inherently difficult. Two aspects
should be considered: the likelihood and the severity of the potential
harm.
Physical abuse includes beating, shaking, burning, drowning, suffocating, and biting. Physical punishment remains controversial,
although it is increasingly being prohibited. The Global Initiative to
End All Physical Punishment of Children reported that 62 countries
have banned physical punishment in all settings, including the home;
135 have done so for schools, and governments in 27 other countries
have committed to full prohibition. In the United States, physical punishment in the home remains lawful in all states, and 20 still permit it
in schools.
The threshold for when physical punishment should be considered as abuse is unclear. One can consider any injury beyond transient redness such as from a slap as abuse. Proponents of physical
punishment suggest that if parents spank a child, it should be limited to the buttocks, be over clothing, and should never involve the
head and neck. When parents use objects other than a hand, the
potential for serious harm increases. Acts of serious violence (e.g.,
throwing a hard object, slapping an infant’s face) should be seen as
abusive even if no injury ensues; significant potential harm exists.
Although some PCPs think that hitting is acceptable under limited
conditions, almost all prefer more constructive approaches to discipline. The American Academy of Pediatrics issued a policy statement clearly opposing the use of physical punishment. Although
many agree that hitting a child should never be accepted, and
research has amply documented the potential harm, there remains
a reluctance in the United States to label hitting as abuse—unless
there is an injury. Clearly the emotional impact of being hit may
leave the most worrisome and lasting scars, long after the bruises
fade and the fractures heal.
Neglect refers to omissions in care resulting in actual or potential harm. Omissions include inadequate healthcare, education,

supervision, or protection from hazards in the environment and
unmet physical needs (e.g., clothing, food) and inadequate emotional support. A preferable alternative to focusing on caregiver
omissions is to instead consider the basic needs (or rights) of children (e.g., adequate food, clothing, shelter, healthcare, education,
nurturance). Neglect occurs when a need is not adequately met and
results in actual or potential harm, whatever the reasons. A broad
definition concerned with children’s needs fosters a more comprehensive understanding of what contributes to neglect in addition to
the potential parental role. A child-­focused definition also offers a
more constructive approach to ensure a child’s needs are adequately
met in contrast to one that narrowly focuses on and blames parents. A child whose health is jeopardized or harmed by not receiving necessary care experiences medical neglect. This view enables
professionals to approach the problem in terms of what the child
needs, rather than focusing on what parents did badly. Not all such
situations necessarily require a referral to child protective services
(CPS); less intrusive initial efforts may be appropriate.
Psychologic abuse includes verbal abuse and humiliation and
acts that scare or terrorize a child. Although this form of abuse
may be extremely harmful to children, resulting in problems such
as depression, anxiety, poor self-­esteem, and lack of empathy, CPS
seldom becomes involved because of the difficulty in proving such
allegations. PCPs should still carefully consider this form of maltreatment, even if the concern fails to reach a legal or agency threshold for referral. These children and families can still benefit from
counseling and other services. Many children experience more than
one form of maltreatment; CPS is more likely to address psychologic abuse in the context of other forms of maltreatment.

INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE

Abuse and neglect mostly occur behind closed doors and
often remain a dark, well-­kept secret. Rates of maltreatment are
thus difficult to estimate. Nevertheless, the problem is globally
prevalent.

Global Situation

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that nearly 3 in 4
children, or 300 million children aged 2-­4 years, regularly suffer physical punishment and/or psychologic violence at the hands of parents.
In addition, as many as 1 in 5 women and 1 in 13 men report having
been sexually abused as a child. Less international research has been
done on child neglect. Nevertheless, neglect too is clearly a global problem. For example, a large study (n = 41,194) of Balkan countries found
lifetime rates of neglect ranging from 23% in Romania to 48% in Bosnia. Among Hong Kong adults, 45% reported a history of childhood
neglect. Rates as high as 94% of children for emotional neglect and
89% for physical neglect were found in Burundi, a country severely
affected by civil war and political violence. Varying definitions, policies, and practices concerning child maltreatment preclude comparing
rates across countries.

United States

There were 4.4 million reports to CPS involving 7.9 million children in the United States in 2019. Of the 656,000 children with
substantiated reports (8.9 per 1,000 children), 75% experienced
neglect (including 2.3% medical neglect), 17.5% physical abuse,
9.3% sexual abuse, and 6.8% psychologic maltreatment. Neglect
is by far the most common form of maltreatment referred to CPS,
involving 7 per 1,000 children. Although there had been a welcome
decline in rates beginning in the early 1990s, rates increased in 2014
and 2015 and stayed stable until the COVID-­19 pandemic, when
reports of physical abuse increased. Medical personnel made 11%
of all reports. Sources other than official CPS statistics indicate that
the incidence of maltreatment is far greater than what gets reported
to CPS. In a community survey, for example, 3% of parents reported
using very severe violence (e.g., hitting with fist, burning, using gun
or knife) toward their child in the prior year.

Chapter 17 u Abused and Neglected Children
ETIOLOGY

Child maltreatment seldom has a single cause; rather, multiple and
interacting biopsychosocial risk factors at four levels usually interact
and contribute to the problem. At the individual level, a child’s disability
or behavioral challenges or a parent’s depression or substance use predispose a child to maltreatment. At the familial level, intimate partner
(or domestic) violence jeopardizes children’s health and development.
Influential community factors include stressors such as dangerous
neighborhoods with few supports or recreational facilities. Professional
inaction may contribute to neglect, such as when the treatment plan
is not clearly communicated or risk factors are ignored. Broad societal
factors, such as poverty and its many associated burdens, also contribute significantly to maltreatment. The WHO estimates the rate of child
homicide is approximately twofold higher in low-­income compared to
high-­income countries (2.58 vs 1.21 per 100,000 population). Nevertheless, children at all income levels can be maltreated, and PCPs need to
guard against biases concerning minoritized and low-­income families.
In contrast, protective factors, such as family supports or a parent’s concern for their child, may buffer risk factors and protect
children from maltreatment. Deliberately identifying and incorporating protective factors is vital to intervening effectively. One can
say to a parent who did not fill a prescription, for example, “I can
see how much you love [child’s name]. What can we do to keep
them out of the hospital?” In sum, child maltreatment results from
a complex interplay among risk and protective factors. A single
parent who has a colicky baby and who recently lost their job has
multiple risk factors, but a loving grandparent may be protective.
A good assessment and understanding of both risk and protective
factors guide an appropriate response.

OUTCOMES

All forms of child maltreatment jeopardize children’s physical and
emotional health and their cognitive and social development, manifesting in a wide array of possible problems—in the short and the
long term. Problems in adolescence and adulthood include health
risk behaviors (e.g., smoking, alcohol, and substance use), mental health problems (e.g., anxiety, depression, suicide attempt),
and physical health problems (e.g., heart disease, cancer). Maltreated children are also at risk for becoming maltreating parents.
The impact of neuroendocrine stress responses to child abuse and
neglect on the developing brain may partly explain some of these
sequelae.
Some maltreated children appear to be resilient and function relatively well, perhaps owing to protective factors or interventions. Still,
PCPs and parents need to be sensitive to the possibility of later problems (“sleeper effects”). The benefits of intervention have been found
in even the most severely neglected children, such as those rescued
from Romanian orphanages in the early 1990s, who were adopted—
the earlier, the better. That said, resilience is a relative concept, and few
severely maltreated children escape unscathed.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Child abuse and neglect can manifest in a myriad of ways (Table
17.1). A critical element of physical abuse is the lack of a plausible
history other than inflicted trauma. The onus is on the clinician
to carefully consider the differential diagnosis and not jump to
conclusions.
Bruises are the most common manifestation of physical abuse.
Features suggestive of abuse include (1) bruising in a preambulatory
infant (occurring in just 2% of such infants), (2) bruising of padded
and less exposed areas (buttocks, cheeks, ears, neck, genitalia), (3) patterned bruising conforming to the shape of an object (Fig. 17.1), and
(4) multiple bruises, especially if clearly of different ages. Earlier suggestions for estimating the age of bruises, however, have long been
discredited. It is very difficult to precisely age bruises. The TEN-­4
FACESp mnemonic is useful for when to suspect abuse in children
under 4 years of age: torso, ear, neck, frenulum, angle of jaw, cheeks
[fleshy], eyelids, subconjunctivae, and patterned, as well as any bruise

prediction rule is 95.6% sensitive and 87.1% specific for identifying
abuse.
In nonmobile infants, bruises are considered a sentinel injury
because of the low likelihood of noninflicted injury. Bruises are the
most common injury to be missed or misdiagnosed among children
who later present with fatal or near-­fatal injuries. Other sentinel
injuries include oropharyngeal injuries in children <6 months of age
and subconjunctival hemorrhage in healthy children under 4 years
of age.
Conditions such as birthmarks, including slate gray nevus (congenital dermal melanocytosis or Mongolian spots), can be confused with
bruises and abuse. Other mimics are noted in Table 17.2. These skin
markings are not tender and do not rapidly change color or size. An
underlying medical explanation for bruises may exist, such as blood
dyscrasias (hemophilia) or connective tissue disorders (Ehlers-­Danlos
syndrome). The history or examination usually provides clues to
these conditions. Hemorrhagic edema of infancy and IgA vasculitis
(Henoch-­Schönlein purpura) is the most common vasculitis in young

children, and may be confused with abuse. The pattern and location of
bruises caused by abuse are usually different from those caused by a
coagulopathy. Noninflicted bruises are characteristically anterior and
over bony prominences, such as shins and foreheads. However, the
presence of a medical disorder does not preclude abuse.
Cultural practices can cause bruising. Cao gio, or coining, is a Southeast Asian folkloric therapy. A hard object is vigorously rubbed on
the skin, causing petechiae or purpura. Cupping is another approach,
popular in the Middle East. A heated glass is applied to the skin, often
on the back. As it cools, a vacuum forms, leading to perfectly circular
bruises. The context here is important, and such circumstances should
not be considered abusive (see Chapter 12).
A careful history of bleeding problems in the patient and first-­degree
relatives is needed. If a bleeding disorder is suspected, a complete blood
count, including platelet count, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time, should be obtained. More extensive testing, such as for
factors VIII, IX, and XIII activity and von Willebrand disease, should
be considered in consultation with a hematologist.
Bites have a characteristic pattern of one or two opposing arches with
multiple bruises. They can be inflicted by an adult, another child, an
animal, or the patient. Forensic odontologists developed guidelines for
distinguishing adult from child and human from animal bites. However, several recent studies have identified problems with the accuracy
and consistency of bite mark analysis.
Burns may be inflicted, noninflicted, or the result of inadequate
supervision. Scalding burns may result from immersion or splash.
Immersion burns, when a child is forcibly held in hot water, show
a clear delineation between the burned and healthy skin and uniform depth (Fig. 17.2). They may have a sock or glove distribution.
Splash marks are usually absent, unlike when a child inadvertently
encounters hot water. Symmetric burns are strongly suggestive of
abuse, as are burns of the buttocks and perineum. Although most
often noninflicted, splash burns may also result from abuse. Burns
from hot objects such as curling irons, radiators, steam irons,
metal grids, hot knives, and cigarettes leave patterns indicating the
object (Fig. 17.3). A child is likely to try to rapidly escape from a
hot object; thus burns that are extensive and deep reflect more than
fleeting contact and suggest abuse.
Several conditions mimic abusive burns, such as brushing against a
hot radiator, car seat burns, congenital insensitivity to pain syndromes,
and folk remedies such as moxibustion. Impetigo may resemble cigarette burns. Cigarette burns are usually 7-­10 mm across, whereas impetigo has lesions of varying size. Noninflicted cigarette burns are usually
oval and superficial.
Neglect frequently contributes to childhood burns. Children left
home alone may be burned in house fires. A parent taking drugs

may be used to inflict injury on a child.
Often the choice of an instrument is
a matter of convenience. Marks tend
to silhouette or outline the shape of
the instrument. The possibility of intentional trauma should prompt a
high degree of suspicion when injuries
to a child are geometric, paired, mirrored, of various ages or types, or on
relatively protected parts of the body.

may cause a fire and be unable to protect a child. Exploring children
left unattended may pull hot liquids onto themselves. Liquids cool
as they flow downward so that the burn is most severe and broad
proximally, often in an inverted triangle pattern. If the child is wearing a diaper or clothing, the fabric may absorb the hot water and
cause burns worse than otherwise expected. Burns through clothing
tend to have an irregular pattern. Some circumstances are difficult
to foresee, and a single burn resulting from a momentary lapse in
supervision should not automatically be construed as neglect.
Concluding whether a burn was inflicted depends on the history,
burn pattern, and the child’s capabilities. A delay in seeking healthcare
may result from the burn initially appearing minor, before blistering
or becoming infected. This circumstance may represent reasonable
behavior and should not be automatically deemed neglectful. A scene
investigation by law enforcement is often valuable (e.g., testing the water
temperature).
Fractures that strongly suggest abuse include those of the posterior ribs, scapula, sternum, and spinous processes and classic
metaphyseal lesions—especially in young children (Table 17.3).
These fractures all require more force than would be expected from
a minor fall or routine handling and activities of a child. Rib and
sternal fractures rarely result from cardiopulmonary resuscitation,
even when performed by untrained adults. The recommended two-­
finger or two-­thumb technique for infants may, however, produce
anterolateral rib fractures. Most common in abused infants are
rib (Fig. 17.4), metaphyseal (Fig. 17.5), and skull fractures. Femoral and humeral fractures in ­nonambulatory infants are also very
worrisome for abuse. In contrast, with increasing mobility and
running, toddlers can fall with enough rotational force to cause a
spiral, femoral fracture. Multiple fractures in various stages of healing are suggestive of abuse. In some circumstances, such as when
there are multiple or repeated fractures or a family history of such,
underlying medical conditions need to be considered. Clavicular,
femoral, supracondylar humeral, and distal extremity fractures in
children older than 2 years are most likely noninflicted unless they
are multiple or accompanied by other signs of abuse. Few fractures
are pathognomonic of abuse; all must be considered together with
the history and child’s development.
The differential diagnosis includes conditions that increase susceptibility to fractures, such as osteopenia and osteogenesis imperfecta, metabolic and nutritional disorders (e.g., scurvy, rickets),
renal osteodystrophy, osteomyelitis, congenital syphilis, and neoplasia (see Table 17.2). Some have pointed to possible rickets and
low but subclinical levels of vitamin D as being responsible for fractures thought to be due to abuse. The evidence, however, refutes
this supposition. Features of congenital or metabolic conditions

associated with noninflicted fractures include family history of
recurrent fractures after minor trauma, abnormally shaped cranium, dentinogenesis imperfecta, blue sclera, impaired hearing,
craniotabes, ligamentous laxity, bowed legs, hernia, and translucent
skin. Subperiosteal new bone formation is a nonspecific finding seen
in infectious, traumatic, and metabolic disorders. In young infants,
new bone formation may be a normal physiologic finding; it is usually bilateral, symmetric, and less than 2 mm in depth.
The evaluation of a fracture should include a skeletal survey
in children less than 24 months of age when abuse seems possible
(Table 17.4). Multiple radiographs with different views are needed;
“babygrams” (one or two films of the entire body) should be avoided.
If a fracture is found or when the survey is normal but concern for
an occult injury remains, a follow-­up survey should be completed 2
weeks later, as it may reveal fractures not apparent initially. Omission
of skull, spine, and pelvis films on repeat survey reduces radiation
exposure while still capturing most occult fractures.
In corroborating the history and the injury, the age of a fracture can
be crudely estimated (Table 17.5). Soft tissue swelling subsides in 2-­21
days. Subperiosteal new bone is visible within 4-­21 days. Loss of definition of the fracture line and visible soft callus formation occur on a
similar timeline. Hard callus is visible between 14 and 90 days. These
ranges are shorter in infancy and longer in children with poor nutritional status or a chronic underlying disease. Fractures of flat bones
such as the skull do not form a callus and cannot be aged, although soft
tissue swelling indicates recency (i.e., within the prior week).

Abusive head trauma (AHT) results in significant morbidity and
mortality. Abusive injury may be caused by direct impact, asphyxia,
shaking, or a combination. Subdural hematomas (Fig. 17.6); retinal
hemorrhages, especially when extensive and involving multiple layers; brain parenchymal injury; and fractures (often rib and classic
metaphyseal lesions) strongly suggest AHT, especially when they occur
together. Infants’ poor neck muscle tone and relatively large heads
make them vulnerable to acceleration-­deceleration forces if severely
shaken, leading to AHT. Children may lack external signs of injury,
even with serious intracranial trauma. The clinical presentation varies, ranging from nonspecific lethargy, to vomiting (without diarrhea),
changing neurologic status or seizures, or coma. In all preverbal children, the possibility of AHT should be considered when children present with these signs or symptoms.
Acute intracranial trauma is best evaluated via CT. CT helps identify bone and soft tissue injury. Some centers use fast-­sequence MRI
to reduce radiation exposure, but the sensitivity may not be as good
as CT. MRIs are helpful in differentiating extraaxial fluid, determining the approximate time of injuries, assessing parenchymal injury,
and identifying vascular anomalies. Neck imaging may identify spinal
subdural blood and ligamentous, spinal cord, and nerve root injuries.
MRIs are best obtained 5-­7 days after an acute injury. Other causes
of subdural hemorrhage in infants include arteriovenous malformations, coagulopathies, birth trauma, tumor, and infections (see Table
17.2). Glutaric aciduria type 1 can present with intracranial bleeding
and should be considered. When AHT is suspected, possible injuries
elsewhere—especially skeletal and abdominal—should be ruled out.
Retinal hemorrhages are an important marker of AHT (Fig. 17.7). Whenever AHT is being considered, a dilated indirect eye examination by a pediatric ophthalmologist should be performed. Although retinal hemorrhages
can be found in other conditions, hemorrhages that are multiple, involve
more than one retinal layer, and extend to the periphery are very suspicious for abuse. The mechanism is likely repeated acceleration-­deceleration
caused by shaking. Traumatic retinoschisis points strongly to abuse.
With other causes of retinal hemorrhages, the pattern is usually different from that seen in child abuse. After birth, many newborns have
them, but they disappear by 2-­6 weeks. Coagulopathies (particularly
leukemia), retinal diseases, carbon monoxide poisoning, and glutaric
aciduria may be responsible. Severe noninflicted direct crush injury to
the head can rarely cause an extensive hemorrhagic retinopathy. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation rarely, if ever, causes retinal hemorrhages
in infants and children; if present, there are only a few hemorrhages
in the posterior pole. Hemoglobinopathies, diabetes mellitus, routine
play, minor noninflicted head trauma, and vaccinations do not appear
to cause retinal hemorrhage in children. Severe coughing or seizures
rarely cause retinal hemorrhages that could be confused with AHT.
The dilemma frequently posed is whether minor, everyday forces
can explain the findings seen in AHT. Simple linear skull fractures in
the absence of other suggestive evidence can be explained by a short
fall, although even that is unusual (1–2%); underlying brain injury
from short falls is exceedingly rare. Timing of brain injuries in cases
of abuse is not precise. In fatal cases, however, the trauma most likely
occurred very soon before the child became symptomatic.
Other manifestations of AHT may be seen. Raccoon eyes are associated with subgaleal hematomas after traction on the anterior hair
and scalp or a blow to the forehead. Neuroblastoma can present similarly. Bruises from attempted strangulation may be visible on the neck.
Choking or suffocation can cause hypoxic brain injury, often with no
external signs.
Oral lesions may present as bruised lips, bleeding, torn frenulum,
and dental trauma or multiple caries (neglect).
Abdominal trauma also accounts for significant morbidity and
mortality in abused children. Young children are especially vulnerable because of their relatively large abdomens and lax abdominal
musculature. A forceful blow or kick can cause hematomas of solid
organs (liver, spleen, kidney) from compression against the spine, as
well as hematomas (duodenal) or rupture (stomach) of hollow organs.
Intra-­abdominal bleeding may result from trauma to an organ or from

shearing of a vessel. More than one organ may be affected. Children
may present with cardiovascular failure or an acute abdomen, often
after a delay in care. Bilious vomiting without fever or peritoneal irritation suggests a duodenal hematoma, often the result of abuse.
The manifestations of abdominal trauma are often subtle, even with
severe injuries. Bruising of the abdominal wall is unusual, and symptoms may evolve slowly. Delayed perforation may occur days after the
injury; bowel strictures or a pancreatic pseudocyst can develop weeks
or months later. PCPs should consider screening for occult abdominal trauma when other evidence of physical abuse exists. Screening
should include liver and pancreatic enzyme levels and testing urine
for blood. When results indicate possible injury or if there is concern
about possible splenic, adrenal, or hepatic injury, an abdominal CT
is indicated.
Neglect is the most prevalent form of child maltreatment, with
potentially severe and lasting sequelae. It may manifest in many ways,
depending on which basic needs are not adequately met. Nonadherence

to medical treatment, for example, may aggravate the condition, as
may a delay in seeking healthcare. Inadequate food may manifest as
impaired growth; inattention to obesity is also a problem. Poor hygiene
may contribute to infected cuts or lesions. Inadequate supervision
contributes to injuries and ingestions. Children’s needs for mental
healthcare, dental care, and other healthcare may be inadequately met,
manifesting as neglect. Educational needs, particularly for children
with learning disabilities, are often not adequately met.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR ASSESSING POSSIBLE
PHYSICAL ABUSE AND NEGLECT

The heterogeneity of circumstances in situations of child maltreatment
precludes specific detailing of varied assessments. The following are
useful general principles:
• Given the complexity and possible ramifications of determining
child maltreatment, an interdisciplinary assessment is optimal,
with input from all involved professionals. Consultation with a physician expert in child abuse pediatrics is recommended.
• A thorough history should be obtained from the parent(s), optimally via separate interviews.
• Verbal children should be interviewed separately in a developmentally appropriate manner. Open-­ended questions (e.g., “Tell me
what happened”) are best. Some children need more directed

questioning (e.g., “How did you get that bruise?”); others need
multiple-­choice questions. Leading questions must be avoided (e.g.,
“Did your daddy hit you?”).
• A thorough physical examination is necessary.
• Careful documentation of the history and physical is essential. Verbatim quotes are valuable, including the question that prompted the
response. Photographs are helpful.
• For abuse, the assessment should answer these questions: What is
the evidence for concluding abuse? Have other diagnoses been ruled
out? What is the likely mechanism of the injury? When did the injury likely occur?
• For neglect, the assessment should answer these questions: Do
the circumstances indicate that the child’s needs have not been adequately met? Is there evidence of actual harm? Is there evidence of
potential harm and on what basis? Suboptimal treatment adherence
may not be ideal but lead to few or no consequences. What is the
nature of the neglect? Is there a pattern of neglect?
• It may be difficult to be certain regarding the likelihood of abuse or
neglect. The use of “possible” or “probable” is recommended when
uncertain. Inadequacies in the care children receive naturally fall
along a continuum, requiring a range of responses tailored to the individual family’s situation. Legal considerations or CPS practice may
discourage PCPs from labeling many circumstances as neglect. Even
if neglect does not meet a threshold for referring to CPS, professionals can still help ensure children’s needs are adequately met.
• Are there indications of other forms of maltreatment? Has there
been prior CPS involvement?
• A child’s safety is a paramount concern. What is the risk of imminent harm and of what severity?
• What is contributing to the maltreatment? Consider the categories
described in the section on etiology.
• What strengths/resources are there? This is as important as identifying problems.
• What treatment or services do the child and family need? What
interventions have been tried and with what results? Knowing the
nature of these interventions can be useful, especially from the parent’s perspective.
• What is the prognosis? Is the family motivated to improve the circumstances and accept help, or are they resistant? Are needed resources, formal and informal, available?
• Are there other children in the home who should be assessed for
maltreatment?

­varying sizes.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES FOR ADDRESSING PHYSICAL
ABUSE AND NEGLECT

The heterogeneity of circumstances also precludes specific details
regarding how to address different types of maltreatment. The following are general principles:
• Treat any medical problems.
• Help ensure the child’s safety, often in conjunction with CPS; this is a
priority. In some instances, hospitalization is the prudent approach.
• Convey concerns of maltreatment to parents, kindly but forthrightly.
Avoid blaming. It is natural to feel anger towards parents of maltreated children, but they need support and deserve respect.
• Have a means of addressing the difficult emotions child maltreatment can evoke in us. Self-­care is important.
• Be empathic and state interest in helping or suggest another healthcare professional.
• Know the laws and/or local CPS policies on referring child maltreatment. In the United States, the legal threshold for referring is typically “reason to believe” (or “reason to suspect”); one does not need
to be certain. Physical abuse and moderate to severe neglect warrant
a referral. In less severe neglect, less intrusive interventions may be
an appropriate initial response. For example, if an infant’s mild failure to gain sufficient weight is caused by an error in mixing the formula, parent education and perhaps a visiting nurse should be tried.
In contrast, severe growth faltering may require hospitalization, and,
if the contributing factors are particularly serious (e.g., a psychotic
mother), out-­of-­home placement may be needed. CPS can assess the
home environment and provide valuable insights.
• Referring child maltreatment to public agencies is never easy. Parental inadequacy or culpability is at least implicit, and parents
may become angry. PCPs should supportively inform families
directly of the referral to CPS; it can be explained constructively
as an effort to clarify the situation and provide help, as well as a
professional (and legal) responsibility. Words matter, and “referral” avoids the stigma of “report,” and it is what we commonly

do in healthcare. Explaining what the ensuing process is likely
to entail (e.g., a visit from a CPS worker and sometimes a police officer) may ease a parent’s anxiety. Parents are frequently
concerned that they might lose their child. PCPs can cautiously
reassure parents that CPS is responsible for helping children and
families and that, in most instances, children remain with their
parents. When CPS does not accept a referral or when it is not
substantiated, they may still facilitate supportive services such
as food, shelter, parenting resources, and childcare. PCPs can be
a useful liaison between the family and the public agencies and
should try to remain involved after referring to CPS.
• Help address contributory factors, prioritizing those that are most
important to the family and amenable to being remedied. Concrete
needs should not be overlooked; accessing food programs, obtaining
health insurance, enrolling children in preschool, and help finding
housing can make a valuable difference. Parents may need their own
problems addressed to enable them to adequately care for their children.
• E stablish specific objectives (e.g., no hitting, diabetes will be
adequately controlled), with measurable outcomes (e.g., urine
dipsticks, hemoglobin A1c). Similarly, advice should be specific
and limited to a few reasonable steps. A written (and perhaps
signed) contract can help establish the agreed-­upon plan and
help ensure it pans out.
• Engage the family in developing the plan—solicit their input and
agreement. Motivational interviewing (MI) offers a fundamentally different approach to working with parents (and older children and teens), forging a partnership, and understanding their
perceptions of an issue and how they think they can address it.
Knowledge and skills regarding MI can enhance the effectiveness
of PCPs (see Chapter 18).
• Deliberately identify protective factors or strengths—within and
outside the family; there are always some. Incorporating these in
one’s approach is a valuable way to engage parents and ensure plans
get implemented.
• Encourage informal supports (e.g., family, friends; invite fathers to
office visits). This is where most people get their support, not from
professionals. Consider support available through a family’s religious affiliation.
• Consider children’s specific needs. Too often, maltreated children do
not receive needed services.
• Be knowledgeable about community resources and facilitate appropriate referrals. Consider how to help ensure referrals pan out.
• Provide support, follow-­up, and review of progress, and adjust the
plan if needed.
• Recognize that maltreatment often requires long-­term intervention
with ongoing support and monitoring.

PREVENTION OF PHYSICAL ABUSE AND NEGLECT

An important aspect of prevention is that many of the efforts to
strengthen families and support parents should promote children’s
health, development, well-­being, and safety and prevent maltreatment. Medical responses to child maltreatment have typically
occurred after the fact; preventing the problem is preferable. PCPs
can help in several ways. An ongoing relationship offers opportunities to develop trust and knowledge of a family’s circumstances.
Astute observation of parent–child interactions can reveal useful
information.
Parent and child education regarding medical conditions helps to
ensure implementation of the treatment plan and to prevent neglect.
Possible barriers to treatment should be addressed. Practical strategies
such as writing down the plan can help. In addition, anticipatory guidance helps with positive parenting (see Chapter 20), diminishing the
risk of maltreatment. Hospital-­based programs that educate parents
about caring for a crying infant and the risks of shaking may help prevent AHT.

121

Screening for and addressing major psychosocial risk factors for
maltreatment such as parental depression, substance use, intimate
partner violence, major stress, and helping address identified problems, often via referrals, can help prevent maltreatment. Primary
care offers excellent opportunities to screen briefly for psychosocial
problems. The traditional organ system–focused review of systems
can be expanded to probe areas such as feelings about the child,
the parent’s own functioning, the relationship, possible depression,
disciplinary approaches, stressors, and supports. The Safe Environment for Every Kid (SEEK) model offers an evidence-­informed
approach for pediatric primary care to identify and help address
prevalent adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) (e.g., exposure to
intimate partner violence, parental depression, or substance use) or
social determinants of health (e.g., food insecurity, severe parental stress) that are also risk factors for child maltreatment. This
approach should incorporate working with protective factors and
use of MI principles in developing a plan jointly with the family.
Obtaining information directly from children or youth is also
important, especially given that separate interviews with teens have
become the norm. Any concerns identified on such screens require
at least a brief assessment and initial management, which may lead
to a referral for further evaluation and treatment. More frequent
office visits can be scheduled for support and counseling while
monitoring the situation. Other key family members (e.g., father, a
grandparent) might be invited to participate, thereby encouraging
informal support. Some practices arrange parent groups through
which problems and solutions are shared. PCPs also need to recognize their limitations and facilitate referrals to other community
resources.

ADVOCACY

PCPs can assist in understanding what contributed to a child’s maltreatment. When advocating for the best interest of the child and
family, addressing contributory factors at the individual, family, and
community levels is optimal. At the individual level, an example
of advocating on behalf of a child is explaining to a parent that an
active toddler is behaving normally and not intentionally annoying
the parent. Encouraging a parent to seek help dealing with a violent spouse, saying, for example, “You and your life are very important”; asking about substance use; and helping parents obtain health
insurance for their children are all forms of advocacy.
Efforts to improve family functioning, such as encouraging
fathers’ involvement in the lives of their children, are also examples
of advocacy. Remaining involved after a referral to CPS and helping
ensure needed services are provided is advocacy as well. In the community, PCPs can be influential advocates for improving resources
devoted to children and families. These include parenting programs, services for abused women and children, and recreational
facilities. They can be strong advocates for policies and programs at
the local, state, and national levels to benefit children and families.
The problems underpinning child maltreatment, such as poverty,
parental stress, substance use, and limited child-­rearing resources,
require policies and programs that enhance families’ abilities to care
for their children at least adequately. Examples in the United States
include Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
(SNAP), the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program, paid
family and medical leave, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC),
and childcare subsidies.
Child maltreatment is a complex problem without simple solutions. Through partnerships with parents and colleagues in child
protection, mental health, education, and law enforcement, PCPs
can make an enormous difference in the lives of many children and
families.

17.1 Sexual Abuse
Wendy G. Lane and Howard Dubowitz
See also Chapter 162.
Approximately 18% of females and 7% of males in the United
States are sexually abused at some point during childhood. Primary
care professionals (PCPs) serving children can play several roles in
addressing sexual abuse, including identification, referring to child
protective services (CPS) and/or law enforcement, testing for and
treating sexually transmitted infections, providing support and
reassurance, and providing guidance to prevent future sexual abuse.
In many jurisdictions throughout the United States, PCPs play a
mostly triage role, with the definitive medical evaluation conducted
by a child abuse specialist.

DEFINITION

Sexual abuse has been defined as “the involvement of dependent,
developmentally immature children and adolescents in sexual activities which they do not fully comprehend, to which they are unable to
give consent, or that violate the social taboos of family roles.” Sexual
abuse includes exposure to sexually explicit materials, oral-­genital
contact, genital-­to-­genital contact, genital-­to-­anal contact, and genital fondling. Any touching of “private parts” by parents or caregivers
in a context other than necessary care is inappropriate. It is important to note that sexual abuse does not have to involve direct touching or physical contact by the perpetrator. Showing pornography to
a child, filming or photographing a child in sexually explicit poses,
and encouraging or forcing a child to perform sex acts on another all
constitute sexual abuse. When these acts occur for financial gain or in
exchange for something of value, it is considered sexual exploitation.
Recruiting, enticing, harboring, transporting, providing, obtaining,
and/or maintaining a minor for the purpose of engaging in sexual
acts are forms of sex trafficking (see Chapter 16), a subset of sexual
exploitation.
Some legal definitions distinguish sexual abuse from sexual assault;
the former being committed by a parent or caregiver or household
member, and the latter being committed by someone without a custodial or any relationship to the child. For this chapter, the term sexual
abuse encompasses abuse, assault, and exploitation.

PRESENTATION OF SEXUAL ABUSE

Because physical findings are uncommon and behavioral findings
are often nonspecific, a more reliable means of identifying sexual
abuse is through a child’s history. Some children provide a clear,
spontaneous description of abuse to a trusted adult. Other children
provide less clear histories, such as not wanting to visit a particular person’s home or vaguely saying “something bad happened.”
Preschool-­aged children and those with limited language skills may
be developmentally unable to provide details about sexual acts or
timing. Such lack of detail may unfortunately dissuade adults from
trusting the account and referring. Because PCPs are mandated
reporters, they should have a low threshold for referring young
children.
Sexual abuse may be discovered when another person witnesses
the abuse or discovers evidence such as sexually explicit photographs
or videos. There are also children, with and without symptoms, who
will not be identified at any point during their childhood, and perhaps
never.
Behavioral changes may be the first indication of possible abuse.
Children may exhibit sexually explicit behavior outside the norm
for their age and developmental level. It can be tricky to distinguish normal from concerning behavior, especially given children’s
increasing and prevalent exposure to sexual material and information over recent decades. For preschool- and school-­age children,
behavior thought to be normal includes curiosity about their own
body and differences between boys and girls. Touching their own
genitals, masturbation, and undressing in front of others are also

common. Worrisome sexual behavior includes compulsive masturbation (i.e., continuing in public areas even after being told to stop),
attempting to perform sex acts on adults or other children, or asking
adults or children to perform sex acts on them. Teen sexual behavior thought to be normal includes interest in media with sexual
themes, looking up sexual information on the internet, demanding
more privacy, masturbation, and sexual contact with teens of the
same or opposite sex. Worrisome teenage behaviors include sexual
promiscuity, engaging in prostitution, and engaging in sexual acts
with younger children or with animals. Sexting has become common among teenagers and requires a discussion between parents
and teens about its risks. Sexting that involves extortion or trafficking is very concerning; in many states trafficking requires mandated
reporting to CPS.
It is important to recognize that in addition to sexual abuse, some
sexualized behavior could also result from other exposure (e.g., a child
who enters their parents’ bedroom at night to find their parents having
sex), from neglect (e.g., parents watching pornographic movies where
a child can see them), from exposure to sexual behavior by other children who may have been abused or exposed to inappropriate sexual
behavior or materials, or from information discussed and shared by
peers.
A number of other behavior changes, although not specific for
sexual abuse, are common among children who have been sexually abused. These include social withdrawal, acting out, increased
clinginess or fearfulness, distractibility, learning difficulties, and
behavioral regression such as secondary enuresis. Teenagers may
become depressed, experiment with drugs or alcohol, or run away
from home. Therefore sexual abuse should usually be considered
when addressing a wide variety of child behavior and mental health
problems.
Physical signs of sexual abuse are uncommon and are seen in only
about 5% of children who undergo medical examination, usually
soon after the abuse occurred. The absence of physical findings can
often be explained by the type and timing of sexual contact. Abusive
acts such as fondling or even digital penetration may not cause any
injury. In addition, many children do not disclose abuse until days,
weeks, months, or even years after the abuse occurred. Because genital injuries usually heal within days, injuries are generally not seen
by the time a child presents for medical evaluation. Clearly, a normal
genital exam does not rule out the possibility or probability of abuse
and should not influence the decision to refer to CPS. Physical findings that may indicate sexual abuse include genital or anal pain, anogenital bleeding, or discharge. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs),
including gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomonas beyond the neonatal period, are highly suspicious for abuse. Pregnancy, too, may be
the result of abuse. Rarely, there are physical signs of healed trauma,
such as a complete hymenal transection (i.e., part of the posterior
hymen is missing).
All 50 U.S. states mandate that professionals refer suspected sexual abuse to CPS, and many require reporting of sex trafficking.
The specific criteria or threshold for “reason to suspect” is generally
not defined by state law. Clearly, referrals do not require certainty
that abuse occurred. Therefore it may be appropriate to refer a child
with worrisome sexual behavior when no alternative explanation
is plausible and the child does not clearly confirm or deny abuse.

THE ROLE OF THE PCP IN ASSESSING AND
ADDRESSING POSSIBLE SEXUAL ABUSE

Speaking with parents about possible abuse: When a parent raises
concern for sexual abuse, PCPs should have the child leave the room
before obtaining additional information from the parent alone to avoid
influencing the child. The child healthcare professional should gather
details regarding the parent’s concern to help discriminate between
possible sexual abuse and other behavioral or health issues. For example, parents may be worried about a child’s normal sexual behavior, or
they may assume that a nonspecific finding such as vulvar irritation
is the result of abuse. In these situations, reassurance and treatment

Chapter 17 u Abused and Neglected Children
of the medical issue may suffice. PCPs should document the parental
concerns, clearly indicating the source of the information. If a child
reported abuse to a parent, documentation should include what questions the parent asked to elicit the disclosure or what triggered it. Additional evaluation should include a review of systems for behavioral
and urogenital problems. Parents should be asked whether there are
other children in the home, school, or childcare who may have been
exposed to the alleged offender; this information should be shared with
CPS, as these children may benefit from a precautionary interview or
exam at the local child advocacy center (CAC). Parents who have experienced sexual abuse themselves may disclose this information to the
child healthcare professional, and they may have a heightened concern
about abuse of their children and the sequelae. In these situations, the
PCP should discuss mental health services for the parent. Some states
require reporting of sexual abuse even when the survivor is an adult.
Speaking with children about possible abuse: Children with suspected sexual abuse may present to the PCP’s office with a clear history of abuse or more subtle indicators. A private, brief conversation
between PCP and child provides an opportunity for the child to speak
in their own words. Doing this may be especially important when the
parent does not believe or support the child. Telling parents that a private conversation is standard in such circumstances can be reassuring.
When speaking with a child, it is essential to first establish rapport, starting with general and open-­ended questions; for example:
“Tell me about school” and “What are your favorite things to do?”
It helps to explain the purpose of the evaluation and why it is being
done. For example, “Your mom is worried that someone may have
hurt you and we want to make sure you’re healthy and safe.” Questions about sexual abuse should focus on a minimally adequate
history (i.e., gathering enough information to determine if sexual
abuse may have happened and whether there is a need to refer to
CPS). If a referral is made to CPS, a multidisciplinary investigation
will likely be initiated, including an extensive forensic interview.
Questions should also be nonleading (e.g., avoid asking questions
such as “who touched you there?”). It helps to explain that sometimes children are hurt or bothered by others and that one wonders
whether that might have happened to the child. Open-­ended questions, such as “Can you tell me more about that?” allow the child
to add information and clarification in their own words. The PCP
should document the child’s statements in quotation marks and the
source. Documenting the questions that elicited the child’s response
should clarify whether questions were leading or not. Very young
children and those with developmental delay may lack the verbal
skills to describe what happened. In this situation, the parent’s history may provide enough information to warrant a CPS referral
without interviewing the child.
Medical referral: Because delayed disclosure is common, most
children do not need an urgent expert medical evaluation (Fig.
17.8). Indications for one include recent abuse (i.e., within the past
3-­5 days), current pain or bleeding, and severe child or parental
emotional distress. It is optimal for children suspected of having
been sexually abused to be evaluated in a child-­f riendly setting and
by professionals skilled in this field. Because emergency departments may not have a child abuse expert and can be busy, noisy, and
lacking in privacy, examination at an alternative location such as a
CAC or outpatient clinic is preferable, when possible. If the exam is
not urgent, it is best that the evaluation be done at a time when the
child is not tired and cranky.
Referring PCPs should be familiar with the triage procedures in
their communities, including the referral sites for both acute and
nonacute evaluations, timeframes for when an evaluation is considered acute, and whether there are different referral sites for prepubertal and postpubertal children. Depending on the jurisdiction,
the site may be an emergency department, a CAC, or an outpatient
clinic. For the prepubertal child, if abuse is thought to have occurred
in the previous 72 hours and history suggests direct contact, forensic evidence collection (e.g., external genital, vaginal, anal, and oral
swabs, sometimes referred to as a rape kit) may be indicated, and the

child should be referred to a site equipped to do this. Some centers
may have shorter or longer cutoffs (e.g., 24 hours or 5 days). If the
last suspected incident of abuse occurred more than 72 hours prior,
the likelihood of recovering forensic evidence is extremely low,
making forensic evidence collection unnecessary. For postpubertal
females, it is recommended that forensic evidence be collected up
to 120 hours after the abuse—as for adult women. The extended
timeframe relates to semen possibly remaining in the postpubertal vaginal vault for more than 72 hours. Some jurisdictions extend
the time for collecting forensic evidence up to 10-­15 days if there
has been penetration and possible ejaculation. The National Institute of Justice suggests considering a 9-­day time frame based on
one study.
Physical examination of the child with suspected sexual abuse:
Children suspected of having been sexually abused may benefit
from a brief evaluation and examination of their anogenital area
to determine whether and when an expert medical evaluation is
needed. Unfortunately, many physicians are unfamiliar with genital anatomy, particularly in the prepubertal girl (Figs. 17.9 and
17.10). Nevertheless, signs of trauma such as bruising, abrasions,
and bleeding or of infection may be apparent. Because about 95%
of children who undergo a medical evaluation after sexual abuse
have normal exams, the role of the PCP is often simply to be able
to distinguish a normal exam from findings indicative of common
medical concerns (e.g., diaper dermatitis) or trauma, or to reassure a parent whose preschooler is touching themself. Unsuspected
injuries or medical problems such as labial adhesions, imperforate
hymen, or urethral prolapse may be identified. In addition, reassurance about the child’s physical health may often allay anxiety for the
child and family.
When concerns about sexual abuse arise because of genital findings or complaints, it is important to assess for and rule out medical
problems that can be confused with abuse. Several genital findings
may raise concern about abuse but often have alternative explanations. For example, genital redness in a prepubertal child is usually
caused by nonspecific vulvovaginitis, diaper dermatitis, or infection
with a nonsexually transmitted organism such as staphylococcus or

group A streptococcus. It is often apparent that the diffuse redness
is unlikely to be the result of trauma. Lichen sclerosis is an uncommon cause of redness and usually presents with vulvar and/or perianal atrophy and hypopigmentation, often in a figure 8 pattern.
Vaginal discharge can be caused by STIs, but also by poor hygiene,
foreign body, the onset of puberty, or infection with Salmonella,
Shigella, or Yersinia. Genital ulcers can be caused by herpes simplex
virus (HSV) and syphilis, but also by Epstein-­Barr virus, varicella-­
zoster, Crohn’s disease, and Behçet’s disease. Genital bleeding can
be caused by urethral prolapse, vaginal foreign body, or noninflicted trauma.

The medical exam should begin with a general exam of the child.
Doing so enables the child to become comfortable with the exam process before the genital exam and may identify other evidence of maltreatment or health problems. For prepubertal children, the parent
should be present to provide comfort and reassurance. Older children
should be given the option of having a parent present. The American
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that whenever “private”
parts are examined (i.e., genitals, breast, anus), a chaperone should
be present. In prepubertal children, this can be a parent. For adolescents, the chaperone should be a clinical staff member, unless the
teen objects. If so, the PCP may have a parent be present if all three

are amenable. The PCP may decline to do an exam if the teen refuses
a chaperone.
The female genital exam is done with the child in the frog-­leg supine
position or the adolescent in the lithotomy position. Labial separation and
labial traction, with gentle tugging apart and down of the labia majora,
provide a view of the hymen. Any suspected abnormalities should be
confirmed by also examining the child in the prone knee-­chest position.
Supine knee-­chest is the best way to examine the anus. Internal vaginal and
anal exams are rarely needed. If there is significant bleeding or a persistent
discharge, a referral to an expert in child abuse is recommended.
Referral to a child abuse specialist: Referral to a child abuse specialist will help ensure that findings indicative or suggestive of abuse
are appropriately identified and documented. It is considered the
standard of care to use a colposcope or camera for the genital exam
to magnify the genital and anal tissues for improved visualization
and to take photographs or video as potential evidence and for peer
review. Child abuse experts can identify mimics of sexual abuse, test
for and treat STIs, and address child or parental concerns.
Testing for STIs: Testing for STIs is not indicated for most children but is warranted in certain situations (Table 17.6). Culture
was considered the gold standard for diagnosing vaginal gonorrhea
(Chapter 238) and chlamydia (Chapter 272) infections in children.
Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for gonorrhea and chlamydia by either vaginal swab or urine in prepubertal girls is as, or
more, sensitive than culture. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) allow for such NAAT testing
as an alternative to culture. Because obtaining vaginal swabs can
be uncomfortable, particularly for prepubertal girls, urine testing is
preferable, using a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved
assay. Although the FDA has not approved NAATs for the diagnosis
of gonorrhea or chlamydia infections of the throat or anus, they
may be used if the laboratory has performed internal validation
with reference standards. Although little data on the use of urine
NAAT testing in prepubertal boys are available, the CDC has indicated that there is no reason to suspect that test performance in
children and youth would be different from adults. Thus urine testing of them too appears adequate.

treatment guidelines, 2021. MMWR Recomm Rep. 2021;70(4):1–184.

For all NAAT testing in females and males, the child should not
receive presumptive treatment at the time of testing. Instead, a positive NAAT test should be confirmed by repeating the test on the
original sample or on a new sample. Whereas the CDC previously
recommended confirmatory testing with a different FDA-­approved
assay, the 2021 Sexually Transmitted Infection Treatment Guidelines no longer require this. Gonorrhea and chlamydia in prepubertal children rarely cause ascending infection; thus waiting for
a definitive diagnosis before treatment holds little risk for pelvic
inflammatory disease.
Testing for Trichomonas vaginalis is by culture, NAAT, or wet
mount. Wet mount requires the presence of vaginal secretions, viewing must be immediate for optimal results, and sensitivity is only

44–68%; therefore false-­negative tests are common. NAAT tests for
Trichomonas should only be performed using FDA-­approved products. Positive tests should be confirmed using the same sample or
a repeat collection. Point-­of-­care tests for Trichomonas, done at the
PCP’s office, have not been validated for prepubertal children and
should not be used.
Obtaining a blood sample for HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B testing should be considered, particularly if there has been vaginal or
anal penetration with pain, bleeding, or ejaculation. To limit painful procedures, some experts begin with genital, anal, and/or throat
testing and do the blood testing if the earlier testing is positive.
Because HIV testing identifies antibodies to the virus, it may take
several months for seroconversion—repeat testing at 6 weeks and 3
months after the last suspected exposure is indicated. Repeat testing for syphilis and hepatitis B is also recommended at the same
intervals.

INTERPRETATION OF FINDINGS

History: A clear disclosure of abuse by a child or adolescent, particularly with details that can be corroborated, is strong evidence that
abuse has occurred. A strong denial could indicate that abuse did
not occur, but could also be the result of fear, threats from the perpetrator, or pressure from family members to remain silent. Limited
language skills or a long length of time since the abuse occurred
may limit the specificity of the disclosure. Alternatively, a vague disclosure may lead a parent to assume abuse when none has occurred.
Infrequently, a child may be coached by a parent to describe abuse,
sometimes in the context of a custody dispute. More commonly, an
abusive parent will allege coaching to protect themself and enable
ongoing access to the child.
Findings indicative of trauma: Abrasions, lacerations, and bruising of the labia, vulva, penis, scrotum, perianal tissues, or perineum
indicate recent trauma. Hymenal bruising and lacerations and deep
perianal lacerations (vs superficial fissures) indicate penetrating
trauma. Anogenital scars indicate older trauma. Hymnal scars often
appear as changes in the usual anatomy and pallor. It is noteworthy
that such findings that are exactly midline are likely normal embryonic remnants. A complete transection of the hymen all the way to

the base below 3 and 9 o’clock in the supine position (i.e., absence
or gap of hymenal tissue posteriorly) is considered diagnostic for
penetrating trauma (see Fig. 17.10). For all these findings, the cause
of injury must be elucidated through the child and parent history, as
trauma may also be the result of a noninflicted injury or consensual
sexual activity. If there is any concern that the finding may be the
result of sexual abuse, CPS should be notified, and a medical evaluation should be performed by a medical specialist with expertise in
child sexual abuse.
STIs: A number of STIs raise serious concern for abuse (Table
17.7). In a prepubertal child, gonorrhea, trichomonas, or syphilis beyond the neonatal period indicates that the child had contact
with infected genital secretions, almost always as a result of sexual
abuse. There is some evidence to indicate that chlamydia in children up to 3 years of age may be perinatally acquired. Chlamydia
in children older than 3 years is diagnostic of contact with infected
genital secretions almost always because of abuse. HIV is diagnostic
for sexual abuse if other means of transmission have been excluded.
Because of the potential for human papillomavirus (HPV) transmission, either perinatally or through nonsexual contact, the presence
of genital warts has a low specificity for sexual abuse. Nevertheless,
the possibility of abuse should be briefly probed with the family,
especially in children whose warts first appear beyond 5 years of
age. Type 1 or 2 herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the anogenital area
is concerning for sexual abuse, but not diagnostic given other possible routes of transmission. PCPs should consider referring patients
with HPV and HSV to CPS.

Integration of Information

Because most sexually abused children have normal exams, it is often
not possible to make a diagnosis of sexual abuse by the exam alone.
Ideally, the determination of abuse should be made as part of a multidisciplinary team process, where information from interviews, medical evaluation, forensic kit, and laboratory test results are integrated.
Determinations by CPS as to whether abuse occurred may not align
directly with a decision to prosecute alleged offenders because criminal
cases require a higher level of proof (beyond a reasonable doubt) than
do CPS cases, which rely on the preponderance of evidence (i.e., more
likely than not).

Chapter 17 u Abused and Neglected Children
Recommendations for Children and Families

At the conclusion of the medical evaluation, the PCP should let the
child and parent know that the child is physically healthy but should
also explain to them why a normal exam does not rule out abuse. It
is often helpful to reinforce that in most cases, what is most important in determining whether sexual abuse occurred is what the child
has said. When there are findings indicative of abuse, these should
also be clearly explained. Of note, injuries to the anogenital area
typically heal without complications, and most STIs respond well to
treatment. Thus comforting and reassuring children and families is
generally appropriate, even when injuries and/or infection occurs.
PCPs should tell children that the abuse was not their fault and
encourage parents to be supportive of their child. Although most
children will not need medical follow-­up, a visit with their PCP
can be helpful to monitor psychosocial progress and to support the
child and family. Some will need repeat HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis
B testing. Hepatitis B and HPV vaccination (for children ≥9 years)
should be given if the child has not been adequately vaccinated.
Most children and their parents benefit from therapy or counseling.
A mental health evaluation for other children in the home should
be considered; the stress of coping with abuse and its ramifications
can be difficult for the entire family. Parents are often very stressed
by the sexual abuse of their child, even when it is uncertain what
happened. This is compounded by the legal processes and implications. If emotional or behavior problems arise later, the PCP should
try to refer the child to a mental health professional with experience
in addressing trauma.

SEXUAL ABUSE PREVENTION

PCPs can play a role in the prevention of sexual abuse by educating
parents and children about sexual safety at well-­child visits. During the
genital exam the PCP can inform the child that only the doctor and
select adult caregivers should be permitted to see their “private parts”
and that a trusted adult should be told if anyone else attempts to do
so. Parents and children should be encouraged to use correct terms
(vagina, vulva, penis, breasts) to demystify the genitals. The pediatrician can teach parents, children, and youth how to minimize the
opportunity for perpetrators to access children, for example, by limiting one-­adult/one-­child situations outside the home (e.g., in daycare or
school) and being sensitive to another adult’s unusual interest in young
children. In addition, PCPs can model for parents talking with children
about what to do if confronted with a potentially abusive situation.
Some examples include telling children to say “no,” to leave, and to tell
a parent and/or another trusted adult. Conversations with children of
all ages can include a discussion of consent before touching another
person. Conversations with teens can include information about statutory rape and electronic dissemination of sexual photos, along with
their risks. Finally, PCPs can encourage open communication between
parents and children; children need to hear that their parent is there to
protect them and will not be angry with them if they hear something
bad. Instead, they need to know.

17.2 Factitious Disorder ­Imposed on
Another: Medical Child Abuse
­(Munchausen ­Syndrome by Proxy)
Howard Dubowitz and Wendy G. Lane
Munchausen syndrome describes situations in which adults falsify
their own symptoms to obtain healthcare. In Munchausen syndrome
by proxy, a parent, typically a mother, simulates or causes signs
and/or symptoms in her child, resulting in unnecessary healthcare.
Several terms describing this phenomenon focus on the abuse or

127

neglect experienced by a child, including pediatric condition falsification, caregiver-­fabricated illness in a child, and medical child
abuse (MCA). Factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA) is
a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-­5) psychiatric diagnosis focused on the psychopathology
in the responsible parent attempting to meet their own psychologic
needs. FDIA may encompass all other titles. In some instances, such
as partial suffocation, “child abuse” may be most appropriate.
Because milder forms of MCA often go undetected, its incidence
is unclear, although 0.5-­2 per 100,000 children is commonly cited,
and it appears to be a global problem. The core dynamic is that a
parent falsely presents a child for healthcare. This may be via fabricating a history, such as reporting seizures or apnea that never
occurred. A parent may directly cause a child’s illness, for example,
by exposing a child to a toxin, medication, or infectious agent (e.g.,
injecting stool into an intravenous line) or smothering a child. Signs
or symptoms may also be manufactured, such as when a parent
withholds medication or alters laboratory samples or temperature
measurements. Parents may also withhold information about normal procedures or testing done elsewhere. Preverbal children are
usually involved, although older children may be convinced by parents that they have a particular problem and become dependent on
the increased attention; this may lead to feigning symptoms. They
may also be coached to corroborate false histories. Each of these
actions may lead clinicians to suspect a health problem and thus
to provide unnecessary healthcare, including intrusive tests and
surgeries.
When to suspect FDIA/MCA? Consideration of MCA may be
triggered when the described symptoms, their course, test results,
or response to standard treatment is incompatible with any known
disease or condition. The reported symptoms may be repeatedly
noted by only one parent or occur only when one caregiver is alone
with the child. Other risk indicators include parents who appear to
need a lot of attention from physicians or who insist that the child
cannot cope without them. They may refuse to leave the bedside
for days.
Parents with experience in a medical field may be adept at constructing plausible presentations, although the internet provides
other parents with easy access to medical information. A convincing
seizure history may be offered, as a normal electroencephalogram
cannot fully rule out the possibility of a seizure disorder. Even after
extensive testing fails to lead to a diagnosis or treatment proves ineffective, clinicians may think they are confronting a new or rare disease and may unwittingly contribute to unnecessary testing and to a
parent’s belief that a real problem exists. Efforts to carefully pursue
a diagnosis along with difficulty accepting uncertainty may lead clinicians to persist with testing. Clinicians generally rely on and trust
parents to provide an accurate history. As with other forms of child
maltreatment, accurate diagnosis of MCA requires that professionals maintain a healthy skepticism under certain circumstances; this
can be difficult. Clinicians, including mental health experts, may
think that they are skilled at detecting deception. Most do poorly
when attempting to do so during a clinical interview.
At a systems level, limited communication among treating professionals may delay the diagnosis of MCA. The “problems” often
recur repeatedly over several years. The time from first presentation until the diagnosis is made averages about 2 years. Ultimately, a
diagnosis of MCA rests on clear evidence of a child repeatedly being
subjected to unnecessary tests and treatment, primarily stemming
from a parent’s exaggeration, fabrication, or induction of symptoms
or signs suggesting an illness or condition.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Mothers are the most frequent perpetrators of MCA. They may
present as devoted or even model parents who form close relationships with members of the healthcare team. Although appearing very interested in their child’s condition, they may be distant
emotionally. Negative test results may meet with disappointment,
and they may insist on further evaluation. They may have a history

128 Part I u The Field of Pediatrics
of Munchausen syndrome, though not necessarily diagnosed as
such.
MCA varies in nature and severity. Males and females are equally
involved. Most of the victims are infants and toddlers, but approximately 25% of cases occur in children over 6 years of age. Siblings are
commonly affected. Approximately 6–9% of cases are fatal, with fatalities most often the result of poisoning or suffocation. It is important
to note that children who really do have health problems can also be
victims of MCA; up to 30% of patients with MCA have been found to
have a medical problem. Many medical or behavioral conditions can be
falsified. The following are examples of relatively common ways MCA
presents:
Bleeding may be caused by adding dyes to samples, adding
blood (e.g., from the mother) to the child’s sample, or giving the
child an anticoagulant (e.g., warfarin). Blood group testing may be
needed.
Seizures are easy to fabricate and difficult to rule out. A parent may report that another physician diagnosed seizures, and the
myth may be perpetuated if there is no effort to confirm the original
“diagnosis.” Alternatively, seizures may be induced by toxins, medications (e.g., insulin), water, or salt. Clinicians need to be familiar
with the substances available to families and their risks.
Apnea may be falsified or created by partial suffocation. A history
of a sibling with the same problem, perhaps dying from it, should raise
concern. Parents of children hospitalized for a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) have been videotaped attempting to suffocate
their child while in the hospital.
Gastrointestinal problems such as vomiting and diarrhea are common. Forced ingestion of medications such as ipecac may induce
chronic vomiting, or laxatives may cause diarrhea. Toxicology testing
is indicated in such circumstances.
Allergies may be fabricated. Sometimes, allergies may be diagnosed
or considered, and a parent persists in viewing this as a problem even
after it has subsequently been ruled out.
Urinary tract infections and hematuria account for about 25% of
cases.
Behavior problems such as self-­harm or harming others, learning
disabilities, hyperactivity, or autism may be falsely described.

EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS

It is critical that clinicians consider the possibility of MCA in their
differential diagnosis when facing the previously noted presentations. Further, it helps to focus on the actual or potential harm to
a child, rather than the parent’s possible motivation. Once MCA is
suspected, gathering and critically reviewing all the child’s medical
records from all sources is an onerous but critical first step, best
done by someone knowledgeable about MCA. Child protective
services (CPS) can help gather the records, and a hospital-­based
child protection team might be able to review the case. Important
documentation at each health contact includes date, location, reason for contact, reported signs/symptoms as stated by the caregiver,
objective observations documented by the physician, conclusions/
diagnosis made, treatment provided, effectiveness of treatment,
and other comments or observations. It is important to confer with
other treating physicians about what specifically was conveyed to
the family; they may have been reluctant to document concerns in
the child’s record. A parent may report that a certain test was done
at the insistence of a physician, when they, in fact, had demanded
it. It is also sometimes necessary to confirm the exact basis for a
given diagnosis, rather than simply accepting a parent’s account
(e.g., seizure).
Depending on the nature of the presenting problem, hospitalization may be needed. Verbal children should be interviewed alone,
and the family history should probe for unusual and frequent illnesses. Close observation of a child can be valuable. There may be

a history of poor appetite and vomiting, yet the child is observed to
eat well without problems. Symptoms may only be described when
the parent is present and otherwise noted to be absent. In some
instances, such as BRUEs, covert video surveillance accompanied
by monitoring (to rapidly intervene if a parent attempts to suffocate
a child) can be valuable. In addition to helping clarify the diagnosis,
video surveillance can identify a true medical problem. It is prudent
to consult with risk management and hospital legal staff before initiating surveillance. Specimens should be carefully collected, with
no opportunity for tampering with them. Similarly, temperature
measurements should be closely observed.
Coordination among treating professionals is essential, especially
as some may side with the parent and resent even the possibility of
MCA being raised. Ideally, parents should not be informed of the
evaluation for MCA until the diagnosis is made. Doing so could
influence their behavior and jeopardize establishing the diagnosis. In summarizing the review of health records and gathering
additional information, careful and chronologic documentation is
important. This includes who witnessed symptoms, direct information from other clinicians who made diagnoses, what guidance was
given to the family, whether a parent insisted on testing or treatment, and suspected tampering with equipment or records as well
as other concerning behavior. It may be necessary to block parents
at least temporarily from accessing part of the electronic health
record.
The diagnosis of MCA hinges on a child receiving unnecessary
healthcare that is actually or potentially harmful and that is instigated
by a parent or caregiver. Three questions to be answered in considering
MCA include:
1.	Are the history, signs, and symptoms credible?
2.	Is the child receiving unnecessary and harmful or potentially harmful medical care?
3.	If so, who is instigating the evaluations or treatments?
Comprehensive practice guidelines regarding MCA are available
from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American
Professional Society on the Abuse of Children (APSAC). In addition,
consultation with a board-­certified child abuse pediatrician is strongly
recommended.
Related circumstances: In assessing possible MCA, several other
circumstances should be considered in addition to a true health
problem. Some parents may be extremely anxious and genuinely
concerned about a possible problem. There may be many reasons
underpinning the vulnerable child syndrome, such as the death of
neighbor’s child or something read on the internet. Alternatively,
parents may believe something told to them by a trusted clinician
despite subsequent evidence to the contrary and efforts to correct
the earlier misdiagnosis (e.g., persistent belief that the child has
multiple food allergies). Secondary gain, such as qualifying for a
disability benefit, may be the impetus for malingering. A child’s
anxiety, especially in the context of complex medical conditions,
may lead to psychosomatic symptoms and consideration of MCA.
In addition, parents of such children may be extremely stressed, and
this may contribute to an approach that is overly medicalized (e.g.,
reluctance to wean a child off medication). There is also a need to
discern commonly used hyperbole (e.g., exaggerating the height of
a fever) to evoke concern and perhaps justify a clinic visit. Whatever
the possible underlying dynamics, children who receive unnecessary healthcare as a result of parental actions can be diagnosed with
MCA.

TREATMENT

MCA is a form of child abuse or neglect and needs to be referred
to CPS even when one is less than certain of the diagnosis; law
enforcement may also need to be involved. CPS staff often lack
knowledge of and experience with MCA and may need to be educated regarding this condition. Once the diagnosis of MCA is

established, the medical team and CPS should determine the treatment and safety plan, which may require out-­of-­home placement
and should include mental healthcare for the offending parent; psychiatric decompensation and maternal suicide have been reported.
Further medical care should be carefully coordinated through one
primary care professional. CPS should be encouraged to meet with
the family only after the medical team has informed the offending
parent of the diagnosis, together with the other parent or another
supportive adult if possible. Direct CPS involvement with the family during the assessment may jeopardize clarifying the diagnosis.
If the plan is to place the child out-­of-­home, it is optimal that CPS
plan the necessary steps in advance. Parents often respond with
resistance, denial, and threats. It may be prudent to have hospital
security in the vicinity in case of physical aggression or an attempt
to remove the child from the hospital against medical advice.
CPS should assess the safety of other children in the home. All family members may be affected by an MCA diagnosis; mental healthcare is recommended specifically for the parent involved with FDIA.
Assessing and addressing MCA can be time intensive and challenging. Clinicians may face the dilemma of when to accept that
all plausible diagnoses have been reasonably ruled out, the circumstances fit MCA, and when testing and treatment should cease. The
likelihood of MCA must be balanced with concerns about possibly
missing an important diagnosis. Consultation with a child abuse
pediatrician is recommended for making the diagnosis and for
helping plan ongoing healthcare if the child remains in or returns
to the home. Good communication among treating clinicians is
needed to adequately monitor the situation; long-­term monitoring
may be needed.

OUTCOMES

There may be lasting physical harms associated with unnecessary
and sometimes invasive evaluations and interventions, including
scarring, surgical complications, brain damage, and death. There
are also potentially serious and lasting social and psychologic
sequelae as a result of missing school and extracurricular activities and viewing themselves as disabled. Victims of MCA may be
overly compliant or aggressive and may develop poor self-­esteem,
posttraumatic stress disorder, and eating problems. Indirectly, other
family members and friends, professionals, and even community
members may be affected. Recidivism has been reported in 17–50%
of cases. Successful treatment of the abusive parent appears rare and
hinges on acknowledging their role and being willing and able to
change their behavior.

Strategies for Health
Behavior Change
Cori M. Green
To improve the health of children, pediatricians often ask patients
and caregivers to make behavioral changes. These may be lifestyle
changes to manage a chronic condition (e.g., obesity, asthma),
adherence with the recommended timing and frequency of medications, or recommendations to seek assistance from other health
providers (e.g., dieticians; mental health providers; physical,

129

occupational, or speech therapists). However, change is difficult
and can cause distress, and families often express reluctance or
ambivalence to change because of perceived barriers. When families do not believe change is needed or possible, pediatricians may
become discouraged or uncomfortable in providing care. This can
make it difficult for clinicians to form an alliance with families,
which is central to finding a solution to most problems identified in
the medical setting.
Many healthcare problems may require complex, multifaceted
interventions, but the first step is always to engage the family in
identifying the healthcare problem driving the need for behavior
change. Once a problem is identified and agreed on, clinicians
and families need to set an achievable goal and identify specific
behaviors that can help families reach their goal. It is important to
be specific and precise about the actual behavior and not simply
identify the category of the behavior. When counseling a patient
on weight loss for obesity, for example, one might discuss three
possible approaches: making dietary changes, increasing exercise,
and decreasing screen time. The choice of which behavior to focus
on should come from the patient but needs to be specific. It is not
enough for the patient to state he or she will exercise more. Instead,
the clinician should help the patient identify a more specific goal,
such as playing basketball with friends 3 times a week at the park
near home. This takes into account the action, context, setting, and
time of the new behavioral goal. Specific examples of problems that
would necessitate a behavior change to improve outcomes are used
throughout the chapter.

UNIFIED THEORY OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE

There are several theories of health-­related behavior change. Each
highlights a different concept, but frameworks that unite these theories
suggest that the factor most predictive of whether one will perform
a behavior is the intention to do so. The unified theory of behavior
change examines behavior along two dimensions: influences on intent
and moderators of the intention-­behavior relationship (Fig. 18.1). Five
main factors that influence one’s decision to perform a behavior are
expectancies, social norms/normative influences, self-­
concept/self-­
image, emotions, and self-­efficacy. Table 18.1 provides specific examples on how to explore influences of intent when guiding families in
decision-­making, such as deciding to start a stimulant medication for a
child diagnosed with attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
It is not necessary to ask about each influence, but these principles are
particularly useful when guiding patients who may be resistant to
change.
Once a decision to make a change is made, four factors determine
whether an intention leads to carrying out the behavior: knowledge
and skills, environmental facilitators and constraints, salience of
the behavior, and habits. The pediatrician can help ensure intent
leads to behavior change by addressing these factors during the
visit. In the ADHD example, the clinician can help the family build
their knowledge by providing handouts on stimulants, nutritional
pamphlets on how to minimize the appetite-­suppressant effects of
the medication on weight, and information on how the family can
explain to others the need for medication. Asking about morning
routines will help identify potential barriers in remembering to take
the medication. Lastly, clinicians can help families think about cues
for remembering to give the medication in the morning, because
their morning routines, or habits, will have to be adjusted to adhere
to this medication.
By using these principles of behavior change, clinicians can guide
their patients toward change during an encounter by ensuring they
leave with (1) a strong positive intention to perform the behavior;
(2) the perception that they have the skills to accomplish it; (3) a
belief that the behavior is socially acceptable and consistent with
their self-­image; (4) a positive feeling about the behavior; (5) specific strategies in overcoming potential barriers in performing the
behavior; and (6) a set of identified cues and enablers to help build
new habits.

clinician can then help the patient decide which behavior can help them meet the health goal. Once this is decided, to help with behavior change,
clinicians should think about intent, influences of intent, and the factors that may facilitate or impede intent from leading to action.

­INFLUENCES OF INTENT

POSSIBLE FACTORS INFLUENCING THE
­DECISION*

Beliefs and expectancies
Perceived advantages and
disadvantages of performing a
behavior.

Ask questions about their beliefs and experiences.
“What do you know already know about stimulants?”
“Have you heard about other children’s experiences
taking stimulants?”
“What do you expect will happen if your child takes a
stimulant?”
Ask permission to give information addressing their
prior beliefs or experiences.
“Is it all right if I give you some information addressing
your concerns?”

“I know that stimulants helped my nephew do
better in school.”
“I heard stimulants stunt children’s growth.”

Social norms
Pressures to (or not) perform a
behavior because of what is
standard among social groups.

Share information about the normative nature of the
behavior and ways to cope if performing a behavior
that is not the social norm.
“I have a lot of patients who have improved in school
after starting a stimulant.”

“Do other parents give their children stimulants if
they are diagnosed with ADHD?”
“What would my mother think if she found out my
child was taking a stimulant?”

Self-­concept/self-­image
Overall sense of self and whether
behavior is congruent with that
and with the image they want
to project to others.

Interact with family in a partnering, supportive,
respectful manner. Identify strengths. Reframe any
negative images they foresee may happen with the
behavior.
“I am sure your in-­laws will be so happy when your child
is doing better in school.”

“Am I a good parent if I give my child medications
that affect their brain?”
“What will other parents at school think if I allow
my child to start a stimulant? What will my
in-­laws think?”

Emotions
Emotional reactions to
performing behaviors in terms
of intensity and direction
(positive or negative).

Allow patients to express their feelings. Suggest ways to
manage negative or avoidant feelings.
“Many parents are scared to start stimulants at first.
However, once their child is succeeding in school, they
realize the benefits outweighed the risks. Let’s talk
more about your fears.”

“I am so nervous about my child starting to take a
stimulant.”
“I am so upset with how my child is doing in
school and really do not know what to do next.”
“I am so relieved that there is a medication that
may help improve my child’s grades and chance
of going to college.”

Self-­efficacy
Perceived confidence they can
perform the behavior.

Provide information, model the behavior, encourage
success, and teach skills. Explore what obstacles they
foresee and how confident they are they can overcome
obstacles. Help strategize ways to overcome obstacles.
“Do you feel confident you will be able to get your child
to take the medication?”
“Let’s brainstorm how we can prevent any of the side
effects.”
“Many of my patients have a large breakfast before
taking the medication. Can I help you figure out how
to fit that into your schedule?”

“Will I be able to remember to give my child this
medication every day?”
“Will I be able to make sure my child has a large
breakfast in the morning before taking the
medication?”

ADHD, Attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder.

Table 18.2  Stages of Change and Strategies for Counseling*
STAGE/DEFINITION

GOAL AND STRATEGY

SPECIFIC EXAMPLES

Precontemplation
Not considering change.
May be unaware that a
problem exists.

Establish a therapeutic
relationship.
Increase awareness of need to
change.

“I understand you are only here because your parents are worried and
that you don’t feel that smoking marijuana is a big deal.”
“Can I ask if smoking marijuana has created any problems for you now?
I know your parents were worried about your grades.”
“It’s up to you to decide if and when you are ready to cut back on
smoking marijuana.”
“Is it okay if I give you some information about marijuana use?”
“I know it can be hard to change a habit when you feel under pressure.
It is totally up to you to decide if cutting back is right for you. Is it okay
if I ask you about this during our next visit?”

Contemplation
Beginning to consider making
a change, but still feeling
ambivalent about making a
change.

Identify ambivalence.
Help develop discrepancy
between goals and current
behaviors.
Ask about pros and cons of
changing problem behavior.
Support patient toward making a
change.

“I’m hearing that you do agree that sometimes your marijuana use does
get in the way, especially with school. However, it helps relax you and
it would be hard to make a change right now.”
“What would be one benefit of cutting back? What would be a
drawback to cutting back? Do you think your smoking will cause
problems in the future?”
“After talking about this, if you feel you want to cut back, the next step
would be to think about how to best do that. We wouldn’t need to
jump right into a plan. Why don’t you think about what we discussed,
and we can meet next week if you are ready to make a plan?”

Preparation
Preparing for action.
Reduced ambivalence and
exploration of options for
change.

Help patient set a goal and
prepare a concrete plan.
Offer a menu of choices.
Identify supports and barriers.

“It’s great that you are thinking about ways to cut back on your
smoking. I understand your initial goal is to stop smoking during the
week.”
“I can give you some other options of how to relax and reduce stress
during the week.”
“We need to figure out how to react to your friends after school who
you normally smoke with.”
“Do you have other friends who you can see after school instead, who
would support this decision?”

Action
Taking action; actively
implementing plan.

Provide positive feedback.
Identify unexpected barriers and
create coping strategies.

“Congratulations on cutting back. Have you noticed any differences in
your schoolwork? I’m so happy to hear your grades improved.”
“Has it been difficult to not see your friends after school? How have you
reacted when they get annoyed you don’t want to smoke with them?”
“Let’s continue to track your progress.”

Maintenance
Continues to change behavior
and maintains healthier lifestyle.

Reinforce commitment and affirm
ability to change.
Create coping plans when relapse
does occur.
Manage triggers.

“You really are committed to going to a good college and improving
your grades. I’m so happy the hard work has paid off.”
“I understand that it was hard to say no to smoking with your friends
last week when it was someone’s birthday. How did you feel after? Are
there triggers that we can think about preventing in the future?”

TRANSTHEORETICAL MODEL OF HEALTH
­ EHAVIOR CHANGE
B

It is difficult to counsel families to change a behavior when they
may not agree there is a problem or when they are not ready to
build an intention to change. The transtheoretical model of health
behavior change places an individual’s motivation and readiness to
change on a continuum. The premise of this model is that behavior
change is a process, and as someone attempts to change, they move
through five stages (although not always in a linear fashion): precontemplation (no current intention of making a change), contemplation (considering change), preparation (creating an intention,
planning, and committing to change), action (has changed behavior
for a short time), and maintenance (sustaining long-­term change).
Assessing a patient’s stage of change and then targeting counseling
toward that stage can help build a therapeutic alliance, in contrast
to counseling a patient to do something she or he is not ready for,
which can disrupt the therapeutic alliance and lead to resistance.
Table 18.2 further describes stages of change and gives examples for
counseling that target the adolescent’s stage of change in reducing
marijuana smoking.

COMMON FACTORS APPROACH

Conversations around behavior change are most effective when they
take place in a context of a trusting, mutually respectful relationship.
The traditional medical model assumes that patients and their families come with questions and needs and that the pediatrician’s job is to
offer specific advice and advocate for its acceptance. This approach fails
when families are reluctant, ambivalent, demoralized, or unfamiliar
with the healthcare system or the treatment choices offered. A context
more supportive of behavior change can be developed when clinicians
use communication strategies that facilitate collaboration and building
a therapeutic alliance.
The common factors approach is an evidence-­based communication strategy that is effective in facilitating behavior change. The skills
central to a common factors approach are consistent across multiple
forms of psychotherapy and therefore can be considered transdiagnostic. Common factors and processes can be viewed as generic aspects of
treatment that can be used across a wide range of symptoms to build
a therapeutic alliance between the physician and patient. This alliance
predicts outcomes of counseling more than the specific modality of
treatment. The common factors approach has been implemented and

SKILL

EXAMPLES

Hope for improvement:
Develop strengths.

“I have seen other children like you
with similar feelings of sadness,
and they have gotten better.”

Empathy: Listen attentively.

“It must be hard for you that you
no longer get pleasure in playing
soccer.”

Language: Use family’s
language. Check
understanding.

“Let me make sure I understand
what you are saying. You no longer
feel like doing things that made
you happy in the past?”

Loyalty: Express support
and commitment.

“You are free to talk to me about
anything while we work through
this.”

Permission: Ask permission
to explore sensitive
subjects. Offer advice.

“I would like to ask more questions
that you may find more sensitive, is
that okay?”
“Is it okay with you if I give you
my opinion on what may be the
problem here?”

Partnership: Identify and
overcome barriers.

Plan: Establish a plan, or at
least a first step the family
can take.

“Can we discuss together possible
solutions to overcoming your
discomfort in getting therapy?”
“If we work together, maybe we can
think through solutions for the
problems you identified.”

*This table illustrates the interpersonal skills highlighted in the common factors
approach. In this example the clinician is responding to an adolescent struggling with
depression and resistant to seeking help.
Adapted with data from Foy JM, Kelleher KJ, Laraque D. American Academy of

studied in pediatric primary care for children with mental health problems. Children who were treated by pediatricians trained in the common factors approach had improved functioning compared to those
who saw pediatricians without this training.
A common factors approach distinguishes between the impact of the
patient-­provider alliance and the pediatrician’s use of skills that influence patient behavior change across a broad range of conditions. Interpersonal skills that help build alliances with patients include showing
empathy, warmth, and positive regard. Skills that influence behavior change include a clinician’s ability to provide optimism, facilitate
treatment engagement, and maintain the focus on achievable goals.
This can be done by clearly explaining the condition and treatment
approaches while keeping the discussion focused on immediate and
practical concerns.

Interpersonal Skills: HEL2P3

The interpersonal skills that facilitate an effective bond between the
patient and clinician can be remembered by the HEL2P3 mnemonic
(Table 18.3). These skills include providing hope, empathy, and loyalty; using the patient’s language; partnering with the family; asking
permission to raise more sensitive questions or to give advice; and creating a plan that is initiated by the family. These interpersonal skills
should help operationalize the common factors approach by increasing
a patient’s optimism, feelings of well-­being, and willingness to work
toward improved health, while also targeting feelings of anger, ambivalence, and hopelessness.

Structuring a patient encounter using common factors to facilitate behavior change uses these steps: eliciting concerns while
setting an agenda and agreeing on the nature of the problem; establishing a plan; and responding to anger and demoralization and
emphasizing hope.

Elicit Concerns: Set the Agenda and Agree on the
Problem

The first step of the visit is to elicit both the child’s and the parent’s
concerns and agree on the focus for the visit. This can be accomplished by using open-­ended questions and asking “anything else?”
until nothing else is disclosed. It is important to show you have
time and are interested in their concerns by making eye contact,
listening attentively, minimizing distractions, and responding with
empathy and interest. Engage both the child and the parent by taking turns eliciting their concerns. It is helpful to summarize their
story to reassure them you have heard and understand what they
are saying. Keep the session organized, and manage rambling by
gently interrupting, paraphrasing, asking for additional concerns,
and refocusing the conversation. These same principles apply for
telehealth visits. Make sure you are looking into the camera and use
exaggerated responses. It is particularly helpful to frequently summarize the child’s and parents’ concerns, voice observations, and
use reflective statements during telehealth visits so the family does
see that you are listening to them.
By the end of this step in the visit, all parties should feel reassured
that their problems were heard and accurately described. The next step
is to agree on the problem to be addressed during that visit. If the parent and child do not agree on the issue, try to find a common thread
that will address the concerns of both.

Establish a Plan

Once a problem is agreed on, the clinician can partner with families to
develop acceptable and achievable plans for treatment or further evaluation. Families should take the lead in developing goals and the strategies
to attain them, and information should be given in response to patients’
expressed needs. Pediatricians can involve families by offering choices
and asking for feedback. Advice should be given only after asking a family’s permission to do so. If the family asks for advice, the clinician should
respond by considering principles of behavior change, as described earlier. Advice should be tailored toward the family’s willingness to act, concerns for barriers, and attitudes and should be as specific and practical as
possible. Once an initial plan is established, it is important to partner in
monitoring responses and to provide continued support.

Respond to Anger and Demoralization and
Emphasize Hope

The common factors approach is particularly helpful in engaging
families in situations where anger and demoralization could prevent
patients from being able to use the clinician’s advice. Focusing the conversation on goals for the future and how to achieve them is more productive than discussing how problems began. This “solution-­focused
therapy” approach grew out of the need for clinicians to help people in
a brief encounter. Hopelessness can be relieved by pediatricians helping patients to identify and build on strengths and past success, reframing events and feelings, and breaking down overwhelming goals into
small, concrete steps that are more readily accomplished. In general,
pediatricians can use the elicit-­provide-­elicit model. After eliciting a
concern or hearing about patients’ goals, ask if they want to hear your
thoughts about the situation. Provide guidance in a neutral way, and
then ask the family what they think about what you just stated.
Table 18.4 provides an example of how to use common factors in
practice using a scenario of an adolescent female who has been teased
for using albuterol before physical education class for her exercise-­
induced asthma. The clinician in the scenario attempts to address both
the patient’s and her mother’s concerns.

treatment.

Increase expectations that
treatment will be helpful.

EXAMPLES

Use open-­ended questions
and ask, “What else?” until
nothing else is listed, while
engaging both parties and
demonstrating empathy.

“Hi, Jacqueline and Mrs. Smith. How have things been since last time? What
are your biggest concerns for today?”
“What else do you think we should put on the agenda for today?”
“I am sorry to hear that you have had more asthma symptoms around gym
time, Jacqueline. I’d like to ask you a few more questions to get a better
understanding of what has changed, if that’s okay with you.”
“I understand this is upsetting you, Mrs. Smith, and that you worry that
Jacqueline is not going to the nurse before gym to use her inhaler pump
anymore. Let’s hear from Jacqueline.”

Agree on the problem.

“Can we all agree that managing the asthma symptoms around gym time is
the most pressing issue for today? Should we focus on that today?”

Manage rambling.

“What you’re saying is really important, but I want to be sure we have time to
talk about controlling your daughter’s asthma symptoms during gym. Is it
okay if we go back to that topic?”

Develop acceptable plans
for treatment of further
diagnoses.

“I believe we can develop a plan to help deal with this. Is it okay to start
talking about next steps?”
“I am happy to give suggestions on how to more easily use your inhaler
before gym, without the other kids noticing. But what were you thinking,
Jacqueline?”
“Let’s brainstorm how you would respond to your classmates if they see you
using your inhaler.”

Address barriers to treatment.

“Is there anything that makes you worry that this may not work?”

Respond to hopelessness, anger,
and frustration.

“I realize it wasn’t your choice to come here, Jacqueline, but I’m interested in
hearing how you feel about this issue.”
“It must be really hard for you, Jacqueline, when the kids tease you about
your inhaler. Discussing this with your mom and me was very brave, and now
we can help you.”
“It must be frustrating for the school nurse to call you in the middle of the day
at work, Mrs. Smith.”
“I would be angry, too, if I felt my mom didn’t understand how it felt when I
got teased for going to the nurse’s office.”

Emphasize hope.

“We’ve managed difficult things before. Remember when Jacqueline kept
getting admitted for her asthma when she was younger? We have come a
long way since then, and I’m sure we can manage this as well.”

*Jacqueline is an adolescent female who has had asthma since she was an infant. Despite multiple hospitalizations as an infant, her asthma had been under control except for during
exercise, including physical education (PE) class. She had been going to the nurse’s office to take albuterol before PE class, but recently she had been teased for having to take
medication before PE. She has begun to skip treatments to avoid the teasing. However, her mother has now been called a few times to pick her up from school because of her
asthma symptoms. Jacqueline’s caregiver is a single parent who cannot miss work and is very frustrated. She was not aware of the bullying Jacqueline has undergone.

MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING
Motivational interviewing (MI) is a goal-­oriented, supportive counseling style that complements the HEL2P3 framework and is useful when
patients or families remain ambivalent about making health-­related
behavior changes. MI is designed to enhance intrinsic motivation in
patients by exploring their perspectives and ambivalence. It is also
aligned with the transtheoretical model’s continuum of change, where
the clinician not only tailors counseling to a patient’s stage of change
but does so with the goal of moving the patient toward the next stage.
It is particularly effective for those not interested in change or not
ready to make a commitment. MI has been shown to be an effective
intervention strategy for decreasing high-­risk behaviors, improving
chronic disease control, and increasing adherence to preventive health
measures.
MI is a collaborative approach in which the pediatrician respects
patients’ perspectives and treats them as the “expert” on their values,
beliefs, and goals. Collaboration, acceptance, compassion, and evocation are the foundation of MI and are referred to as the “spirit” of the
approach. The clinician is a “guide,” respecting patients’ autonomy

and their ability to make their own decision to change. The pediatrician expresses genuine concern and demonstrates that he or she
understands and validates the patient’s or family’s struggle. Using
open-­
ended questions, the pediatrician evokes the patient’s own
motivation for change.
Expressing empathy facilitates behavior change by accepting the
patient’s beliefs and behaviors. This contrasts with direct persuasion,
which often leads to resistance. The pediatrician must reinforce that
ambivalence is normal and use skillful reflective listening, showing the
patient an understanding of the situation.
Developing a discrepancy between current behaviors (or treatment
choices) and treatment goals motivates change and helps move the
patient from the precontemplative stage to the contemplative stage
or from the contemplative stage to preparation, as described in the
transtheoretical model. Through MI the clinician can guide patients in
understanding that their current behaviors may not be consistent with
their stated goals and values.
Rolling with resistance, or not pushing back when suggestions are
declined, is a strategy again to align with the patient. Resistance is

Open-­ended questions

“Now that we have finished the majority of the visit, I’d like to talk about your weight. Is that okay?
How do you feel about your size?”
“How do you feel about Jimmy’s weight?” (directed toward caregiver)

Affirmations

“You definitely have shown how strong you are having dealt with kids teasing you about your size.”
“Remember when you were having difficulties with your schoolwork? You were able to make a few
changes, and now you are doing well. I am confident we can do the same with your weight.”

Reflective listening

“You are feeling like your son is the same size as everyone in your family, and you aren’t concerned
right now.”
“I hear that as a working parent, watching TV before bed really works for your family.”
“You’re not terribly excited about having to think of ways to cook differently.”

Summary statements

“So far, we have discussed how challenging it would be to lose weight and make changes for the
whole family, but you are willing to consider some simple changes.”

Focusing

Set the agenda.

“We could talk about increasing the amount of exercise Jimmy has every week, reducing screen time,
or making a dietary change. What do you think would work best?”
“Great, so we will talk about soda. What do you like about it? How many times a week do you drink it?”

Evocation

Reinforce any change
talk.
Change ruler.

“Those are great reasons for thinking about cutting back on soda.”
“On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you (or how important is it) that you can cut back on soda?”
“A 5. Why didn’t you answer a 3?”
“What would it take to bring it to a 7?”

Planning

Focus on how to make
the change, not “why”
anymore.
Be concrete.

“Maybe completely eliminating soda is too difficult right now. Do you want to think of a couple of
times during the week where you can reward yourself with a soda?”
“What will you drink after school instead of soda?”

usually a sign that a different approach is needed. As necessary, the
clinician can ask permission to give new perspectives.
Self-­efficacy, or a patient’s belief in her or his ability to perform the
behavior, is a key element for change and a powerful motivator. Clinicians can express confidence in the patient’s ability to achieve change
and support the patient’s self-­efficacy.
The process by which MI is used in a patient encounter involves the
following four parts:
1.	Engagement is the rapport-­building part of the encounter. In addition to using the skills presented in the HEL2P3 framework, the MI
approach highlights the use of open-­ended questions, affirmations,
reflective listening, and summaries (OARS). Open-­ended questions
should be inviting and probing, enabling the patient to think through
and come to a better understanding of the problem and elicit their
internal motivation. Affirmations provide positive feedback, express
appreciation about a patient’s strengths, and can reinforce autonomy
and self-­efficacy. Reflective listening demonstrates that the clinician
understands the patient’s thoughts and feelings without judgement or
interruption. It should be done frequently and can encourage the patient to be more open. Summarizing the conversation in a succinct way
reinforces that you are listening, pulls together all information, and allows the patient to hear his or her own motivations and ambivalence.
2.	Focusing the visit is done to clarify the patient’s priorities and stage
of readiness and to identify the problem where there is ambivalence.
If a patient remains resistant to change, ask permission to give information or share ideas and then ask for feedback on what they think
about what you said. In the elicit-­ask-­elicit model, a clinician can
deliver information about an unhealthy behavior or lifestyle decision
in a nonpaternalistic manner.
3.	Evocation is when the clinician assesses their patients’ reasons for
change and helps them to explore advantages, disadvantages, and
barriers to change. It is important to reinforce the patient’s change

talk. Examples of change talk include an expression of desire (“I
want to…”), ability (“I can…”), reasons (“There are good reasons
to…”), or a need for change (“I need to…”). Clinicians can use
“readiness rulers” by asking their patients to rate on a scale from
1 to 10 how important and confident they are in making a change.
The clinician should then respond by asking why the patient did
not choose a lower number and should follow up by asking what it
would take to bring it to a higher number.
4.	The planning stage is similar to that described in the discussion of a
common factors approach and occurs once a patient is in the preparation stage on the continuum of change. A clinician can guide
their patient through this stage by having them write down responses to statements such as, “The changes I want to make are…,”
“The most important reasons to make this change are…,” “Some
people who can support me are…,” and “They can help me by….”
A concrete plan should include specific actions and a way to factor
in accountability and rewards. Table 18.5 uses a visit for counseling
about obesity to demonstrate the process of MI.

SHARED DECISION-­MAKING

Shared decision-­making (SDM) has many similarities to the processes
previously described in that it emphasizes moving clinicians away
from a paternalistic approach in dictating treatment to one where
patients and clinicians collaborate in making a medical decision, particularly when multiple evidence-­based treatment options exist. The
overall goal is to approach medical decisions using patient-­centered
strategies that are based on the best evidence available while aligning
with family values. By definition, (1) SDM must involve two parties
(clinician and patient/family); (2) information must be exchanged
in both directions; (3) both parties must be aware of all treatment
options; and (4) the clinician and patient/family must both bring
their own knowledge and values equally into the decision-­making

process. This approach is only possible when there is more than one
management strategy and SDM does not put a patient at risk.
SDM is often facilitated by using evidence-­based decision aids such
as pamphlets, videos, web-­based tools, or educational workshops.
Condition-­specific or more generic decision aids have been created
and facilitate the process of SDM. Studies in adults show that such
aids improve knowledge and satisfaction, reduce decisional conflict,
and increase the alignment between patient preferences and treatment options. Although SDM is widely used and has been studied in

135

adult populations, it is more complicated in pediatric settings because
the caregiver (a surrogate for the patient) is also involved in decision-­
making. It important to involve the child or adolescent in SDM, as
the more they are involved in SDM, the better their outcomes may
be. Options must be explained in a developmentally appropriate
way. Then both the parent and clinician need to assess how much the
patient truly understands regarding their stated preference.

Growth, Development, and
Behavior
Chapter 19

Developmental and
Behavioral Theories
Margo Candelaria and Susan Feigelman
The field of pediatrics is dedicated to optimizing the growth and
development of each child. Pediatricians require knowledge of normal growth, development, and behavior to effectively monitor children’s progress, identify delays or abnormalities in development, help
obtain needed services, and counsel parents and caretakers. To alter
factors that increase or decrease risk and resilience, pediatricians need
to understand how biologic and social forces interact within the parent–child relationship, within the family, and between the family and
the larger society. Growth is an indicator of overall well-­being, status of
chronic disease, and interpersonal and psychologic stress. By monitoring children and families over time, pediatricians are uniquely situated
to observe the interrelationships between physical growth and cognitive, motor, and emotional development. Observation is enhanced by
familiarity with developmental and behavioral theories that inform
one about typical patterns of development and provide guidance for
prevention or intervention for behavior problems. Familiarity with
theories of health behavior may assist clinicians in guiding patients and
families in disease management and wellness care.

BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL MODEL AND
­ COBIODEVELOPMENTAL FRAMEWORK:
E
MODELS OF DEVELOPMENT

The medical model presumes that a patient presents with signs and
symptoms and a physician focuses on diagnosing and treating diseases
of the body. This model neglects the social and psychologic aspect of a
person who exists in the larger realm of the family and society. In the
biopsychosocial model, societal and community systems are simultaneously considered along with more proximal systems that make up
the person and the person’s environment (Fig. 19.1). A patient’s symptoms are examined and explained in the context of the patient’s existence. This multidimensional model can be used to understand health
and both acute and chronic disease, and this model has been increasingly used to develop care models over the past few decades.
With the advances in neurology, genomics (including epigenetics),
molecular biology, and the social sciences, a broader model, the ecobiodevelopmental framework, has emerged. This framework emphasizes how the ecology of childhood (social and physical environments)
interacts with biologic processes to determine outcomes and life trajectories. Early influences, particularly those producing toxic levels of
stress, affect the individual through their impact on the body’s stress
response systems, brain development, and modification of gene expression. Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, may be influenced by early life experiences (the environment) and
impact gene expression without changing the DNA sequence. These
changes can produce long-­lasting effects on the health and well-­being
of the individual and may be passed on to future generations (Fig. 19.2).
Critical to learning and remembering (and therefore development)
is neuronal plasticity, which permits the central nervous system to
reorganize neuronal networks in response to environmental stimulation, both positive and negative. An overproduction of neuronal precursors eventually leads to about 100 billion neurons in the adult brain.

PART

II

Each neuron develops on average 15,000 synapses by 3 years of age. During early childhood, synapses in frequently used pathways are preserved,
whereas less-­used ones atrophy, a process termed pruning. Changes in the
strength and number of synapses and reorganization of neuronal circuits
also play important roles in brain plasticity. Increases or decreases in synaptic activity result in persistent increases or decreases in synaptic strength.
Thus experience (environment) has a direct effect on the physical and
therefore functional properties of the brain. Children with different talents
and temperaments (already a combination of genetics and environment)
further elicit different stimuli from their varying environments.
Periods of rapid development generally correlate with periods
of great changes in synaptic numbers in relevant areas of the brain.
Accordingly, sensory deprivation during the time when synaptic
changes should be occurring has profound effects. The effects of strabismus leading to amblyopia occur quickly during early childhood;
patching the eye with good vision to reverse amblyopia is less effective
in late childhood (see Chapter 663). Early experience is particularly
important because learning proceeds more efficiently along established
synaptic pathways. However, some plasticity of the brain continues into
adolescence, with further development of the prefrontal cortex, which
is important in decision-­making, future planning, and emotional control; neurogenesis persists in adulthood in certain areas of the brain.
Early traumatic experiences modify the expression of stress mediators (in particular the hypothalamic-­pituitary-­adrenal axis) and neurotransmitters, leading to changes in brain connectivity and function.
These effects may be persistent, leading to alterations and dysfunction in the stress response throughout life. Chronic stress has negative
effects on cognitive functions, including memory and emotional regulation. Positive and negative experiences do not determine the ultimate
outcome but shift the probabilities by influencing the child’s ability to
respond adaptively to future stimuli.
There is increasing evidence that positive experiences and relationships can buffer the impact of negative or traumatic experience and
toxic stress. In fact, there is a recent call for pediatrics to recognize and
promote relational health as a protective factor. By promoting positive
relationships, labeled safe, stable, and nurturing relationships (SSNRs)
within primary care, healthcare providers can work with families to
build relational health, thereby combatting the deleterious effects of
toxic stress and promoting resilience. Pediatric care can do this by
employing a public health approach, partnering with families and communities, to build healthy relationships by connecting to and integrating with primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention programs. This
can include embedding interventions within primary care and creating
robust referral networks to connect families to needed services.

Biologic Influences

Biologic influences on development include genetics, in utero exposure
to teratogens, the long-­term negative effects of low birthweight (neonatal
morbidities plus increased rates of subsequent adult-­onset obesity, coronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes), postnatal
illnesses, exposure to hazardous substances, and maturation. Adoption
and twin studies consistently show that heredity accounts for approximately 40% of the variance in IQ and in other personality traits, such as
sociability and desire for novelty, whereas shared environment accounts
for another 50%. The negative effects on development of prenatal exposure to teratogens, such as mercury and alcohol, and of postnatal insults,
such as meningitis and traumatic brain injury, have been extensively studied (see Chapters 117, 122, and 146). Any chronic illness can affect growth
and development, either directly or through changes in factors such as
nutrition, parenting, school attendance, peer interactions, or self-­esteem.
Most children follow similar motor developmental sequences
despite great variability in child-­rearing practices. The attainment of
skills such as the use of complex sentences is less tightly bound to a

maturational schedule. Maturational changes also generate behavioral
challenges at predictable times. Decrements in growth rate and sleep
requirements around 2 years of age often generate concern about poor
appetite and refusal to nap. Although it is possible to accelerate many
developmental milestones (toilet training a 12 month old or teaching a
3 year old to read), the long-­term benefits of such precocious accomplishments are questionable.
In addition to physical changes in size, body proportions, and
strength, maturation brings about hormonal changes. Sexual differentiation, both somatic and neurologic, begins in utero. Both stress and
reproductive hormones affect brain development as well as behavior
throughout development. Steroid production by the fetal gonads leads
to differences in brain structures between males and females.
Temperament describes the stable, early-­appearing individual variations in behavioral dimensions, including emotionality (crying, laughing, sulking), activity level, attention, sociability, and persistence. The
classic theory proposes nine dimensions of temperament (Table 19.1).
These characteristics lead to three common constellations: (1) the easy,
highly adaptable child, who has regular biologic cycles; (2) the difficult
child, who is inflexible, moody, and easily frustrated; and (3) the slow-­
to-­warm-­up child, who needs extra time to adapt to new circumstances.
Various combinations of these clusters also occur. Temperament has long
been described as biologic or “inherited.” Monozygotic twins are rated by
their parents as temperamentally similar more often than are dizygotic
twins. Estimates of heritability suggest that genetic differences account
for 20–60% of the variability of temperament within a population. The
remainder of the variance is attributed to the child’s environment. Maternal prenatal stress and anxiety is associated with child temperament,
possibly through stress hormones. However, certain polymorphisms of
specific genes moderate the influence of maternal stress on infant temperament. Children who are easily frustrated, fearful, or irritable may elicit
negative parental reactions, making these children even more susceptible
to negative parenting behaviors and to poor adjustment to adversity. Longitudinal twin studies of adult personality indicate that changes in personality over time largely result from dissimilar environmental influences,
whereas stability of temperament appears to result from genetic factors.
The concept of temperament can help parents understand and accept
the characteristics of their children without feeling responsible for having caused them. Children who have difficulty adjusting to change

137

may have behavior problems when a new baby arrives or at the time
of school entry. In addition, pointing out the child’s temperament may
allow for adjustment in parenting styles. Behavioral and emotional
problems may develop when the temperamental characteristics of children and parents are in conflict. If parents who keep an irregular schedule have a child who is not readily adaptable, behavioral difficulties are
more likely than if the child has parents who have predictable routines.

Psychologic Influences: Attachment and Contingency

The influence of the child-­rearing environment dominates most current
models of development. Infants in hospitals and orphanages, devoid
of opportunities for attachment, have severe developmental deficits.
Attachment refers to a biologically determined tendency of a young
child to seek proximity to the parent during times of stress and to the
relationship that allows securely attached children to use their parents
to reestablish a sense of well-­being after a stressful experience. Insecure
attachment may be predictive of later behavioral and learning problems.
At all stages of development, children progress optimally when they
have adult caregivers who pay attention to their verbal and nonverbal cues
and respond accordingly. In early infancy, such contingent responsiveness
to signs of overarousal or underarousal helps maintain infants in a state of
quiet alertness and fosters autonomic self-­regulation. Consistent contingent responses (reinforcement depending on the behavior of the other)
to nonverbal gestures create the groundwork for the shared attention and
reciprocity that are critical for later language and social development.

Social Factors: Family Systems and the Ecologic
Model

Contemporary models of child development recognize the critical importance of influences outside the mother–child dyad. Fathers play critical
roles, both in their direct relationships with their children and in supporting mothers. As traditional nuclear families become less dominant,
the influence of other family members and caregivers (grandparents,
foster and adoptive parents, same-­sex partners) becomes increasingly
important. Furthermore, the presence of nurturing and stable caregivers,
in or out of the nuclear family, can help to buffer the impact of a parent
who may struggle with mental illness, substance use, or other afflictions.
As children grow within their larger ecosystem, it is important to recognize and include all relevant caregivers in the child’s care.
Families function as systems, with internal and external boundaries, subsystems, roles, and rules for interaction. In families with
rigidly defined parental subsystems, children may be denied any
decision-­
making, exacerbating rebelliousness. In families with
poorly defined parent–child boundaries, children may be required
to take on responsibilities beyond their years or may be recruited to
play a spousal role.
Family systems theory recognizes that individuals within systems
adopt implicit roles. Although birth order does not have long-­term
effects on personality development, within families the members take
on different roles. One child may be the troublemaker, whereas another
is the negotiator and another is quiet. Changes in one person’s behavior affects every other member of the system; roles shift until a new
equilibrium is found. The birth of a new child, attainment of developmental milestones such as independent walking, the onset of nighttime
fears, diagnosis of a chronic illness, or death of a family member are all
changes that require renegotiation of roles within the family and have
the potential for healthy adaptation or dysfunction.
The family system, in turn, functions within the larger systems of
extended family, subculture, culture, and society. Bronfenbrenner’s
ecologic model depicts these relationships as concentric circles, with
the parent–child dyad at the center (with associated risks and protective factors) and the larger society at the periphery. Changes at any level
are reflected in the levels above and below. Furthermore, these systems
and their interactions change over time, with some influences being
persistent and chronic and others being temporary. The shift from an
industrial economy to one based on service and information and the
influence of systemic racism are examples of how society has profound
effects on families and children. Understanding the child’s greater ecosystem is important to understand their family and the context of their

growth. Factors such as poverty, systemic racism, access to education,
transportation, food, housing, parental employment, and local support
systems are influential factors in a child’s well-­being. Whenever possible, identifying community supports and assets for families can help
promote health and development.

Unifying Concepts: The Transactional Model, Risk,
and Resilience

The transactional model proposes that a child’s status at any point
in time is a function of the interaction between biologic and social
influences. The influences are bidirectional: biologic factors, such

as temperament and health status, affect the child-­rearing environment and are affected by it. A premature infant may cry little and
sleep for long periods; the infant’s depressed parent may welcome
this behavior, setting up a cycle that leads to poor nutrition and
inadequate growth. The child’s failure to thrive may reinforce the
parent’s sense of failure as a parent. At a later stage, impulsivity
and inattention associated with early, prolonged undernutrition
may lead to aggressive behavior. The cause of the aggression in
this case is not the prematurity, the undernutrition, or the maternal depression, but the interaction of all these factors (Fig. 19.3).
Conversely, children with biologic risk factors may nevertheless do

well developmentally if the child-­rearing environment is supportive. Premature infants with electroencephalographic evidence of
neurologic immaturity may be at increased risk for cognitive delay.
When parent–child interactions are optimal, risk of developmental
disability is reduced.
An estimate of developmental risk can begin with risk factors, such
as low income, low literacy, and lack of neighborhood resources.
Stress and anxiety in pregnancy are associated with cognitive, behavioral, and emotional problems in the child. Early stress may have
effects on aging mediated by shortening of telomere length, a link
to health disparities. Risk for negative outcomes over time increases
exponentially as a result of declining plasticity and accumulation of
risk factors (both behavioral and environmental). Interventions are
most effective in young children; over time, risk increases as the ability to change decreases.
Children growing up in poverty experience multiple levels of
developmental risk: increased exposure to biologic risk factors,
such as environmental lead and inadequate nutrition; lack of stimulation in the home; and decreased access to interventional education and therapeutic experiences. As they respond by withdrawal or
acting out, they further discourage positive stimulation from those
around them. Children of adolescent mothers are also at risk. When
early intervention programs provide timely, intensive, comprehensive, and prolonged services, at-­risk children show marked and
sustained upswings in their developmental trajectory. Early identification of children at developmental risk, along with early intervention to support parenting, is critically important (see Chapter
20). Promoting relational health and identifying supportive community resources and interventions can buffer the negative impact
of environmental risk factors.
Children can have appropriate developmental trajectories despite
childhood trauma. Resilience is the ability to withstand, adapt to, and
recover from adversities. There are several modifiable resilience factors: a positive appraisal or outlook and good executive functioning
(see Chapter 49); nurturing parenting; good maternal mental health,
self-­care skills, and consistent household routines; and an understanding of trauma. The personal histories of children who overcome
poverty often include at least one trusted adult (parent, grandparent,
teacher) with whom the child has a special, supportive, close relationship. Pediatric providers are positioned to target and bolster resilience in their patients and families.

Developmental Domains and Theories of Emotion
and Cognition

Child development can also be tracked by the child’s developmental
progress in particular domains, such as gross motor, fine motor, social,
emotional, language, and cognition. Within each of these categories are developmental sequences of changes leading up to particular
attainments. Development in the gross motor domain, from rolling

Social Capital
Income, social resources

to creeping to independent walking, are clear. Others, such as the line
leading to the development of conscience, are subtler.
The concept of a developmental line implies that a child passes
through successive stages. Several developmental theories are based on
stages as qualitatively different epochs in the development of emotion
and cognition (Table 19.2). In contrast, behavioral theories rely less on
qualitative change and more on the gradual modification of behavior
and accumulation of competence.

Psychoanalytic Theories

At the core of Freudian theory is the idea of body-­centered (or
broadly, “sexual”) drives; the emotional health of both the child and
the adult depends on adequate resolution of conflicts brought about
by these drives. Although Freudian ideas have been challenged,
they opened the door to subsequent theories of development.
Erikson recast Freud’s stages in terms of the emerging personality (see Table 19.2). The child’s sense of basic trust develops through
the successful negotiation of infantile needs. As children progress
through these psychosocial stages, different issues become salient.
It is predictable that a toddler will be preoccupied with establishing
a sense of autonomy, whereas a late adolescent may be more focused
on establishing meaningful relationships and an occupational
identity. Erikson recognized that these stages arise in the context
of Western European societal expectations; in other cultures, the
salient issues may be quite different.
Erikson’s work calls attention to the intrapersonal challenges facing children at different ages in a way that facilitates professional
intervention. Knowing that the salient issue for school-­age children
is industry vs inferiority, pediatricians inquire about a child’s experiences of mastery and failure and (if necessary) suggest ways to
ensure adequate successes.

Cognitive Theories

Cognitive development is best understood through the work of
Piaget. A central tenet of Piaget’s work is that cognition changes in
quality, not just quantity (see Table 19.2). During the sensorimotor stage, an infant’s thinking is tied to immediate sensations and a
child’s ability to manipulate objects. The concept of “in” is embodied in a child’s act of putting a block into a cup. With the arrival
of language, the nature of thinking changes dramatically; symbols
increasingly take the place of objects and actions. Piaget described
how children actively construct knowledge for themselves through
the linked processes of assimilation (taking in new experiences
according to existing schemata) and accommodation (creating
new patterns of understanding to adapt to new information). In
this way, children are continually and actively reorganizing cognitive processes.
There have been challenges to some of the Piaget’s basic concepts. Children may reach the stages at variable ages. Of undeniable

importance is Piaget’s focus on cognition as a subject of empirical study, the universality of the progression of cognitive stages,
and the image of a child as actively and creatively interpreting the
world. Piaget’s work is of special importance to pediatricians for
three reasons: (1) Piaget’s observations provide insight into many
puzzling behaviors of infancy, such as the common exacerbation
of sleep problems at 9 and 18 months of age; (2) Piaget’s observations often lend themselves to quick replication in the office, with
little special equipment; and (3) open-­ended questioning, based on
Piaget’s work, can provide insights into children’s understanding of
illness and hospitalization.
However, other studies have found that even young children and
infants are “natural scientists” and able to integrate new information through experimentation. Young children’s learning is highly
similar to the scientific thought process, including inductive reasoning, making predictions, and hypothesis testing. Hypotheses
and conclusions about the world are constantly being revised based
on the child’s experience. When children are faced with evidence
that conflicts with expected outcomes (expectancy violation), they
are motivated to explore and resolve ambiguities. Children can alter
their beliefs when given new evidence. That children utilize probabilistic models and exploration to resolve unexpected outcomes has
strong implications for the advancement of educational theory.
Based on cognitive development, Kohlberg developed a theory
of moral development in six stages, from early childhood through
adulthood. Preschoolers’ earliest sense of right and wrong is egocentric, motivated by externally applied controls. In later stages,
children perceive equality, fairness, and reciprocity in their understanding of interpersonal interactions through perspective taking.
Most youth will reach stage 4, conventional morality, by mid-to late
adolescence. The basic theory has been modified to distinguish
morality from social conventions. Whereas moral thinking considers interpersonal interactions, justice, and human welfare, social
conventions are the agreed-­on standards of behavior particular to a
social or cultural group. Within each stage of development, children
are guided by the basic precepts of moral behavior, but they also
may take into account local standards, such as dress code, classroom behavior, and dating expectations. There is a broader understanding of moral development of even young infants and children
theorizing an innate capacity to relate to others. Moral development
can be found in very young infants, toddlers, and preschoolers who
have a concept of self in relation to others, empathy and caring for
others, and may incorporate their cultural context in a way that
influences how and when moral development occurs.

implied; children, adults, and indeed animals all respond in the
same way. In its simplest form, the behaviorist orientation asserts
that behaviors that are reinforced occur more frequently; behaviors
that are punished or ignored occur less frequently. Reinforcement
may be further divided into positive reinforcement, when a reward
or attention increases the chance of a behavior occurring, and negative reinforcement, when removal of an aversive stimulus increases
the frequency of the behavior. A teacher who allows students who
complete the homework Monday through Thursday not to have an
assignment on Friday is using negative reinforcement to motivate
homework completion during the week.
The strengths of behavioral theory are its simplicity, wide applicability, and conduciveness to scientific verification. A behavioral approach
lends itself to interventions for various common problems, such as temper
tantrums, aggressive preschool behavior, and eating disorders, in which
behaviors are broken down into discrete units. In cognitively limited children and children with autism spectrum disorder, behavioral interventions
using applied behavior analysis approaches have demonstrated the ability to teach new, complex behaviors. Applied behavior analysis has been
particularly useful in the treatment of early-­diagnosed autism spectrum
disorder (see Chapter 58). However, when misbehavior is symptomatic
of an underlying emotional, perceptual, or family problem, an exclusive
reliance on behavior therapy risks leaving the cause untreated. Behavioral
approaches can be taught to parents for application at home.

Behavioral Theory

Statistics Used in Describing Growth and
Development

This theoretical perspective distinguishes itself by its lack of concern with a child’s inner experience. Its focus is on observable
behaviors and measurable factors that either increase or decrease
the frequency with which these behaviors occur. No stages are

Theories Used in Behavioral Interventions

An increasing number of programs or interventions (within and
outside the physician’s office) are designed to influence health
behaviors; some of these models are based on behavioral or cognitive theory or may have attributes of both. The most commonly
employed models are the Health Belief Model, Theory of Reasoned
Action, Theory of Planned Behavior, Social Cognitive Theory, and
Transtheoretical Model, also known as Stages of Change Theory
(see Chapter 18). Pediatricians should be aware of these models and
their similarities and differences (Table 19.3). Interventions based
on these theories have been designed for children and adolescents
in community, clinic, and hospital-­based settings.
Motivational interviewing (MI) is a technique often used in clinical
settings to bring about behavior change (Chapter 18). Briefly, the goal
is to enhance an individual’s motivation to change behavior by exploring and overcoming ambivalence. The therapist is a partner rather
than an authority figure and recognizes that, ultimately, the patient has
control over his or her choices. Pediatric providers can learn brief MI
techniques.

normal (bell-­shaped or gaussian) distribution. This is the case with
anthropometric quantities, such as height and weight, and with
many developmental measures, such as IQ. For a normally distributed measurement, a histogram with the quantity (height, age) on
the x axis and the frequency (the number of children of that height,
or the number who stand on their own at that age) on the y axis generates a bell-­shaped curve. In an ideal bell-­shaped curve, the peak
corresponds to the arithmetic mean (average) of the sample, as
well as to the median and the mode. The median is the value above
and below which 50% of the observations lie; the mode is the value
with the highest number of observations. Distributions are termed
skewed if the mean, median, and mode are not the same number.
The extent to which observed values cluster near the mean determines the width of the bell and can be described mathematically by
the standard deviation (SD). In the ideal normal curve, a range of
values extending from 1 SD below the mean to 1 SD above the mean
includes approximately 68% of the values, and each “tail” above and
below that range contains 16% of the values. A range encompassing ±2 SD includes 95% of the values (with the upper and lower
tails each comprising approximately 2.5% of the values), and ±3 SD
encompasses 99.7% of the values (Table 19.4 and Fig. 19.4).
For any single measurement, its distance away from the mean can
be expressed in terms of the number of SDs (also called a z score);
one can then consult a table of the normal distribution to find out
what percentage of measurements fall within that distance from
the mean. Software to convert anthropometric data into z scores
for epidemiologic purposes is available. A measurement that falls
“outside the normal range” (arbitrarily defined as 2, or sometimes
3, SDs on either side of the mean) is atypical, but not necessarily
indicative of illness. The further a measurement (height, weight,
IQ) falls from the mean, the greater is the probability that it represents not simply normal variation, but rather a different, potentially
pathologic condition.
Another way of relating an individual to a group uses percentiles.
The percentile is the percentage of individuals in the group who have
achieved a certain measured quantity (e.g., height of 95 cm) or a developmental milestone (e.g., walking independently). For anthropometric
data, the percentile cutoffs can be calculated from the mean and SD.
The 5th, 10th, and 25th percentiles correspond to −1.65 SD, −1.3 SD,
and −0.7 SD, respectively. Figure 19.4 demonstrates how frequency distributions of a particular parameter (height) at different ages relate to
the percentile lines on the growth curve.

No single force may be more important to a child’s development than
the environment in which they are raised. Many factors, both positive and negative, contribute to this environment. Parenting practices
provide a foundation to promote healthy child development, protect
against adverse outcomes, and foster resilience. The term positive parenting describes an approach to parenting that achieves these goals.

THE IMPORTANCE OF PARENTING

Interactions between parents and their children provide stimulation
that promotes the development of language, early cognitive skills, and
school readiness. Less frequent participation in interactive parenting
practices, such as reading aloud to children, eating family meals, and
participating in family outings, predicts an increased risk of developmental delay in low-­income families. Interventions that increase parents’ reading to children promote positive developmental outcomes
such as early language and literacy development.
The affective nature of the parent–child interaction is important for
both cognitive and social emotional development. Persistent maternal
depression has been linked to decreases in child IQ scores at school
entry. Early exposure to positive parenting has been associated with
lower rates of childhood depression, risky behavior, delinquency, injuries, behavior problems, and bullying, and with increased likelihood of
empathy and prosocial behavior. The beneficial effects of early maternal sensitivity on social competence have been found to persist into
adulthood, contributing to the growing evidence that early parent–
child interactions have a long-­term impact.
Positive parenting practices, such as using a warm, supportive
approach during conflict, and negative practices, such as maternal
aggression, have been associated with MRI changes in adolescent
brain development in males. Animal models have been used to demonstrate the detrimental effects of stressful early life experiences.
Offspring raised in these environments were more likely to exhibit
fearful behavior and had differences in brain architecture and in
epigenetic changes that alter gene expression. Importantly in these
animal models, increased maternal nurturing could protect against
these changes.

THE ROLE OF THE FAMILY

Parenting occurs in the context of the family, and yet a “one size fits
all” approach to understanding families does not suffice. To understand
the influence of the family environment on parenting practices, it is
important to appreciate the evolving diversity among U.S. families with
respect to culture, race/ethnicity, and family makeup. The U.S. population continues to become more racially/ethnically diverse (61.1% in
2020 vs 54.9% in 2010). Over the last several decades, the percentage of
children raised in single-­parent homes has continued to grow to nearly
25% in 2020, up from 9% in 1960. It is also important to appreciate that
many families face disparities in health and developmental outcomes
related to racism and other forms of discrimination that may occur
on the basis of religion, sexuality/gender, disability, and socioeconomic
status among other factors. For many children these factors interact
to further increase risk for disparities in outcomes. Children living in
single-­parent homes experience poverty at a higher rate than those living in two-­parent homes.

Chapter 20 u Positive Parenting and Support

143

Chronic stress and adverse experiences in childhood can have far-­
reaching consequences that negatively affect health and developmental
outcomes (see Chapters 1 and 2). However, parenting—in the form of
safe, stable, and nurturing relationships (SSNRs)—has been suggested
as one of a number of strategies that can promote resilience and buffer
adversity and turn potentially toxic stress responses into tolerable or
positive responses.

respond positively to responsive and sensitive parenting. Moreover,
childhood traits such as low adaptability, impulsivity, and low frustration tolerance may lead some parents to engage in more negative
parenting practices. These findings illustrate the interactive nature
between parent and child, with parental behavior shaping child
behavior, and vice versa.

PARENTING STYLES

Emotional and behavioral problems are common in childhood.
Early behavioral problems impact at least one in five children under
age 5 in the United States and are associated with impairments in
multiple domains, including family, academic, and social functioning, which often continue into adulthood. Emotional and behavioral problems have been associated with single-­parent households
and poverty. Children in underserved populations experience
life circumstances and structural barriers to care that place them
at greater risk of behavior problems and unmet needs. High rates
of socioeconomic disadvantage, inadequate social infrastructure,
neighborhood exposure to violence, repetitive experiences of discrimination, and chronic exposure to racism among minoritized
children can have significant adverse effects on children’s physical
and mental health. Although negative parenting may contribute to
and exacerbate such problems, positive parenting practices have
been shown to buffer against poor outcome for children growing
up in such adversity.
Other risk factors for the development of challenging behavior
include trauma and developmental problems. Adverse childhood
experiences (ACEs), defined as abuse and neglect, caregiver substance use, caregiver mental health problems, and domestic violence
or criminality, are often present during childhood (see Chapter 1).
In the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-­B eing there
was a cumulative relationship between emotional and behavioral
problems and ACE exposure, with children exposed to four or more
ACEs being almost five times more likely to have internalizing problems than children not exposed to ACEs. A similar relationship was
found for externalizing problems. Studies involving children with
developmental disabilities suggest emotional and behavioral problems occur more frequently in this group than in typically developing children. These children may have delays in self-­regulation
and communication skills as well as increased family stress, which
contribute to the increased likelihood of behavioral challenges.

Parenting practices are significantly influenced by culture, defined as
a pattern of social norms, values, language, and behavior shared by
a group of individuals. Approaches to self-­regulation, for example,
vary across cultures with respect to promoting attention, compliance, delayed gratification, executive function, and effortful control.
In examining parent practices, it is important to recognize the role of
structural racism and bias on the design and interpretation of parenting research.
Three styles of parenting have been described: authoritative,
authoritarian, and permissive. Each style has varying approaches
to parental control and responsiveness. A fourth style, neglectful parenting, has also been suggested. Authoritative parenting
describes a parenting style that is warm, responsive, and accepting
but that also sets expectations for behavior and achievement. Differences are approached with reasoning and discussion rather than
by exerting control. Authoritarian parenting is characterized by
a high degree of parental control in which obedience is expected.
Punishment is often employed to foster compliance rather than verbal discussion. Permissive parenting refers to an approach characterized by warmth and acceptance with the child’s autonomy being
highly valued, but with few rules or expectations. This contrasts
with neglectful parenting, similarly characterized by few rules or
expectations but also by limited parental warmth or responsiveness.
An authoritative parenting style is most likely to be associated with
positive child outcomes across multiple domains, including educational achievement and social-­emotional competence. Parental supervision, consistency, and open communication reduce risky behaviors
in adolescents. Harsh, inconsistent, and coercive discipline and physical punishment have been associated with increases in emotional and
behavioral problems. Child physical abuse is often preceded by corporal punishment. In addition to a higher rate of aggression and behavioral problems, children who have experienced physical punishment
have been found to have lower IQs and smaller prefrontal cortexes
compared to those who have not. Much of the initial research on parenting styles was based on select U.S. populations (White middle-­class
families).

CHILD TEMPERAMENT

As evidenced by the effects of family structure, culture/ethnicity,
and economics, parenting does not occur in isolation. The child
also brings to the parent–child relationship their own personality,
or temperament, a collection of traits that stay relatively constant
over time (see Chapter 19). The initial temperament research identified nine traits: activity level, predictability of behavior, reaction
to new environments, adaptability, intensity, mood, distractibility,
persistence, and sensitivity. Most infants (65%) fit into one of three
groups, easy (40%), difficult (10%), and slow to warm up (15%), and
these patterns are relatively stable over time. Although variations
in temperament traits are part of normal human variations, certain
behavioral difficulties have been associated with certain temperament types. For example, a difficult temperament has been associated with the development of externalizing behavior (e.g., acting
out, disruptive, and aggressive behavior) and, not surprisingly, a
slow-­to-­warm-­up temperament with internalizing behavior (e.g.,
anxious and moody behavior).
Temperament traits are relatively stable, but how the child functions is affected by the environment, especially by parenting and
the “goodness of fit” between the parent and child. Children with
difficult temperament characteristics respond more negatively
to neglectful parenting, and children of all temperament groups

CHILD BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS

DEFINING POSITIVE PARENTING

The precise definition of the components of positive parenting is
lacking. Positive parenting must ensure the child’s safety, health,
and nutrition as well as developmental promotion. Common attributes of positive parenting include caring, leading, providing,
teaching, and communicating with the child in a consistent and
unconditional manner. To account for the long-­term goals of successful parenting in promoting optimal emotional, behavioral, and
developmental outcomes, some suggest the term purposeful parenting and related characteristics (Table 20.1). The characterization
of an ideal approach to parenting will evolve with ever-­changing
societal norms, but key components such as those in Table 20.1 will
likely remain fundamental.

PARENTING AS AN INTERVENTION

The influence of parenting practices on child behavior, development,
and overall adjustment has led to efforts to teach parenting as a method
of primary prevention. The Video Interaction Project (VIP) uses a
coaching and education model with recorded parent–child interactions to foster positive parenting behavior. These parenting behaviors
range from reading aloud to encouraging interactive play. In an urban,
low-­income, primary care setting, parent and child outcomes for the
VIP group were compared to those from a lower-­intensity intervention
(parent mailings encouraging positive parenting behaviors) and a control group. VIP produced the most robust impacts on socioemotional
outcomes, including decreased distress with separation, hyperactivity,
and externalizing behavior in toddlers.

Positive parenting as a public health intervention has resulted in
decreased rates of substantiated child maltreatment cases, out-­of-­
home placements, and child maltreatment injuries. Other effective
public health approaches include home-­visiting programs, which
have been deployed to at-­risk families in an effort to improve maternal and child outcomes. The Maternal, Infant and Early Childhood
Home Visiting Program, authorized as part of the Affordable Care
Act of 2010 and again in 2015, is part of the Medicare Access and
Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Reauthorization Act.
A key component of home-­visiting programs is the promotion of
positive parenting behavior to foster child developmental and
school readiness. Group parenting programs have been deployed
as primary prevention to promote emotional and behavioral adjustment in young children. There is moderate-­quality evidence that
group-­based parenting programs may improve parent–child interactions. These programs typically employ praise, encouragement,
and affection and have been associated with improved self-­esteem
and social and academic competence.
Parenting behaviors have also been employed as an intervention
to treat emotional and behavioral problems in young children. Parenting interventions such as Incredible Years, Triple P Positive Parenting Program, New Forrest Parenting Program, and Child Adult
Relationship Enhancement in Primary Care are effective for at
least short-­term improvements in child conduct problems, parental
mental health, and parenting practices. Also called parent training
programs, most teach the importance of play, rewards, praise, and
consistent discipline and allow parents to practice new skills. This
active-­learning component distinguishes parent training programs

from educational programs, which have been shown to be less
effective.
Teaching emotional communication skills and positive parent–
child interaction skills are associated with parent training programs
that demonstrate a greater increase in parenting skills (Table 20.2).
Several components are associated with programs that show greater
improvements in child externalizing behavior including teaching
parents to interact positively and respond consistently to their children as well as to use time-­out correctly. All successful programs
require parents to practice parenting skills during the program.
Parents have been found to benefit from participation in parenting
programs. Before their participation, parents experienced a loss of control, self-­blame, social isolation, and difficulty dealing with their child’s
emotional and behavioral problems, all of which improved after participation. The few studies that have assessed the long-­term efficacy of
parent-­training programs suggest overall positive child outcomes but
also periods of relapse during which the use of positive parenting skills
decreased. Use of social supports is associated with positive child outcomes and may be an important program component when considering long-­term success.

THE ROLE OF THE PEDIATRICIAN

Pediatricians and other pediatric practitioners have a primary responsibility to support the needs of parents and their children. Numerous
programs and interventions have been developed to be delivered effectively and efficiently in the primary care setting.

Chapter 20 u Positive Parenting and Support
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) publishes Bright Futures
and the associated Guidelines for Preventive Care to standardize
child health promotion and prevention in primary care. A substantial
amount of the content in Bright Futures maps to the positive-­parenting
domains of safety, feeding, developmental promotion, and protection.
Implementing Bright Futures guidelines in health supervision visits is
an important way for pediatric practitioners to support the promotion
of positive parenting in practice. The AAP’s policy statement titled Preventing Childhood Toxic Stress: Partnering with Families and Communities to Promote Relational Health describes the importance of
the parent–child relationship in building the foundation for healthy
child development as well as buffering the effects of more significant
stressors.
Reading aloud to children is a powerful strategy to promote
language development, early literacy, and positive parent–child
interaction. The Reach Out and Read program is a primary care–
based intervention that trains practitioners to encourage parents to
read with their child and provides books to at-­risk families. In the
absence of a formal partnership with Reach Out and Read, practitioners should promote the benefits of reading aloud to children
and support parents in their efforts to develop habits that incorporate reading into daily routines.
In addition to VIP described earlier, other primary care models to promote parenting have been studied. The Healthy Steps for
Young Children program is a strengths-­based approach delivered
in the primary care setting from infancy to age 3 years. Healthy
Steps promotes changes in parents’ knowledge, beliefs, and psychologic health and changes in parenting behaviors using a variety
of methods delivered in the office setting by the practitioner and
Healthy Steps specialists and through home visits. Extensive evaluations have shown improvements in parental well-­being, parenting
practices, and parent–child attachment and decreased child behavior problems. Another promising approach uses community health
workers and nurses to provide parenting education and allow mothers to practice parenting skills outside the office setting.
If participation in a formal parenting program is not possible, pediatric practitioners can still implement a systematic approach to support the needs of parents and their children. Practitioners can take
advantage of materials in the public domain from national organizations devoted to child and family health, such as ZERO TO THREE
(https://www.zerotothree.org/) and AAP (https://www.aap.org/). The
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also provides
evidenced-­
based parenting resources (https://www.cdc.gov/parents/
essentials/index.html). Additional components include early identification of parents’ concerns, addressing concerns in a supportive and
nonjudgmental way, and providing linkage to treatment services when
appropriate.
Parents want more information about child development, but
parents of children with behavior problems often feel stigmatized
and isolated. Practitioners are encouraged to be supportive and
optimistic in their interactions with families and to develop a partnership aimed at promoting parent and child health (see Chapter
18). Practitioners may also encourage parents to practice new skills
briefly in the office setting before trying a new skill at home. Active
modeling by the practitioner using “teachable moments” may also
be effective.

DISCIPLINE/PUNISHMENT

Discipline is meant to teach children to learn good behavior and
thus enhance child development. There are many positive parenting
approaches to discipline that help avoid confrontations and to also
correct behavior without conflict or physical punishment (Tables
20.3 and 20.4) (see Chapters 25 and 26). In addition, parents should
teach by example; rather than prompting a child to say thank you,

the parents saying thank you is a behavior that an imitating child
will follow. Furthermore, when possible, give the child a choice
between positive activities, thus enhancing autonomy and preventing conflict. In verbal children, it is helpful to engage the child in
problem solving by asking “how can we make this better?”
Corporal (physical) punishment is viewed as a violation of the
child’s right of protection by the United Nations Convention on the
Rights of Children. It is viewed by the CDC as a form of child abuse.
Corporal punishment is the use of force to produce harm, pain, or
discomfort in a dependent child for the purpose of correcting behavior or showing disapproval. It may be manifest by hitting, striking,
smacking, slapping, whupping, pinching, kicking, shaking, burning/
scalding, pulling hair, washing the mouth with soap or other harmful
substances, forcing the child to assume a painful or prolonged posture/position, or using an object to inflict harm. Parents who use corporal punishment may have experienced this punishment as a child.
Use of corporal punishment is also associated with adults who misuse
drugs, are depressed, or experience intimate partner violence.
The consequences of corporal punishment to the child include worsening behavioral problems including aggression and adverse effects on
cognitive development and mental health (anxiety, depression). In
addition, corporal punishment does not correct the behavior. Furthermore, there may be a dose-­response relationship between the frequency
of corporal punishment and adverse child behaviors and development.

Chapter 21

Assessment of Fetal
Growth and Development
Alexander S. Whitaker and Susan Feigelman
The developing fetus is affected by social and environmental influences, including maternal nutritional status, substance use (both legal
and illicit), and psychologic trauma. Correspondingly, the psychologic
alterations experienced by the parents during the gestation profoundly
impact the lives of all members of the family. The complex interplay
among these forces and the somatic and neurologic transformations
occurring in the fetus influence growth and behavior at birth, through
infancy, and potentially throughout the individual’s life.

SOMATIC DEVELOPMENT
Embryonic Period

Table 21.1 lists milestones of prenatal development. By 6 days postconception age, as implantation begins, the embryo consists of a
spherical mass of cells with a central cavity (the blastocyst). By 2 weeks,
implantation is complete and the uteroplacental circulation has begun;
the embryo has two distinct layers, endoderm and ectoderm, and the
amnion has started to form. By 3 weeks, the third primary germ layer
(mesoderm) has appeared, along with a primitive neural tube and blood
vessels. Paired heart tubes have begun to pump.
During weeks 4-­8, lateral folding of the embryologic plate, followed
by growth at the cranial and caudal ends and the budding of arms and
legs, produces a human-­like shape. Precursors of skeletal muscle and
vertebrae (somites) appear, along with the branchial arches that will
form the mandible, maxilla, palate, external ear, and other head and
neck structures. Lens placodes appear, marking the site of future eyes;
the brain grows rapidly. By the end of week 8, as the embryonic period
closes, the rudiments of all major organ systems have developed; the
crown-­rump length is 3 cm.

Fetal Period

From the ninth week on (fetal period), somatic changes consist of
rapid body growth as well as differentiation of tissues, organs, and
organ systems. Figure 21.1 depicts changes in body proportion. By
week 10, the face is recognizably human. The midgut returns to the
abdomen from the umbilical cord, rotating counterclockwise to bring
the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine into their normal
positions. By week 12, the gender of the external genitals becomes
clearly distinguishable. Lung development proceeds, with the budding of bronchi, bronchioles, and successively smaller divisions. By
weeks 20-­24, primitive alveoli have formed and surfactant production has begun; before that time, the absence of alveoli renders the
lungs useless as organs of gas exchange.
During the third trimester, weight triples and length doubles as body
stores of protein, fat, iron, and calcium increase.

NEUROLOGIC DEVELOPMENT

During the third week, a neural plate appears on the ectodermal
surface of the trilaminar embryo. Infolding produces a neural tube
that will become the central nervous system and a neural crest that
will become the peripheral nervous system. Neuroectodermal cells
differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and ependymal cells, whereas microglial cells are derived from mesoderm.
By the fifth week, the three main subdivisions of forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain are evident. The dorsal and ventral horns of
the spinal cord have begun to form, along with the peripheral motor
and sensory nerves. Myelination begins at midgestation and continues for years.

By the end of the embryonic period (week 8), the gross structure of
the nervous system has been established. On a cellular level, neurons
migrate outward to form the six cortical layers. Migration is complete
by the sixth month, but differentiation continues. Axons and dendrites
form synaptic connections at a rapid pace, making the central nervous
system vulnerable to teratogenic or hypoxic influences throughout gestation. Figure 21.2 shows rates of increase in DNA (a marker of cell
number), overall brain weight, and cholesterol (a marker of myelinization). Epigenetic modifications are made in the presence of fetal
gonadal steroids, directing masculinization of the male brain. The
prenatal and postnatal peaks of DNA probably represent rapid growth
of neurons and glia, respectively. The glial cells are important in shaping the brain and neuronal circuits. The various types of glial cells are
needed for the formation of axonal myelin sheaths, a range of functions
in the formation and maintenance of neural pathways, and removal of
waste (the brain has no lymphoid system for this task).
By the time of birth, the structure of the brain is complete. However,
many cells will undergo apoptosis (cell death). Synapses will be pruned
back substantially, and new connections will be made, largely as a
result of experience. Many psychiatric and developmental disorders
are thought to result at least in part from disruptions in the functional
connectivity of brain networks. Disorders of connectivity may begin
during fetal life; MRI studies provide a developmental timetable for
such connections that lend support to the possible role of disruptions
in the establishment of such connections.

BEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENT

No behavioral evidence of neural function is detectable until the third
month. Reflexive responses to tactile stimulation develop in a craniocaudal sequence. By weeks 13-­14, breathing and swallowing motions
appear. The grasp reflex appears at 17 weeks and is well developed by 27
weeks. Eye opening occurs around 26-­28 weeks. By midgestation, the
full range of neonatal movements can be observed.
During the third trimester, fetuses respond to external stimuli with
heart rate elevation and body movements, which can be observed with
ultrasound (see Chapter 117). Reactivity to auditory (vibroacoustic)
and visual (bright light) stimuli vary, depending on their behavioral
state, which can be characterized as quiet sleep, active sleep, or awake.
Individual differences in the level of fetal activity are usually noted by
mothers. Fetuses will preferentially turn to light patterns in the configuration of the human face. Fetal movement is affected by maternal
medications and diet, increasing after ingestion of caffeine. Behavior
may be entrained to the mother’s diurnal rhythms: asleep during the
day, active at night. Abnormal fetal movement patterns are found in
neonates with subsequent muscular or neurologic abnormalities.
Fetal movement increases in response to a sudden auditory tone
but decreases after several repetitions. This demonstrates habituation, a basic form of learning in which repeated stimulation results
in a response decrement. If the tone changes in pitch, the movement
increases again, which is evidence that the fetus distinguishes between
a familiar, repeated tone and a novel tone. Habituation improves in
older fetuses and decreases in neurologically impaired or physically
stressed fetuses. Similar responses to visual and tactile stimuli have
been observed.

PSYCHOLOGIC CHANGES IN PARENTS

Many psychologic changes occur during pregnancy. An unplanned
pregnancy may be met with anger, denial, or depression. Ambivalent
feelings are common, whether or not the pregnancy was planned. Elation at the thought of producing a baby and the wish to be the perfect
parent compete with fears of inadequacy and of the lifestyle changes
that parenting will impose. Parents of an existing child may feel protective of the child, worried that the child may feel less valued. Old conflicts may resurface as a woman psychologically identifies with her own
mother and with herself as a child. The father-­to-­be faces similar mixed
feelings, and problems in the parental relationship may intensify.
Tangible evidence that a fetus exists as a separate being, whether
as a result of ultrasonic visualization or awareness of fetal movements known as quickening (at 16-­20 weeks), often heightens a

woman’s feelings. Parents worry about the fetus’s healthy development and mentally rehearse what they will do if the child is
malformed, including their response to evidence of abnormality
through ultrasound, amniocentesis, or other fetal laboratory tests.
Toward the end of pregnancy, a woman becomes aware of patterns
of fetal activity and reactivity and begins to ascribe to her fetus
an individual personality and an ability to survive independently.
Appreciation of the psychologic vulnerability of the expectant parents and of the powerful contribution of fetal behavior facilitates
supportive clinical intervention.

THREATS TO FETAL DEVELOPMENT

Mortality and morbidity are highest during the prenatal period (see
Chapter 114). An estimated 50% of all pregnancies end in spontaneous
abortion, including 10–15% of all clinically recognized pregnancies.
The majority occur in the first trimester. Many spontaneous abortions occur as a result of chromosomal abnormalities, most commonly
aneuploidies.
Teratogens associated with gross physical and mental abnormalities
include various infectious agents (e.g., toxoplasmosis, rubella, syphilis,
Zika virus), chemical agents (e.g., mercury, thalidomide, antiepileptic
medications, retinoids, ethanol), high temperature, and radiation (see
Chapters 117 and 758).
Teratogenic effects may also result in decreased growth and cognitive or behavioral deficits that only become apparent later in life.
Nicotine has vasoconstrictor properties and may disrupt dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways. Prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke
is associated with lower birthweight, stunting, and smaller head circumference. It is also associated with changes in neonatal neurodevelopmental assessments; later, these children are at increased risk for
learning problems, attention and behavior disorders, and other long-­
term health effects. Alcohol is a common teratogen affecting physical development, cognition, and behavior (see Chapter 146). Prenatal
exposure to opiates can result in neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS)
characterized by irritability, poor feeding, tremors and temperature
instability in newborn infants. Affected infants may require treatment
with low-­dose opiates to abate the symptoms. School-­age children with
a history of NAS are significantly more likely to have educational disabilities, even when controlling for external factors such as maternal
educational attainment and gestational age.
The effects of prenatal exposure to cocaine, also occurring through
alternations in placental blood flow and in direct toxic effects to the
developing brain, have been followed in several cohorts and are less
dramatic than previously believed. Exposed adolescents show small
but significant effects in behavior and functioning but may not show
cognitive impairment. Associated risk factors including alcohol and
tobacco use, and postnatal environments frequently characterized by
toxic stress, may explain some of the observed negative developmental
outcomes. (see Chapters 1, 15, and 17).
The association between an inadequate nutrient supply to the fetus
and low birthweight has been recognized for decades; this adaptation

on the part of the fetus presumably increases the likelihood that the
fetus will survive until birth. For any potential fetal insult, the extent
and nature of its effects are determined by characteristics of the host
as well as the dose and timing of the exposure. Inherited differences in
the metabolism of ethanol, timing of exposure, and the mother’s diet
may explain the variability in fetal alcohol effects. Organ systems are
most vulnerable during periods of maximum growth and differentiation, generally during the first trimester (organogenesis) (http://www
.epa.gov/children/children-­are-­not-­little-­adults details critical periods
and specific developmental abnormalities).
Fetal adaptations or responses to an adverse situation in utero,
termed fetal programming or developmental plasticity, have lifelong implications. Fetal programming may prepare the fetus for
an environment that matches that experienced in utero. Fetal programming in response to some environmental and nutritional signals in utero increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
and obesity in later life. These adverse long-­term effects appear to
represent a mismatch between environmental conditions faced by a
fetus or neonate and the conditions that the individual will confront
later in life. A fetus deprived of adequate calories may or may not
face famine as a child or adolescent. One proposed mechanism for
fetal programming is epigenetic imprinting, in which one of two
alleles is turned off through environmentally induced epigenetic
modification (see Chapter 97). Many environmental factors have
been found to play a role in producing epigenetic modifications that
are both transgenerational (direct effect on the developing fetus)
and intergenerational (changes in the germ cells that will affect
future generations).
Just as the fetal adaptations to the in utero environment may increase
the likelihood of later metabolic conditions, the fetus adapts to the
mother’s psychologic distress. In response to the stressful environment,
physiologic changes involving the hypothalamic-­pituitary-­adrenal axis
and the autonomic nervous system occur. Dysregulation of these systems may explain the associations observed in some but not all studies
between maternal distress and negative infant outcomes. These negative outcomes include low birthweight, spontaneous abortion, prematurity, and decreased head circumference. In addition, children born
to mothers experiencing high stress levels have been found to have
higher rates of inattention, impulsivity, conduct disorders, and negative cognitive changes. Although these changes may have been adaptive
in primitive cultures, they are maladaptive in modern societies, leading
to psychopathology. Genetic variability, timing of stress during sensitive periods, and the quality of postnatal parenting can attenuate or
exacerbate these associations.

Regardless of gestational age, the newborn (neonatal) period
begins at birth and includes the first month of life. During this time,
marked physiologic transitions occur in all organ systems, and the
infant learns to respond to many forms of external stimuli. Because
infants thrive physically and psychologically only in the context of
their social relationships, any description of the newborn’s developmental status has to include consideration of the parents’ role as
well.

PARENTAL ROLE IN PARENT–INFANT ATTACHMENT

Parenting a newborn infant requires dedication because a newborn’s
needs are urgent, continuous, and often unclear. Parents must attend
to an infant’s signals and respond empathically. Many factors influence
parents’ ability to assume this role.

Prenatal Factors

Pregnancy is a period of psychologic preparation for the profound
demands of parenting. Expectant parents may experience ambivalence, particularly (but not exclusively) if the pregnancy was
unplanned. Financial concerns, physical illness, prior miscarriages
or stillbirths, or other crises may interfere with future bonding.
For adolescent parents, the demand that they relinquish their own
developmental agenda, such as an active social life, may be especially burdensome.
The transition to parenthood is a unique developmental phase,
and a stressful one. Lifetime experiences of parents, particularly
traumatic ones, may affect their approaches to developing a nurturing relationship with their infant (Table 22.1). It has been shown
that an increasing number of adverse childhood experiences
(ACEs) may be associated with increased parental stress, a more
authoritarian style of parenting, increased risk for child abuse, and
greater insecurity in parent–child attachment (bonding). Identifying parental ACEs and addressing them with community resources,
including parenting classes, parent aides, and parent support groups
may help provide parents with the resilience to mitigate the effects
of ACEs.

Chapter 22 u The Newborn
Social support during pregnancy, particularly support from the
partner and close family members, is also important. Family support
can promote resilience in the face of ACEs as described earlier.
Many decisions have to be made by parents in anticipation of the
birth of their child. One important choice is how the infant will be
nourished. Among the important benefits of breastfeeding is its promotion of bonding. Providing breastfeeding education for the parents
during prenatal pediatric or obstetric care can increase maternal confidence in breastfeeding after delivery, reduce stress during the newborn
period, and promote increased breastfeeding rates and duration (see
Chapter 61).

Peripartum and Postpartum Influences

The continuous presence of a support person during labor results
in shorter labor and fewer obstetric complications (including cesarean section). These beneficial effects may be even more pronounced
when the support person is specially trained and present solely for
the purpose of continuous support (a doula). Early skin-­to-­skin
contact between mothers and infants immediately after birth is associated with an increased rate and longer duration of breastfeeding.
Most new parents value even a brief period of uninterrupted time in
which to get to know their new infant, and increased mother–infant
contact over the first days of life may improve long-­term mother–
child interactions. Nonetheless, early separation, although predictably very stressful, does not inevitably impair a mother’s ability to
bond with her infant.
Postpartum mood and anxiety disorder (PMAD) may occur in
the first week or up to 6 months after delivery and can adversely
affect neonatal growth and development. Screening tools, such as
the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), are available
for use during neonatal and infant visits to the pediatric provider.
Screening mothers for PMAD is recommended at the 1, 2, 4, and 6
month well child visit. PMAD is also seen in partners of postpartum
women, but peaks later at 3-­6 months. Pediatric providers should
consider screening partners at the 6 month well child visit using the
EPDS. A score of 10 or higher, or a positive response to question 10
(suicidal thoughts), in either postpartum women or their partners
warrants referral for evaluation (Table 22.2).

THE INFANT’S ROLE IN PARENT–INFANT
ATTACHMENT

The in utero environment contributes greatly but not completely to
the future growth and development of the fetus. Abnormalities in
maternal-­fetal placental circulation and maternal glucose metabolism or the presence of maternal infection can result in abnormal
fetal growth. Infants may be small or large for gestational age as
a result. These abnormal growth patterns not only predispose
infants to an increased requirement for medical intervention, but
they also may affect their ability to respond behaviorally to their
parents.

Physical Examination

Examination of the newborn should include an evaluation of
growth (see Chapter 21) and an observation of behavior. The average term newborn weighs approximately 3.4 kg (7.5 lb); boys are
slightly heavier than girls. The average length and head circumference are about 50 cm (20 in) and 35 cm (14 in), respectively, in term
infants. Each newborn’s growth parameters should be plotted on
growth curves specific for that infant’s gestational age to determine
the appropriateness of size. Specific growth charts for conditions
associated with variations in growth patterns have also been developed. It is important to note that in the United States, significant
disparities exist in low birthweight (<2,500 g) rates with higher
rates in low socioeconomic status (SES) groups and in minoritized
populations.
The infant’s response to being examined may be useful in assessing its vigor, alertness, and tone. Observing how the parents handle

149

their infant, their comfort, and affection is also important. The
order of the physical examination should be from the least to the
most intrusive maneuvers. Assessing visual tracking and response
to sound and noting changes of tone with level of activity and alertness are very helpful. Performing this examination and sharing
impressions with parents is an important opportunity to facilitate
bonding (see Chapter 115).

Interactional Abilities

Soon after birth, neonates are alert and ready to interact and nurse.
This first alert-­awake period may be affected by maternal analgesics
and anesthetics or fetal hypoxia. Neonates are nearsighted, having
a fixed focal length of 8-­12 inches, approximately the distance from
the breast to the mother’s face, as well as an inborn visual preference for faces. Hearing is well developed, and infants preferentially
turn toward a female voice. These innate abilities and predilections
increase the likelihood that when a mother gazes at her newborn, the
baby will gaze back. The initial period of social interaction, usually
lasting about 40 minutes, is followed by a period of somnolence. After
that, briefer periods of alertness or excitation alternate with sleep.
If a mother misses her baby’s first alert-­awake period, she may not
experience as long a period of social interaction for several days. The
hypothalamic-­midbrain-­limbic-­paralimbic-­cortical circuits of the
parent’s brain together support responses to the infant that are critical
for effective parenting (e.g., emotion, attention, motivation, empathy,
decision-­making).

Modulation of Arousal

Adaptation to extrauterine life requires rapid and profound physiologic changes, including aeration of the lungs, rerouting of the
circulation, and activation of the intestinal tract. The necessary
behavioral changes are no less profound. To obtain nourishment, to
avoid hypo-­and hyperthermia, and to ensure safety, neonates must
react appropriately to an expanded range of sensory stimuli. Infants
must become aroused in response to stimulation, but not so overaroused that their behavior becomes disorganized. Underaroused
infants are not able to feed and interact; overaroused infants show
signs of autonomic instability, including flushing or mottling, perioral pallor, hiccupping, vomiting, uncontrolled limb movements, and
inconsolable crying.

Behavioral States

The organization of infant behavior into discrete behavioral states
may reflect an infant’s inborn ability to regulate arousal. Six states
have been described: quiet sleep, active sleep, drowsy, alert, fussy,
and crying. In the alert state, infants visually fixate on objects or
faces and follow them horizontally and (within a month) vertically;
they also reliably turn toward a novel sound, as if searching for its
source. When overstimulated, they may calm themselves by looking
away, yawning, or sucking on their lips or hands, thereby increasing parasympathetic activity and reducing sympathetic nervous
system activity. The behavioral state determines an infant’s muscle
tone, spontaneous movement, electroencephalogram pattern, and
response to stimuli. In active sleep, an infant may show progressively less reaction to a repeated heelstick (habituation), whereas in
the drowsy state, the same stimulus may push a child into fussing
or crying.

Mutual Regulation

Parents actively participate in an infant’s state regulation, alternately
stimulating and soothing. In turn, they are regulated by the infant’s
signals, responding to cries of hunger with a letdown of milk (or
with a bottle). Such interactions constitute a system directed toward
furthering the infant’s physiologic homeostasis and physical growth.
At the same time, they form the basis for the emerging psychologic
relationship between parent and child. Infants come to associate the
presence of the parent with the pleasurable reduction of tension (as

in feeding) and show this preference by calming more quickly for
their parent than for a stranger. This response in turn strengthens a
parent’s sense of efficacy and their connection with their baby.

IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PEDIATRICIAN

The pediatrician can support healthy newborn development in several
ways.

Optimal Practices

A prenatal pediatric visit allows pediatricians to assess both the
strengths of the expectant parents and any needs they may have in
anticipation of the birth of their infant. This should include assessment of social determinants of health and may consist of addressing
needs such as baby supplies, financial assistance, and parental mental health support. Supportive hospital policies include the use of
birthing rooms rather than operating suites and delivery rooms;
encouraging the partner or a trusted relative or friend to remain with
the mother during labor or the provision of a professional doula; the
practice of giving the newborn infant to the mother immediately
after drying and a brief assessment; keeping the newborn with the
mother rather than in a central nursery; and avoiding in-­hospital
distribution of infant formula. Such policies (“Baby Friendly Hospital”) have been shown to significantly increase breastfeeding rates
(see Chapter 115.3). After discharge, home visits by nurses and
lactation counselors can reduce early feeding problems and identify emerging medical conditions in either mother or baby. Infants
requiring transport to another hospital should be brought to see the
mother first, if at all possible. Timing of hospital discharge should
be individualized for each maternal–infant dyad based on the mode
of delivery, presence or absence of specific risk factors, and any
problems identified during the birth hospitalization. Some healthy
term newborns may be discharged before 48 hours of life, and these
newborns should be evaluated with a follow up visit by 3-­5 days
after birth and within 48-­72 hours after discharge. The timing of
the first visit for newborns with a longer initial hospital stay will
depend on the newborn’s specific issues and identified needs.

Assessing Parent–Infant Interactions

During a feeding or when infants are alert and face-­to-­face with
their parents, it is normal for the dyad to appear absorbed in one
another. Infants who become overstimulated by the parent’s voice
or activity may turn away or close their eyes, leading to a premature
termination of the encounter. Alternatively, the infant may be ready
to interact, but the parent may appear preoccupied. Asking a new
mother about her own emotional state, and inquiring specifically
about a history of depression, facilitates referral for therapy, which
may provide long-­term benefits to the child.

Teaching About Individual Competencies

The Newborn Behavior Assessment Scale (NBAS) provides a
formal measure of an infant’s neurodevelopmental competencies,
including state control, autonomic reactivity, reflexes, habituation,
and orientation toward auditory and visual stimuli. This examination can also be used to demonstrate to parents an infant’s capabilities and vulnerabilities. Parents might learn that they need to
undress their infant to increase the level of arousal or to swaddle the
infant to reduce overstimulation by containing random arm movements. The NBAS can be used to support the development of positive early parent–infant relationships. Demonstration of the NBAS
to parents in the first week of life has been shown to correlate with
improvements in the caretaking environment months later.

Chapter 23

The First Year
Mutiat T. Onigbanjo and Susan Feigelman
The prenatal period and the first year of life provide the platform for
remarkable growth and development, setting the trajectory for a child’s
life. Neural plasticity, the ability of the brain to be shaped by experience, both positive and negative, is at its peak. Total brain volume
doubles in the first year of life and increases by an additional 15% over
the second year. Total brain volume at age 1 month is approximately
36% of adult volume but by age 1 year is approximately 72% (83% by
2 years) (Fig. 23.1).
The acquisition of seemingly “simple” skills, such as swallowing, reflects a series of intricate and highly coordinated processes
involving multiple levels of neural control distributed among several physiologic systems whose nature and relationships mature
throughout the first year of life. Substantial learning of the basic
tools of language (phonology, word segmentation) occurs during
infancy. Speech processing in older individuals requires defined
and precise neuronal networks; the infant brain possesses a structural and functional organization similar to that of adults, suggesting that structural neurologic processing of speech may guide
infants to discover the properties of their native language. Myelination of the cortex begins at 7-­8 months’ gestation and continues into
adolescence and young adulthood. It proceeds posterior to anterior, allowing progressive maturation of sensory, motor, and finally
associative pathways. Given the importance of iron, cholesterol, and
other nutrients in myelination, adequate stores throughout infancy
are critical (see Chapter 61). Insufficient interactions with caregivers or the wider environment may alter experience-­dependent processes that are critical to brain structure development and function
during infancy. Although for some processes, subsequent stimulation may allow catch-­up; as the periods of plasticity close during
the rapid developmental changes occurring in infancy, more permanent deficits may result.
The infant acquires new competences in all developmental domains.
The concept of developmental trajectories recognizes that complex skills
build on simpler ones; it is also important to realize how development in
each domain affects functioning in all the others. All growth parameters
should be plotted using the World Health Organization charts, which
show how children from birth through 72 months “should” grow under
optimal circumstances (see Figs. 24.1 and 24.2). Table 23.1 presents
an overview of key milestones by domain; Table 23.2 presents similar
information arranged by age. Table 23.3 presents age at time of x-­ray
appearance of centers of ossification. Parents often seek information
about “normal development” during this period and should be directed
to reliable sources, including the American Academy of Pediatrics website (www.healthychildren.org) or the Center for Disease Control website
(www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/milestones/index.html).

AGE 0-­2 MONTHS

In the full-­term infant, myelination is present by the time of birth in the
dorsal brainstem, cerebellar peduncles, and posterior limb of the internal capsule. The cerebellar white matter acquires myelin by 1 month of
age and is well myelinated by 3 months. The subcortical white matter of
the parietal, posterior frontal, temporal, and calcarine cortex is partially
myelinated by 3 months of age. In this period the infant experiences tremendous growth. Physiologic changes allow the establishment of effective feeding routines and a predictable sleep–wake cycle. The social
interactions that occur as parents and infants accomplish these tasks lay
the foundation for cognitive and emotional development.

to 2 years. J Neurosci. 2008;28:12176–12182.)

Physical Development

A newborn’s weight may initially decrease 10% (vaginal delivery) to 12%
(cesarean section) below birthweight in the first week as a result of excretion of excess extravascular fluid and limited nutritional intake. Nutrition improves as colostrum is replaced by higher-­fat content breast milk,
infants learn to latch on and suck more efficiently, and mothers become
more comfortable with feeding techniques. Infants regain or exceed
birthweight by 2 weeks of age and should grow at approximately 30 g (1
oz) per day during the first month (see Table 27.1). This is the period of
fastest postnatal growth. Arms are held to the sides. Limb movements
consist largely of uncontrolled writhing, with apparently purposeless
opening and closing of the hands. Smiling occurs involuntarily. Eye gaze,
head turning, and sucking are under better control and thus can be used
to demonstrate infant perception and cognition. An infant’s preferential
turning toward the mother’s voice is evidence of recognition memory.
Six behavioral states have been described (see Chapter 22). Initially,
sleep and wakefulness are evenly distributed throughout the 24 hour
day (Fig. 23.2). Neurologic maturation accounts for the consolidation
of sleep into blocks of 5 or 6 hours at night, with brief awake, feeding
periods. Learning also occurs; infants whose parents are consistently
more interactive and stimulating during the day learn to concentrate
their sleeping during the night.

Cognitive Development

Infants can differentiate among patterns, colors, and consonants. They
can recognize facial expressions (smiles) as similar, even when they
appear on different faces. They also can match abstract properties of
stimuli, such as contour, intensity, or temporal pattern, across sensory

modalities. Infants at 2 months of age can discriminate rhythmic patterns in native vs nonnative language. Infants appear to seek stimuli
actively, as though satisfying an innate need to make sense of the world.
These phenomena point to the integration of sensory inputs in the central nervous system. Caretaking activities provide visual, tactile, olfactory, and auditory stimuli, all of which support the development of
cognition. Infants habituate to the familiar, attending less to repeated
stimuli and increasing their attention to novel stimuli.

Emotional Development

The infant is dependent on the environment to meet its needs. The consistent availability of a trusted adult to meet the infant’s urgent needs
creates the conditions for secure attachment. Basic trust vs mistrust,
the first of Erikson’s psychosocial stages (see Chapter 19), depends on
attachment and reciprocal maternal bonding. Crying occurs in response
to stimuli that may be obvious (a soiled diaper) but are often obscure
(see Chapter 23.1). Infants who are consistently picked up and held in
response to distress cry less at 1 year and show less aggressive behavior
at 2 years. Infants of adolescent mothers who are trained to carry their
babies demonstrate secure attachment. Infants cry in response to the cry
of another infant, which has been interpreted as an early sign of empathy.

Implications for Parents and Pediatricians

Success or failure in establishing feeding and sleep cycles influences
parents’ feelings of competence. When things go well, the parents’
anxiety and ambivalence, as well as the exhaustion of the early weeks,
decrease. Infant issues (e.g., colic) or familial conflict may prevent this
from occurring. With physical recovery from delivery and hormonal

normalization, the mild postpartum “blues” that affects many mothers
passes. If the mother continues to feel sad, overwhelmed, or anxiety,
the possibility of moderate to severe postpartum depression or anxiety, found in 20–25% of postpartum women, needs to be considered.
Major depression that arises during pregnancy or in the postpartum
period threatens the mother–child relationship and is a risk factor for
later cognitive and behavioral problems. Postpartum depression is
often reported in mothers and can also occur in fathers. It can present over the course of a year with symptoms of depression or irritability. The pediatrician may be the first professional to encounter the
depressed parent and should be instrumental in assisting the parent in
seeking treatment (see Chapter 22).

AGE 2–­6 MONTHS

At about age 2 months, the emergence of voluntary (social) smiles and
increasing eye contact mark a change in the parent–child relationship,
heightening the parents’ sense of being loved reciprocally. During the
next months, an infant’s range of motor and social control and cognitive
engagement increases dramatically. Mutual regulation takes the form of

complex social interchanges, resulting in strong mutual attachment and
enjoyment. Routines are established. Parents are less fatigued.

Physical Development

Between 3 and 4 months of age, the rate of growth slows to approximately 20 g/day (see Table 27.1 and Figs. 24.1 and 24.2). By age 4
months, birthweight is doubled. Early reflexes that limited voluntary
movement recede (e.g., primitive reflexes; see Chapter 630). Disappearance of the asymmetric tonic neck reflex means that infants can
begin to examine objects in the midline and manipulate them with
both hands. Waning of the early grasp reflex allows infants both to
hold objects and to let them go voluntarily. A novel object may elicit
purposeful, although inefficient, reaching. The quality of spontaneous
movements also changes, from larger (proximal) writhing to smaller,
circular (distal) movements that have been described as “fidgety.”
Abnormal or absent fidgety movements may constitute a risk factor for
later neurologic abnormalities.
Increasing control of truncal flexion makes intentional rolling possible. Once infants can hold their heads steady while sitting, they can

gaze across at things rather than merely looking up at them, opening up a
new visual range. They can begin taking food from a spoon. At the same
time, maturation of the visual system allows greater depth perception.
In this period, infants achieve stable state regulation and regular sleep–
wake cycles. Total sleep requirements are approximately 14-­16 hours per
24 hours, with about 9-­10 hours concentrated at night and 2 naps per day.
Approximately 70% of infants sleep for a 6-­8 hour stretch by age 6 months
(see Fig. 23.2). By 4-­6 months, the sleep electroencephalogram shows a
mature pattern, with demarcation of rapid eye movement and three stages
of non–rapid eye movement sleep. The sleep cycle remains shorter than in

adults (50-­60 minutes vs approximately 90 minutes). As a result, infants
arouse to light sleep or wake frequently during the night, setting the stage
for behavioral sleep problems (see Chapter 31).

Cognitive Development

The overall effect of these developments is a qualitative change. At 4
months of age, infants are described as “hatching” socially, becoming
interested in a wider world. During feeding, infants no longer focus
exclusively on the mother, but become distracted. In the mother’s arms,
the infant may literally turn around, preferring to face outward.

development. Infants come to associate certain sensations through frequent repetition. The proprioceptive feeling of holding up the hand and
wiggling the fingers always accompanies the sight of the fingers moving. Such “self ” sensations are consistently linked and reproducible at
will. In contrast, sensations that are associated with “other” occur with
less regularity and in varying combinations. The sound, smell, and feel
of the parent sometimes appear promptly in response to crying, but
sometimes do not. The satisfaction that the mother or another loving
adult provides continues the process of attachment.

Emotional Development and Communication

Babies interact with increasing sophistication and range. They have an
innate ability for facial expressions that, over time, become the functional expressions of emotion (anger, joy, interest, fear, disgust, and
surprise). Infants can discriminate and imitate facial expressions, when
paired with vocalizations, of adults as well as other infants. Initiating
games (singing, hand games) increases social development. Such face-­
to-­face behavior reveals the infant’s ability to share emotional states, the
first step in the development of communication. Infants of depressed
parents show a different pattern, spending less time in coordinated
movement with their parents and making fewer efforts to reengage.
Rather than anger, they show sadness and a loss of energy when the
parents continue to be unavailable.

Implications for Parents and Pediatricians

Motor and sensory maturation makes infants at 3-­6 months exciting and
interactive. Some parents experience their 4-­month-­old child’s outward
turning as a rejection, secretly fearing that their infants no longer love
them. For most parents, this is a happy period and they may excitedly
report that they can hold conversations with their infants, taking turns
vocalizing and listening. Pediatricians share in the enjoyment, as the
baby coos, makes eye contact, and moves rhythmically. Infants who do
not show this reciprocal language and movements are at risk for autism
spectrum disorder or other developmental disabilities (see Chapters 56
and 58). If this visit does not feel joyful and relaxed, causes such as social

156 Part II u Growth, Development, and Behavior
stress, family dysfunction, parental mental illness, or problems in the
infant–parent relationship should be considered. Parents can be reassured that responding to an infant’s emotional needs cannot spoil the
infant. Giving vaccines and drawing blood while the child is seated on
the parent’s lap or nursing at the breast increases pain tolerance.

AGE 6–­12 MONTHS

With achievement of the sitting position, increased mobility, and new
skills to explore the world around them, 6-­12 month old infants show
advances in cognitive understanding and communication, and new
tensions arise in regard to attachment and separation. Infants develop
will and intentions, characteristics that most parents welcome but still
find challenging to manage.

Physical Development

Growth slows more (see Table 27.1 and Figs. 24.1 and 24.2). By the
first birthday, birthweight has tripled, length has increased by 50%,
and head circumference has increased by 10 cm (4 in). The ability to
sit unsupported (6-­7 months) and to pivot while sitting (around 9-­10
months) provides increasing opportunities to manipulate several
objects at a time and to experiment with novel combinations of objects.
These explorations are aided by the emergence of a thumb-­finger grasp
(8-­9 months) and a neat pincer grasp by 12 months. Voluntary release
emerges at 9 months. Many infants begin crawling and pulling to stand
around 8 months, followed by cruising. Some walk by 1 year. Motor
achievements correlate with increasing myelinization and cerebellar
growth. These gross motor skills expand infants’ exploratory range
and create new physical dangers, as well as opportunities for learning.
Tooth eruption occurs, usually starting with the mandibular central
incisors. Tooth development (see Table 353.1) reflects skeletal maturation and bone age, although there is wide individual variation.

Cognitive Development

The 6-­month-­old infant has discovered his hands and will soon learn to
manipulate objects. At first, everything is mouthed. In time, novel objects
are picked up, inspected, passed from hand to hand, banged, dropped,
and then mouthed. Each action represents a nonverbal idea about what
things are for (in Piagetian terms, a schema; see Chapter 19). The complexity of an infant’s play, how many different schemata are brought to
bear, is a useful index of cognitive development at this age. The pleasure,
persistence, and energy with which infants tackle these challenges suggest the existence of an intrinsic drive or mastery motivation. Mastery
behavior occurs when infants feel secure; those with less secure attachments show limited experimentation and less competence.
A major milestone is the achievement by 9 months of object permanence (constancy), the understanding that objects continue to exist,
even when not seen. At 4-­7 months of age, infants look down for a
yarn ball that has been dropped but quickly give up if it is not seen.
With object constancy, older infants persist in searching. They will find
objects hidden under a cloth or behind the examiner’s back. Peek-­a-­boo
brings unlimited pleasure as the child magically brings back the other
player. Events seem to occur as a result of the child’s own activities.

Emotional Development

The advent of object permanence corresponds with qualitative changes
in social and communicative development. Infants look back and forth
between an approaching stranger and a parent and may cling or cry
anxiously, demonstrating stranger anxiety. Separations often become
more difficult. Infants who have been sleeping through the night for
months begin to awaken regularly and cry, as though remembering
that the parents are nearby or in the next room (see Chapter 31).
A new demand for autonomy also emerges. Poor weight gain at
this age often reflects a struggle between an infant’s emerging independence and parent’s control of the feeding situation. Use of the two-­
spoon method of feeding (one for the child and one for the parent),
finger foods, and a high chair with tray table can avert potential problems. Tantrums make their first appearance as the drives for autonomy
and mastery come in conflict with parental controls and the infant’s
still-­limited abilities.

Communication

Infants at 7 months of age are adept at nonverbal communication,
expressing a range of emotions and responding to vocal tone and
facial expressions. At about 9 months of age infants become aware
that emotions can be shared between people; they show parents toys
as a way of sharing their happy feelings. Between 8 and 10 months of
age, babbling takes on a new complexity, with multisyllabic sounds
(“ba-­da-­ma”) called canonical babbling. Babies can discriminate
between languages. Infants in bilingual homes learn the characteristics and rules that govern two different languages. Social interaction
(attentive adults taking turns vocalizing with the infant) profoundly
influences the acquisition and production of new sounds. The first
true word (i.e., a sound used consistently to refer to a specific object
or person) appears in concert with an infant’s discovery of object
permanence. Picture books now provide an ideal context for verbal language acquisition. With a familiar book as a shared focus of
attention, a parent and child engage in repeated cycles of pointing
and labeling, with elaboration and feedback by the parent. Often
infants learn a gesture to communicate before the can say the word
(e.g., waving bye-­bye before saying “bye-­bye”), and there is limited
evidence that the addition of sign language may support infant
development while enhancing parent–infant communication.

Implications for Parents and Pediatricians

With the developmental reorganization that occurs around 9 months of
age, previously resolved issues of feeding and sleeping reemerge. Pediatricians can prepare parents at the 6 month visit so that these problems
can be understood as the result of developmental progress and not
regression. Parents should be encouraged to plan ahead for necessary,
and inevitable, separations (e.g., babysitter, daycare). Routine preparations may make these separations easier. Dual parent employment has
not been consistently found to be harmful or beneficial for long-­term
cognitive or social-­emotional outcomes. Introduction of a transitional
object may allow the infant to self-­comfort in the parents’ absence. The
object cannot have any potential for asphyxiation or strangulation.
Infants’ wariness of strangers often makes the 9 month examination difficult, particularly if the infant is temperamentally prone to react negatively
to unfamiliar situations. Initially, the pediatrician should avoid direct eye
contact with the child. Time spent talking with the parent and introducing
the child to a small, washable toy will be rewarded with more cooperation. The examination can be continued on the parent’s lap when feasible.
Encourage parents to read, play, and communicate with their infant.

23.1 Infant Crying and Colic
Mutiat T. Onigbanjo and Susan Feigelman
Crying or fussiness is present in all babies but reaches medical attention in about 20% of infants younger than 2 months. Although usually
a transient and normal infant behavior, crying is often associated with
parental concern and distress. On average, babies cry 2 hours per day,
peaking at 6 weeks of age. Premature infants will have peak crying at 6
weeks corrected age (Fig. 23.3). Small-­for-­gestational-­age and premature babies may be at higher risk. The peak period of infant crying usually occurs in the evenings and early part of the night. Excessive crying
or fussiness persisting longer than 3-­5 months may be associated with
behavioral problems in an older child (anxiety, aggression, hyperactivity), decreased duration of breastfeeding, or postnatal depression, but
it is uncertain which is the cause or effect. Most infants with crying/
fussiness do not have gastroesophageal reflux, lactose intolerance, constipation, or cow’s milk protein allergy.
Acute-­onset uncontrollable crying could be caused by a medical
condition. Potentially overlooked conditions to consider include corneal abrasion, tourniquet effect of a hair wrapped around a digit or

penis, occult fracture, urinary tract infection, acute abdomen including
inguinal hernia, or anomalous coronary artery. Breastfeeding mothers
should be asked about medications, drugs, and diet. Gastrointestinal
distress can result from a maternal diet high in cruciferous vegetables.
Most of the time, the etiology of a serious problem can be discovered
with a careful history and physical examination.
Crying is a normal part of neurobehavioral development. Infants have
various signals for their needs and for getting attention from a caregiver.
These behaviors progressively increase in intensity in many infants, from
changes in breathing and color, to postural and movement changes, and
then to calm vocalizations. These precry cues, if not attended to, will
eventually lead to active crying. Some infants may go directly to crying,
perhaps based on temperament; these infants may be less easily consolable, more intense, or more responsive to sensory stimuli. Management
of crying/fussiness should include teaching caregivers about precry cues
and responding to the signal for feeding in a calm, relaxed manner. If sensory overstimulation is a factor, creating a nondistracting, calm environment may help, as well as swaddling. When lack of sensory stimulation is
present, parent–infant skin-­to-­skin contact and carrying the infant may
be beneficial. In all situations, reassurance that this is both normal and
transient, with only 5% of infants persisting beyond 3 months of age,
helps the family cope. Teaching families about expectations for normal
crying behavior can reduce emergency department visits.
The emotional significance of any experience depends on both the
individual child’s temperament and the parent’s responses (see Table
19.1); differing feeding schedules produce differing reactions. Hunger
generates increasing tension; as the urgency peaks, the infant cries, the
parent offers the breast or bottle, and the tension dissipates. Infants
fed “on demand” consistently experience this link among their distress,
the arrival of the parent, and relief from hunger. Most infants fed on a
fixed schedule quickly adapt their hunger cycle to the schedule. Those
who cannot adapt, because they are temperamentally prone to irregular biologic rhythms, experience periods of unrelieved hunger as well
as unwanted feedings when they already feel full. Similarly, infants
who are fed at the parents’ convenience, with neither attention to the
infant’s hunger cues nor a fixed schedule, may not consistently experience feeding as the pleasurable reduction of tension. Infants with early
dysregulation often show increased irritability and physiologic instability (spitting, diarrhea, poor weight gain) as well as later behavioral
problems. Infants with excess crying after 4-­6 months may have neurobehavioral dysregulation and may be at higher risk of other behavior
problems (sleep, behavior, feeding).
Colic is characterized by the “rule of 3.” It occurs in a healthy, thriving
infant beginning in the second or third week of life with crying that lasts at

157

least 3 hours per day, occurs at least 3 days per week, lasts for more than 3
weeks, and resolves by 3 or 4 months of age. It is equally common in breastfed and bottle-­fed infants, although prevalence is variable (up to 20%).
There is no racial, socioeconomic status, or gender risk for colic. Colic is
a diagnosis of exclusion following a careful history and physical examination. Few cases will be found to have an organic etiology. Although all
babies have crying episodes, colicky babies cry excessively and are difficult
to settle. The fussiness is not associated with hunger or any other form
of discomfort. Colicky babies may be more reactive to the same stimulus
and may cry louder than other babies. Although crying periods are a normal developmental phenomenon, babies with colic can cause parents to
become anxious, distraught, frustrated, and sleep deprived. Mothers are
at higher risk for postpartum depression if they report inconsolable crying
episodes lasting more than 20 minutes. Depression may lead to cessation
of breastfeeding. The risk of abuse increases as frustrated parents may use
aggressive means in an attempt to quiet the child, resulting in the shaken
baby syndrome.
There is no specific treatment for colic, but practitioners should provide advice and reassurance to parents. Parents must be counseled about
the problem, the importance of implementing a series of calm, systematic
steps to soothe the infant, and having a plan for stress relief, such as time-­
out for parents and substitute caregivers. Parents can be advised that colic
is self-­limited with no adverse effects on the child. Public health programs,
such as the Period of PURPLE Crying (http://purplecrying.info/) and
Take 5 Safety Plan for Crying, are invaluable tools for parents. These programs inform parents that all babies go through periods of crying, deflecting parental guilt and self-­recrimination. Most importantly, parents are
reminded that it is better to allow the baby to cry than engage in shaking
that leads to head trauma. Although babies with colic will have inconsolable periods when there is no relief, parents can try some simple steps.
Predictable daily schedules may help, ensuring the baby has adequate
sleep. Parents should provide appropriate stimulation throughout the day
when baby is in an alert/awake period. The sleep environment should be
free of stimulation. Swaddling, rocking, white noise, and movement (e.g.,
stroller, car ride) help some babies settle. Infants who are carried by a parent show different physiologic changes than when held in a sitting position, although there is no evidence that continuous carrying is effective in
colic management. A study in a hunter-­gatherer society showed that children who are continuously carried by their mothers display similar crying
periods as those in Western societies.
Some studies have found differences in fecal microflora (dysbiosis) between babies with excess crying and controls. Results include
fewer bifidobacteria and lactobacilli and more coliform bacteria such
as Escherichia coli. None has been conclusive, however, and each study
was found to have limitations such as lack of precise inclusion criteria,
lack of blinded observers, and variability in outcome measurements.
If the child appears to have gastrointestinal symptoms, breastfeeding
mothers may try elimination of milk, beans, and cruciferous vegetables
from their diets. In allergic families, mothers may try a stricter elimination of food allergens (milk, egg, wheat, nuts, soy, and fish), although
nutritional status should be monitored. For formula-­fed infants, changing
from milk-­based to soy-­based or other lactose-­free formulas had no effect
in most studies. A protein hydrolysate formula may moderately improve
symptoms.
The cause of colic in not known, and no medical intervention has been
consistently effective. Colic has been described as a “functional gastrointestinal disorder” and has been associated with maternal migraines,
as well as later development of migraine in the child. Simethicone has
not been shown to be better than placebo. Anticholinergic medications
should not be used in infants younger than 6 months. Early studies of
probiotics look promising, but evidence is insufficient to recommend
their routine use. Among various complementary therapies, certain
herbal teas, sugar solutions, Gripe water (containing herbal supplements), chamomile and fennel extract may have benefit, but the evidence
is weak. Baby massage may be helpful, but chiropractic manipulation
should not be performed in young children. Acupuncture was effective
in one trial and singing while in utero may produce babies who cry less.

158 Part II u Growth, Development, and Behavior

The Second Year

“give me.” By 15 months, the average child points to major body parts
and uses four to six words spontaneously and correctly. Toddlers also
enjoy polysyllabic jargoning (see Tables 23.1 and 24.1) and do not seem
upset that no one understands. Most communication of wants and ideas
continues to be nonverbal (e.g., by pointing, facial expressions).

Rebecca G. Carter and Susan Feigelman

Implications for Parents and Pediatricians

Chapter 24

The second year of life is a time of rapid growth and development, particularly in the realms of social-­emotional and cognitive skills as well as
motor development. The toddler’s newly found ability to walk allows
separation and independence; however, the toddler continues to need
secure attachment to the parents. At approximately 18 months of age, the
emergence of symbolic thought and language causes a reorganization of
behavior, with implications across many developmental domains.

AGE 12–­18 MONTHS
Physical Development

Although overall rate of growth continues to decline, the toddler continues
to experience considerable brain growth and myelination in the second
year of life, resulting in an increase in head circumference of 2 cm over
the year (Figs. 24.1 and 24.2). Toddlers have relatively short legs and long
torsos, with exaggerated lumbar lordosis and protruding abdomens.
Most children begin to walk independently at about 12-­15 months of
age. Early walking is not associated with advanced development in other
domains. Infants initially toddle with a wide-­based gait, with the knees
bent and the arms flexed at the elbow; the entire torso rotates with each
stride; the toes may point in or out, and the feet strike the floor flat. The
appearance is that of genu varum (bowleg). Subsequent refinement leads
to greater steadiness and energy efficiency. After several months of practice, the center of gravity shifts back and the torso stabilizes, while the
knees extend and the arms swing at the sides for balance. The feet are held
in better alignment, and the child is able to stop, pivot, and stoop without
toppling over (see Chapters 713 and 714).

Cognitive Development

Exploration of the environment increases in parallel with improved
dexterity (reaching, grasping, releasing) and mobility. Learning follows
the precepts of Piaget’s sensorimotor stage (see Chapter 19). Toddlers
manipulate objects in novel ways to create interesting effects, such as
stacking blocks or filling and dumping buckets. Playthings are also
more likely to be used for their intended purposes (combs for hair, cups
for drinking). Imitation of parents and older siblings or other children
is an important mode of learning. Make-­believe play (symbolic play)
centers on the child’s own body, such as pretending to drink from an
empty cup (Table 24.1; see also Table 23.1).

Emotional Development

Infants who are approaching the developmental milestone of taking their
first steps may be irritable. Once they start walking, their predominant
mood changes markedly. Toddlers are often elated with their new ability
and with the power to control the distance between themselves and their
parents. Exploring toddlers will orbit around their trusted adults, moving
away and then returning for a reassuring touch before moving away again.
A child with secure attachment will use the trusted adult as a secure base
from which to explore independently. Proud of their accomplishments,
the child illustrates Erikson’s stage of autonomy and separation (see
Chapter 19). The toddler who is overly controlled and discouraged from
active exploration may feel doubt, shame, anger, and insecurity. All children will experience tantrums, reflecting their inability to delay gratification, suppress or displace anger, or verbally communicate their emotional
states. Children may form secure attachments with parents as well as other
trusted adults, thereby reinforcing the value of quality childcare if parents
are employed out of the home.

Linguistic Development

Receptive language precedes expressive language. By the time infants
speak their first words around 12 months of age, they already respond
appropriately to several simple statements, such as “no,” “bye-­bye,” and

Parents who cannot recall any other milestone tend to remember when
their child began to walk, perhaps because of the symbolic significance
of walking as an act of independence and because of the new demands
that the ambulating toddler places on the parent. All toddlers should be
encouraged to explore their environment; however, a child’s ability to wander out of sight also increases the risks of injury and the need for supervision, making recommendations regarding childproofing an integral focus
of physician visits.
Parents must understand the importance of exploration. Rather than
limiting movement, parents should place toddlers in safe environments
or substitute one activity for another. In the office setting, many toddlers
are comfortable exploring the examination room, but cling to the parents under the stress of the examination. Children who become more,
not less, distressed in their parents’ arms or who avoid their parents at
times of stress may be insecurely attached. Young children who, when
distressed, turn to strangers rather than parents for comfort are particularly worrisome. Children raised in environments with extreme and/or
chronic levels of stress (toxic stress) have increased vulnerability to disease that continues into adulthood (see Chapter 1). These effects can be
mediated by fostering elements of resiliency including introduction of
a supportive or encouraging trusted adult. The conflicts between independence and security manifest in issues of discipline, temper tantrums,
toilet training, and changing feeding behaviors. Parents should be counseled on these matters within the framework of normal development.
Parents may express concern about poor food intake as growth
slows. The growth chart should provide reassurance. Many children
still take two daytime naps, although the duration steadily decreases
and may start to condense to one longer nap (see Fig. 23.2).

AGE 18–24 MONTHS
Physical Development

Motor development during this period is reflected in improvements in
balance and agility and the emergence of running and stair climbing.
Height and weight increase at a steady rate during this year, with a gain
of 5 in and 5 lb. By 24 months, children are about half their ultimate
adult height. Head growth slows slightly, with 85% of adult head circumference achieved by age 2 years, leaving only an additional 5 cm (2
in) gain over the next few years (see Fig. 24.1 and Table 27.1).

Cognitive Development

At approximately 18 mo of age, several cognitive changes coalesce, marking the conclusion of the sensorimotor period. These can be observed
during self-­initiated play. Object permanence, which was first demonstrated around 9 months of age (see Chapter 23), is now firmly established; toddlers anticipate where an object will end up, even though the
object was not visible while it was being moved. Cause and effect are better understood, and toddlers demonstrate flexibility in problem solving
(e.g., using a stick to obtain a toy that is out of reach, figuring out how to
wind a mechanical toy). Symbolic transformations in play are no longer
tied to the toddler’s own body; thus a doll can be “fed” from an empty
plate. As with the reorganization that occurs at 9 months (see Chapter
23), the cognitive changes at 18 months correlate with important changes
in the emotional and linguistic domains (see Table 24.1).

Emotional Development

The relative independence of the preceding half-­year often gives way to
increased clinginess at about 18 months. This stage, described as “rapprochement,” may be a reaction to growing awareness of the possibility
of separation. Many parents report that they cannot go anywhere without
having a small child attached to them. Separation anxiety will manifest
at bedtime. Many children use a special blanket or stuffed toy as a transitional object, which functions as a symbol of the absent parent. The transitional object remains important until the transition to symbolic thought

has been completed and the symbolic presence of the parent fully internalized. Despite the attachment to the parent, the child’s use of “no” is a way of
declaring independence. Individual differences in temperament, in both
the child and the parents, play a critical role in determining the balance of
conflict vs cooperation in the parent–child relationship. As effective language emerges, conflicts often become less frequent.
Self-­conscious awareness and internalized standards of behavior first
appear at this age. Toddlers looking in a mirror will, for the first time, reach
for their own face rather than the mirror image if they notice something
unusual on their nose. They begin to recognize when toys are broken
and may hand them to their parents to fix. Language becomes a means
of impulse control, early reasoning, and connection between ideas. When
tempted to touch a forbidden object, they may tell themselves “no, no.”
This is the very beginning of the formation of a conscience. The fact that
they often go on to touch the object anyway demonstrates the relative
weakness of internalized inhibitions at this stage.

Linguistic Development

Perhaps the most dramatic developments in this period are linguistic.
Labeling of objects coincides with the advent of symbolic thought. After
the realization occurs that words can stand for objects or ideas, a child’s
vocabulary grows from 10-­15 words at 18 months to between 50 and 100
at 2 years. After acquiring a vocabulary of about 50 words, toddlers begin
to combine them to make simple sentences, marking the beginning of
grammar. At this stage, toddlers understand two-­step commands, such
as “Give me the ball and then get your shoes.” Language also gives the toddler a sense of control over the surroundings, as in “night-­night” or “bye-­
bye.” The emergence of verbal language marks the end of the sensorimotor
period. As toddlers learn to use symbols to express ideas and solve problems, the need for cognition based on direct sensation and motor manipulation wanes.

Implications for Parents and Pediatricians

With children’s increasing mobility, physical limits on their explorations
become less effective; words become increasingly important for behavior
control as well as cognition. Children with delayed language acquisition
often have greater behavior problems and frustrations due to problems
with communication. Language development is facilitated when parents
and caregivers use clear, simple sentences; ask questions; pause to allow
time to process and generate verbal responses and respond to children’s
incomplete sentences and gestural communication with the appropriate
words. Television and distracted screen-­time viewing, as well as television
as background noise, decreases parent–child verbal interactions, whereas
looking at picture books and engaging the child in two-­way conversations stimulates language development. In the world of constant access to
tablets, phones, and screens, parents and children have more distractions
from direct language engagement. Even educational programing needs to
be limited on screens to reinforce face-­to-­face contact with caregivers during language acquisition; solo media use should be avoided in this age. As
an introduction to this topic, the provider can ask “What are your child’s
favorite activities?” and “What activities do you like to do with your child?”
Performing most of the physical examination in the parent’s lap
may help allay fears of separation and stranger anxiety. Avoid direct
eye contact initially and introduce all tools used during the exam
such as the otoscope for the patient to explore before use. Save the
more invasive portions of the exam to the end (i.e., ears, throat, etc.).
Pediatricians can help parents understand the resurgence of problems with separation and the appearance of a transitional object as
developmental phenomenon. Methods of discipline should be discussed; effective alternatives to corporal punishment will usually be
appreciated (see Chapter 20 and Tables 20.3 and 20.4). Helping parents to understand and adapt to their children’s different temperamental styles can constitute an important intervention (see Table
19.1). Developing daily routines is helpful to all children at this age.
Rigidity in those routines reflects a need for mastery over a changing
environment. Parents should also institute systems to help prepare
their child during times of transition from one activity or setting to
another to help foster a sense of trust and communication.

164 Part II u Growth, Development, and Behavior

Chapter 25

The Preschool Years
Rebecca G. Carter and Susan Feigelman
The emergence of language and exposure of children to an expanding social sphere represent the critical milestones for children age 2-­5
years. As toddlers, children learn to walk away and come back to the
secure adult. As preschoolers, they explore emotional separation, alternating between stubborn opposition and cheerful compliance, between
bold exploration and clinging dependence. Increasing time spent in
classrooms and playgrounds strengthens a child’s ability to adapt to
new rules and relationships. Emboldened by their growing array of
new skills and accomplishments, preschool children also are increasingly cognizant of the constraints imposed on them by the adult world
and their own limited abilities.

STRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRAIN

The preschool brain experiences dramatic changes in its anatomic and
physiologic characteristics, with increases in cortical area, decreases in
cortical thickness, and changing cortical volume. These changes are not
uniform across the brain and vary by region. Gray and white matter tissue properties change dramatically, including diffusion properties in the
major cerebral fiber tracts. Dramatic increases occur in brain metabolic
demands. In general, more brain regions are required in younger than
in older children to complete the same cognitive task. This duplication has been interpreted as a form of “scaffolding,” which is discarded
with increasing age. The preschool brain is characterized by growth and
expansion of synapses that will be followed in later years by “pruning.”

PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT

Somatic and brain growth slows by the end of the second year of life,
with corresponding decreases in nutritional requirements and appetite,
and the emergence of “picky” eating habits (see Table 27.1). Increases
of approximately 2 kg (4-­5 lb) in weight and 7-­8 cm (2-­3 in) in height
per year are expected. Birthweight quadruples by 2.5 years of age. An
average 4 year old weighs 40 lb and is 40 in tall. The head will grow
only an additional 5-­6 cm between ages 3 and 18 years. Current growth
charts, with growth parameters, can be found on the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention website (http://www.cdc.gov/growt
hcharts/) and in Chapter 27. Children with early adiposity rebound
(increase in body mass index) are at increased risk for adult obesity.
The preschooler has genu valgum (knock-­knees) and mild pes planus (flatfoot). The torso slims as the legs lengthen. Growth of sexual
organs is commensurate with somatic growth. Physical energy peaks,
and the need for sleep declines to 11-­13 hours per 24 hours, with the
child eventually dropping the nap (see Fig. 23.2). Visual acuity reaches
20/30 by age 4 years and 20/20 by school age. All 20 primary teeth have
erupted by 3 years of age (see Chapter 353).
Most children walk with a mature gait and run steadily before the
end of their third year (see Table 24.1). Beyond this basic level, there
is wide variation in ability as the range of motor activities expands
to include throwing, catching, and kicking balls; riding on bicycles;
climbing on playground structures; dancing; and other complex pattern behaviors. Stylistic features of gross motor activity, such as tempo,
intensity, and cautiousness, also vary significantly. Although toddlers
may walk with different styles, toe walking should not persist.
The effects of such individual differences on cognitive and emotional
development depend in part on the demands of the social environment
and alignment with their caregivers’ temperaments. Energetic, coordinated children may thrive emotionally with parents or teachers who
encourage physical activity; lower-­energy, more cerebral children may
thrive with adults who value quiet play.
Handedness is usually established by the third year. Frustration
may result from inability to properly teach skills based on child’s hand

preference. Variations in fine motor development reflect both individual proclivities and different opportunities for learning. Children
who are restricted from drawing with crayons, for example, develop a
mature pencil grasp later.
Bowel and bladder control emerge during this period, with “readiness” for toileting having large individual and cultural variation.
Females tend to potty “train” faster and earlier than males. Bed-­wetting
is common up to age 5 years (see Chapter 580). Many children master
toileting with ease, particularly once they are able to verbalize their
bodily needs. For others, toilet training can involve a protracted power
struggle. Refusal to defecate in the toilet or potty is relatively common,
associated with constipation, and can lead to parental frustration.
Defusing the issue with a temporary cessation of training (and a return
to diapers) often allows toilet mastery to proceed. Parents should focus
on positive reinforcement and avoid negative reactions during the toilet training process.

Implications for Parents and Pediatricians

The normal decrease in appetite at this age may cause parental concern
about nutrition; growth charts should reassure parents that the child’s
intake is adequate. Children normally modulate their food intake to
match their somatic needs according to feelings of hunger and satiety. Daily intake fluctuates, at times widely, but intake over a week is
relatively stable. Parents should provide a predictable eating schedule,
with three meals and two snacks per day, allowing the child to choose
how much to eat. This will avoid power struggles and allows the child
to respond to satiety cues. However, it is important to obtain thorough
diet histories for children at this age to advise parents about healthy
choices and encourage physical activity to decrease long-­term obesity
risks and improve learning and cognitive development.
Highly active children face increased risks of injury, and parents
should be counseled about safety precautions. Parental concerns
about possible hyperactivity may reflect inappropriate expectations,
heightened fears, or true overactivity. Children who engage in ongoing
impulsive activity with no apparent regard for personal safety or those
harming others on a regular basis should be evaluated further.
Assessment of motor skills must take into account a child’s exposure history. Before diagnosing a motor delay based on screening tools,
pediatricians should explore any limitations to a child’s exposure and
encourage parents to seek opportunities to work on these skills. Children should be followed closely at this age; referral to therapies should
be pursued when true delays are identified given the proven benefits of
early intervention.

LANGUAGE, COGNITION, AND PLAY

These three domains all involve symbolic function, a mode of dealing
with the world that emerges during the preschool period.

Language

Our understanding of the acquisition of language is evolving. Preschool
children command significant computational skills and understanding
of statistical patterns that allow them to learn about both language and
causation. The 2-­and 3-­year-­old child employs frequency distributions
to identify phonetic units distinguishing words in his or her native language from other languages.
Language development occurs most rapidly between 2 and 5 years
of age. Vocabulary increases from 50-­100 words to more than 2,000.
Sentence structure advances from telegraphic phrases (“baby cry”)
to sentences incorporating all the major grammatical components
(see Chapter 53). As a rule of thumb, between ages 2 and 5 years,
the number of words the child puts in a typical sentence should, at a
minimum, equal the child’s age (2 by age 2 years, 3 by age 3 years, and
so on). By 21-­24 months, most children are using possessives (“my
ball”), progressives (the “-­ing” construction, as in “I playing”), questions, and negatives. By age 4 years, most children can count to 4 and
use the past tense; by age 5 years, they can use the future tense. Young
children do not use figurative speech; they will comprehend only the
literal meaning of words. Referring to an object as “light as a feather”
may produce a quizzical look on a child.

Chapter 25 u The Preschool Years
It is important to distinguish between speech (the production of
intelligible sounds) and language, which refers to the underlying mental act. Language includes both expressive and receptive functions.
Receptive language (understanding) varies less in its rate of acquisition than does expressive language; therefore it has greater prognostic
importance (see Chapters 28 and 53).
Language acquisition depends critically on environmental input.
Key determinants include the amount and variety of speech directed
toward children and the frequency with which adults ask questions
and encourage verbalization. Children raised in poverty typically perform lower on measures of language development than children from
economically advantaged families, who tend to be exposed to many
more words in the preschool period. Interventions aimed at increasing
access to books in the home can temper these differences and improve
language and pre-­reading skills in the preschool child.
Although experience influences the rate of language development,
many linguists believe that the basic mechanism for language learning is “hard-­wired” in the brain. Children do not simply imitate adult
speech; they abstract the complex rules of grammar from the ambient
language, generating implicit hypotheses. Evidence for the existence of
such implicit rules comes from analysis of grammatical errors, such as
the overgeneralized use of “-­s” to signify the plural and “-­ed” to signify
the past (“We seed lots of mouses.”).
Language is linked to both cognitive and emotional development.
Language delays may be the first indication of an intellectual disability,
autism spectrum disorder, or child neglect or maltreatment. Language
plays a critical part in the regulation of behavior through internalized “private speech” in which a child repeats adult prohibitions, first
audibly and then mentally. Language also allows children to express
feelings, such as anger or frustration, without acting them out; consequently, language-­delayed children may show higher rates of tantrums
and other externalizing behaviors.
Preschool language development lays the foundation for later success in school. Approximately 35% of U.S. children may enter school
lacking the language skills that are the prerequisites for acquiring literacy. Children from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds have an increased risk of school problems, making early
detection, along with referral and enrichment in programs such as
Head Start, highly crucial for later development. Although children
typically learn to read and write in elementary school, critical foundations for literacy are established during the preschool years. Through
repeated early exposure to written words, children learn about the uses
of writing (telling stories or sending messages) and about its form (left
to right, top to bottom). Early errors in writing, like errors in speaking, reveal that literacy acquisition is an active process involving the
generation and revision of hypotheses. Bilingual children may initially
appear to lag behind their monolingual peers in acquiring language.
They learn the differing rules governing both languages, and generally
have the same number of total words between the languages. Bilingual
children do not follow the same course of language development as
monolingual children, but rather create a different system of language
cues. Several cognitive advantages have been repeatedly demonstrated
among bilingual compared to monolingual children.
Picture books have a special role in familiarizing young children
with the printed word and in the development of verbal language.
Children’s vocabulary and receptive language improve when their
parents or caregivers consistently read to them. Reading aloud with
a young child is an interactive process in which a parent repeatedly
focuses the child’s attention on a particular picture, asks questions,
and then gives the child feedback (dialogic reading). The elements of
shared attention, active participation, immediate feedback, repetition,
and graduated difficulty make such routines ideal for language learning. Programs in which physicians provide books to preschool children
have shown improvement in language skills among the children (e.g.,
Reach Out and Read).
The period of rapid language acquisition is also when developmental
dysfluency and stuttering are most likely to emerge (see Chapter 53.1);
these can be traced to activation of the cortical motor, sensory, and
cerebellar areas. Common difficulties include pauses and repetitions of

165

initial sounds. Stress or excitement exacerbates these difficulties, which
generally resolve on their own. Although 5% of preschool children will
stutter, it will resolve in 80% of those children by age 8 years. Children with stuttering should be referred for evaluation if it is severe,
persistent, or associated with anxiety, or if parental concern is elicited.
Treatment includes guidance to parents to reduce pressures associated
with speaking.

Cognition

The preschool period corresponds to Piaget’s preoperational (prelogical) stage, characterized by magical thinking, egocentrism, and
thinking that is dominated by perception, not abstraction (see Table
19.2). Magical thinking includes confusing coincidence with causality, animism (attributing motivations to inanimate objects and events),
and unrealistic beliefs about the power of wishes. A child might believe
that people cause it to rain by carrying umbrellas, that the sun goes
down because it is tired, or that feeling resentment toward a sibling can
actually make that sibling sick. Egocentrism refers to a child’s inability to take another’s point of view and does not connote selfishness.
A child might try to comfort an adult who is upset by bringing the
adult a favorite stuffed animal. After 2 years of age, the child develops
a concept of herself or himself as an individual and senses the need to
feel “whole.”
Piaget demonstrated the dominance of perception over logic. In
one experiment, water is poured back and forth between a tall, thin
vase and a low, wide dish, and children are asked which container
has more water. Typically, preschool-­age children choose the one that
looks larger (usually the tall vase), even when the examiner points out
that no water has been added or taken away. Such misunderstandings
reflect young children’s developing hypotheses about the nature of the
world, as well as their difficulty in attending simultaneously to multiple
aspects of a situation. Preschool children also are able to understand
causal relationships; this adds to our understanding of the ability of
preschool children to engage in abstract thinking (see Chapter 19).
Imitation, central to the learning experience of preschool children,
is a complex act because of differences in the size of the operators (the
adult and the child), different levels of dexterity, and even different outcomes. A child who watches an adult unsuccessfully attempt a simple
act (unscrew a lid) will imitate the action, but often with the intended
outcome and not the demonstrated (failed) outcome. Thus “imitation”
goes beyond the mere repetition of observed movements.
By age 3 years, children have self-­identified their sex and are actively
seeking understanding of the meaning of gender identification. There
is a developmental progression from rigidity (males and female have
strict gender roles) in the early preschool years to a more flexible realistic understanding (males and females can have a variety of interests
that are not gender specific). Parents can facilitate this flexibility by
eliminating gender-­based expectations and expanding play options.

Play

Play involves learning, physical activity, socialization with peers, and
practicing adult roles. Play increases in complexity and imagination,
from simple imitation of common experiences, such as shopping and
putting baby to bed (2 or 3 years of age), to more extended scenarios
involving singular events, such as going to the zoo or going on a trip
(3 or 4 years of age), to the creation of scenarios that have only been
imagined, such as flying to the moon (4 or 5 years of age). By age 3
years, cooperative play is seen in activities such as building a tower of
blocks together; later, more structured role-­play activity, as in playing
house, is seen. Play also becomes increasingly governed by rules, from
early rules about asking (rather than taking) and sharing (2 or 3 years
of age), to rules that change from moment to moment, according to
the desires of the players (4 and 5 years of age), to the beginning of the
recognition of rules as relatively immutable (5 years of age). Electronic
forms of play (games) are best if interactive and educational and should
remain limited in duration.
Play also allows for resolution of conflicts and anxiety and for creative outlets. Children can vent anger safely (reprimanding a doll), take
on superpowers (dinosaur and superhero play), and obtain things that

166 Part II u Growth, Development, and Behavior
are denied in real life (an imaginary friend or stuffed animal). Creativity is particularly apparent in drawing, painting, and other artistic
activities. Themes and emotions that emerge in a child’s drawings often
reflect the emotional issues of greatest importance for the child.
Difficulty distinguishing fantasy from reality colors a child’s perception of what the child views in the media, through programming and
advertising. Twenty-­five percent of young children have a television
set or tablet in their bedroom; screen time in the bedroom is associated with more hours of watching. The number of hours that most
preschoolers watch screens exceeds guidelines (1 hr/day for 2-­5 year
olds). Interactive quality educational programming in which children
develop social relationships with the characters can increase learning
if paired with adult interaction around the storyline. Exposure to commercial programming with violent content is associated with behavior
problems, and because children younger than 8 years are not able to
comprehend the concept of persuasive intent, they are more vulnerable
to advertising.

Implications for Parents and Pediatricians

The significance of language as a target for assessment and intervention
cannot be overestimated, because of its central role as an indicator of
cognitive and emotional development and a key factor in behavioral
regulation and later school success. As language emerges, parents can
support emotional development by using words that describe the child’s
feeling states (“You sound angry right now”) and urging the child to
use words to express rather than act out feelings. Active imaginations
will come into play when children offer explanations for misbehavior.
A parent’s best way of dealing with untruths is to address the event, not
the child, and have the child participate in “making things right.”
Parents should have a regular time each day for reading or looking
at books with their children. Programs such as Reach Out and Read,
in which clinicians give out picture books along with appropriate guidance during primary care visits, have been effective in increasing reading aloud and thereby promoting language development, particularly
in lower-­income families. TV and similar media should be limited to 1
hr/day of quality programming for children age 2-­5 years, and parents
should be watching the programs with their children and debriefing
their young children afterward. At-­risk children, particularly those living in poverty, can better meet future school challenges if they have
early high-­quality child care and learning experiences (e.g., Head Start).
Preoperational thinking constrains how children understand experiences of illness and treatment. Children begin to understand that
bodies have “insides” and “outsides.” Children should be given simple,
concrete explanations for medical procedures and given some control
over procedures if possible. Children should be reassured that they are
not to blame when receiving a vaccine or venipuncture, and parents
should be discouraged from making threats about needles if their child
is not cooperating with the exam. An adhesive bandage will help to
make the body “whole” again in a child’s mind.
The active imagination that fuels play and the magical, animist
thinking characteristic of preoperational cognition can also generate intense fears. More than 80% of parents report at least one fear in
their preschool children. Refusal to take baths or to sit on the toilet
may arise from the fear of being washed or flushed away, reflecting a
child’s immature appreciation of relative size. Attempts to demonstrate
rationally that there are no monsters in the closet often fail, inasmuch
as the fear arises from preoperational thinking. However, this same
thinking allows parents to be endowed with magical powers that can
banish the monsters with “monster spray” or a night-­light. Parents
should acknowledge the fears, offer reassurance and a sense of security,
and give the child some sense of control over the situation. Use of the
Draw-­a-­Person, in which a child is asked to draw the best person the
child can, may help elucidate a child’s viewpoint.

Emotional and Moral Development

Emotional challenges facing preschool children include accepting limits while maintaining a sense of self-­direction, reigning in aggressive
and sexual impulses, and interacting with a widening circle of adults
and peers. At 2 years of age, behavioral limits are predominantly

external; by 5 years of age, these controls need to be internalized if a
child is to function in a typical classroom. Success in achieving this
goal relies on prior emotional development, particularly the ability to
use internalized images of trusted adults to provide a secure environment in times of stress. The love a child feels for important adults is the
main incentive for the development of self-­control.
Children learn what behaviors are acceptable and how much power
they wield vis-­à-­vis important adults by testing limits. Limit testing
increases when it elicits attention, even though that attention is often
negative, and when limits are inconsistent. Testing often arouses parental anger or inappropriate solicitude as a child struggles to separate, and
it gives rise to a corresponding parental challenge: letting go. Excessively tight limits can undermine a child’s sense of initiative, whereas
overly loose limits can provoke anxiety in a child who feels that no one
is in control.
Control is a central issue. Young children cannot control many
aspects of their lives, including where they go, how long they stay, and
what they take home from the store. They are also prone to lose internal
control, that is, to have temper tantrums. Fear, overtiredness, hunger,
inconsistent expectations, or physical discomfort can also evoke tantrums. Tantrums normally appear toward the end of the first year of life
and peak in prevalence between 2 and 4 years of age. Tantrums lasting
more than 15 minutes or regularly occurring more than three times
per day may reflect underlying medical, emotional, developmental, or
social problems. Parents likely will not be able to reason or teach in the
context of an active tantrum, and should offer emotional support during these times, sticking to short and concise explanations (“I can’t let
you hit”). Lessons about their behavior or discussions about strategies
for future challenges should be delayed until the child is calm and able
to engage.
Preschool children normally experience complicated feelings toward
their parents that can include strong attachment and possessiveness
toward the parent of the opposite sex, jealousy and resentment of the other
parent, and fear that these negative feelings might lead to abandonment.
These emotions, most of which are beyond a child’s ability to comprehend
or verbalize, often find expression in highly labile moods. The resolution
of complicated feelings (a process extending over years) involves a child’s
unspoken decision to identify with the parents rather than compete with
them. Play and language foster the development of emotional controls by
allowing children to express emotions and role-­play.
Curiosity about genitals and adult sexual organs is normal, as is
masturbation. Excessive masturbation interfering with normal activity, acting out sexual intercourse, extreme modesty, or mimicry of
adult seductive behavior all suggest the possibility of sexual abuse or
inappropriate exposure (see Chapter 17.1). Modesty appears gradually
between 4 and 6 years of age, with wide variations among cultures and
families. Parents should begin to teach children about “private” body
areas before school entry.
Moral thinking is constrained by a child’s cognitive level and language
abilities but develops as the child builds their identity with trusted adults.
Beginning before the second birthday, the child’s sense of right and
wrong stems from the desire to earn adult approval and avoid negative
consequences. The child’s impulses are tempered by external forces; the
child has not yet internalized societal rules or a sense of justice and fairness. Over time, as the child internalizes parental admonitions, words are
substituted for aggressive behaviors. Finally, the child accepts personal
responsibility. Actions will be viewed by damage caused, not by intent.
Empathic responses to others’ distress arise during the second year of
life, but the ability to consider another child’s point of view remains limited throughout this period. In keeping with a child’s inability to focus on
more than one aspect of a situation at a time, fairness is taken to mean
equal treatment, regardless of circumstance. A 4 year old will acknowledge the importance of taking turns but will complain if he or she “didn’t
get enough time.” Rules tend to be absolute, with guilt assigned for bad
outcomes, regardless of intentions.

Implications for Parents and Pediatricians

The importance of the preschooler’s sense of control over his or her
body and surroundings have implications for practice. Preparing the

patient by letting the child know how the visit will proceed is reassuring. Tell the child what will happen, but do not ask permission unless
you are willing to deal with a “no” answer. A brief introduction to “private parts” is warranted before the genital examination.
The visit of the 4 or 5 year old should be entertaining, because of the
child’s ability to communicate, as well as the child’s natural curiosity. Physicians should realize that all children are occasionally difficult. Guidance emphasizing appropriate expectations for behavioral and emotional
development and acknowledging normal parental feelings of anger, guilt,
and confusion should be part of all visits at this time. Parents should
be queried about daily routines and their expectations of child behavior.
Providing children with acceptable choices (all options being acceptable to the parent) and encouraging independence in self-­care activities
(feeding, dressing, and bathing) will reduce conflicts.
Although some cultures condone the use of physical punishment for
disciplining of young children, it is not a consistently effective means
of behavioral control (Chapter 20). As children habituate to repeated
spanking, parents have to spank ever harder to achieve the desired
response, increasing the risk of serious injury. Sufficiently harsh punishment may acutely inhibit undesired behaviors, but at great long-­
term psychologic cost. Children may mimic the physical punishment
that they receive; children who are spanked will have more aggressive
behaviors later. Whereas spanking is the use of force, externally applied,
to produce behavior change, discipline is the process that allows the
child to internalize controls on behavior. Alternative discipline strategies should be offered, such as the “countdown” for transitions along
with consistent limit setting, “time-­outs” and “time-­ins” (fun activities
with caregiver present and interacting), clear communication of rules,
and frequent approval with positive reinforcement of productive play
and behavior (see Chapter 20 and Tables 20.3 and 20.4). Punishment
should be immediate, specific to the behavior, and time limited. Time-­
out for approximately 1 minute per year of age is very effective if children
are getting sufficient time in. A kitchen timer or digital phone alarm
allows the parent to step back from the situation; the child is free when
the timer rings. Although one strategy might not work for all children
uniformly, consistency is integral to healthy learning and growth.

Growth of the midface and lower face occurs gradually. Loss of deciduous (baby) teeth is a more dramatic sign of maturation, beginning
around 6 years of age. Replacement with adult teeth occurs at a rate of
about four per year, so that by age 9 years, children will have eight permanent incisors and four permanent molars. Premolars erupt by 11-­12
years of age (see Chapter 353). Lymphoid tissues hypertrophy and reach
maximal size, often giving rise to impressive tonsils and adenoids.
Muscular strength, coordination, and stamina increase progressively,
as does the ability to perform complex movements, such as dancing or
shooting baskets. Such higher-­order motor skills are the result of both
maturation and training; the degree of accomplishment reflects wide
variability in innate skill, interest, and opportunity.
Physical fitness has declined among school-­age children. Sedentary
habits at this age are associated with increased lifetime risk of obesity,
cardiovascular disease, lower academic achievement, and lower self-­
esteem. The number of overweight children and the degree of overweight have been increasing (see Chapter 65). Only 15% of middle and
junior high schools require physical education classes at least three
days per week. One quarter of youth do not engage in any free-­time
physical activity, despite the recommendation for at least 1 hour of
physical activity per day.
Perceptions of body image develop early during this period; children as young as 5 and 6 years may express dissatisfaction with their
body image; by ages 8 and 9 years many of these youth report trying
to diet, often using ill-­advised regimens. Loss-­of-­control (binge) eating
occurs among approximately 6% of children at this age.
Before puberty the sensitivity of the hypothalamus and pituitary
changes, leading to increased gonadotropin synthesis. Interest in
gender differences and sexual behavior increases progressively until
puberty. Although this is a period when sexual drives are limited, masturbation is common, and children may be interested in differences
between genders. Rates of maturation differ by geography, ethnicity,
and country. Sexual maturity occurs earlier for both sexes in the United
States. Differences in maturation rates have implications for differing
expectations of others based on sexual maturation.

Middle childhood is generally a time of excellent health. However,
children have variable sizes, shapes, and abilities. Children of this age
compare themselves with others, eliciting feelings about their physical
attributes and abilities. Fears of being “abnormal” can lead to avoidance
of situations in which physical differences might be revealed, such as
gym class or medical examinations. However, all children, including
those with disabilities, should participate in gym classes. Those with
physical disabilities may face special stresses; medical, social, and psychologic risks tend to occur together.
Children should be asked about risk factors for obesity. Participation in physical activity, including organized sports or other organized
activities, can foster skill, teamwork, and fitness as well as a sense of
accomplishment, but pressure to compete when the activity is no longer enjoyable has negative effects. Counseling on establishing healthy
eating habits and limited screen time should be given to all families.
Prepubertal children should not engage in high-­stress, high-­impact
sports, such as power lifting or tackle football, because skeletal immaturity increases the risk of injury and concussions may have long-­term
sequelae (see Chapter 729).

Chapter 26

Middle Childhood
Mutiat T. Onigbanjo and Susan Feigelman
Middle childhood (6-­11 years of age) is the period in which children
increasingly separate from parents and seek acceptance from teachers,
other adults, and peers. Children begin to feel under pressure to conform to the style and ideals of the peer group. Self-­esteem becomes a
central issue, as children develop the cognitive ability to consider their
own self-­evaluations and their perception of how others see them. For
the first time, they are judged according to their ability to produce
socially valued outputs, such as getting good grades, playing a musical
instrument, or hitting home runs.

PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT

Growth occurs discontinuously, in three to six irregularly timed spurts
each year, but varies both within and among individuals. Growth during
the period averages 3-­3.5 kg (6.6-­7.7 lb) and 6-­7 cm (2.4-­2.8 in) per year
(Fig. 26.1). The head grows only 2 cm in circumference throughout the
entire period, reflecting a slowing of brain growth. Myelination continues into adolescence, with peak gray matter at 12-­14 years. Body habitus
is more erect than previously, with long legs compared with the torso.

Implications for Parents and Pediatricians

COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT

The thinking of early elementary school-­age children differs qualitatively from that of preschool children. In place of the magical, egocentric, and perception-­
bound cognition of preschool children,
school-­age children increasingly apply rules based on observable phenomena, factor in multiple dimensions and points of view, and interpret their perceptions using physical laws. Piaget documented this shift
from preoperational to concrete (logical) operations (see Chapter 19).
When 5 year olds watch a ball of clay being rolled into a snake, they
might insist that the snake has “more” because it is longer. In contrast,
7 year olds typically reply that the ball and the snake must weigh the
same because nothing has been added or taken away or because the

snake is both longer and thinner. This cognitive reorganization occurs
at different rates in different contexts. In the context of social interactions with siblings, young children often demonstrate an ability to
understand alternate points of view long before they demonstrate that
ability in their thinking about the physical world. Understanding time
and space constructs occurs in the later part of this period.
The concept of school readiness has evolved. The American Academy
of Pediatrics recommends following an “interactional relational” model in
which the focus is on the child, the environment, and the resulting interactions. This model explicitly asserts that all children can learn and that the
educational process is reciprocal between the child and the school. It is
developmentally based, recognizing the importance of early experiences
for later development. Rather than delaying school entry, high-­quality
early-­education programs may be the key to ultimate school success.
School makes increasing cognitive demands on the child. Mastery
of the elementary curriculum requires that many perceptual, cognitive, and language processes work efficiently (Table 26.1), and children
are expected to attend to many inputs at once. The first 2-­3 years of
elementary school are devoted to acquiring the fundamentals: reading,
writing, and basic mathematics skills. By third grade, children need to
be able to sustain attention through a 45-­minute period, and the curriculum requires more complex tasks. The goal of reading a paragraph
is no longer to decode the words, but to understand the content; the
goal of writing is no longer spelling or penmanship, but composition.
The volume of work increases along with the complexity.
Cognitive abilities interact with a wide array of attitudinal and emotional factors in determining classroom performance. These factors
include external rewards (eagerness to please adults and approval from
peers) and internal rewards (competitiveness, willingness to work for a
delayed reward, belief in one’s abilities, and ability to risk trying when
success is not ensured). Success predisposes to success, whereas failure impacts self-­esteem and reduces self-­efficacy, diminishing a child’s
willingness to take future risks.

Children’s intellectual activity extends beyond the classroom. Beginning
in the third or fourth grade, children increasingly enjoy strategy games and
wordplay (puns and insults) that exercise their growing cognitive and linguistic mastery. Many become experts on subjects of their own choosing,
such as sports trivia, or develop hobbies, such as special card collections.
Others become avid readers or take on artistic pursuits. Whereas board
and card games were once the usual leisure-­time activity of youth, video,
computer, and other electronic games currently fill this need.

Implications for Parents and Pediatricians

Pediatricians have an important role in preparing their patients for
school entrance by promoting health through immunizations, adequate
nutrition, appropriate recreation, and screening for physical, developmental, and cognitive disorders. The American Academy of Pediatrics
recommends that pediatric providers promote the “5 Rs” of early education: (1) reading as a daily family activity; (2) rhyming, playing, and
cuddling together; (3) routines and regular times for meals, play, and
sleep; (4) reward through praise for successes; and (5) reciprocal nurturing relationships.
Concrete operations allow children to understand simple explanations for illnesses and necessary treatments, although they may revert
to prelogical thinking when under stress. A child with pneumonia may
be able to explain about white cells fighting the “germs” in the lungs
but may still secretly harbor the belief that the sickness is a punishment
for disobedience.
As children are faced with more abstract concepts, academic and
classroom behavior problems emerge and come to the pediatrician’s
attention. Referrals may be made to the school for remediation or to
community resources (medical or psychologic) when appropriate.
The causes may be one or more of the following: deficits in perception (vision and hearing); specific learning disabilities (see Chapters
51 and 52); global cognitive delay (intellectual disability; Chapter
56); deficits in attention and executive function (Chapters 49 and 50);

Chapter 26 u Middle Childhood
and attention deficits secondary to family dysfunction, depression,
anxiety, or chronic illness. Children whose learning style does not fit
the classroom culture may have academic difficulties and need assessment before failure sets in. Simply having a child repeat a failed grade
rarely has any beneficial effect and often seriously undercuts the child’s
self-­esteem. In addition to finding the problem areas, identifying each
child’s strengths is important. Educational approaches that value a wide
range of talents (“multiple intelligences”) beyond the traditional reading, writing, and mathematics may allow more children to succeed.
The change in cognition allows the child to understand “if/when”
clauses. Increased responsibilities and expectations accompany
increased rights and privileges. Discipline strategies should move
toward negotiation and a clear understanding of consequences, including removal of privileges for infringements.

SOCIAL, EMOTIONAL, AND MORAL
DEVELOPMENT
Social and Emotional Development

In middle childhood, energy is directed toward creativity and productivity. Changes occur in three spheres: the home, the school, and
the neighborhood. Of these, the home and family remain the most
influential. Increasing independence is marked by the first sleepover
at a friend’s house and the first time at overnight camp. Parents should
make demands for effort in school and extracurricular activities, celebrate successes, and offer unconditional acceptance when failures
occur. Regular chores, associated with an allowance, provide an opportunity for children to contribute to family functioning and learn the
value of money. These responsibilities may be a testing ground for psychologic separation, leading to conflict. Siblings have critical roles as
competitors, loyal supporters, and role models.
The beginning of school coincides with a child’s further separation
from the family and the increasing importance of teacher and peer relationships. Social groups tend to be same-­sex, with frequent changing
of membership, contributing to a child’s growing social development
and competence. Popularity, a central ingredient of self-­esteem, may
be won through possessions (having the latest electronic gadgets or the
right clothes), as well as through personal attractiveness, accomplishments, and actual social skills. Children are aware of racial differences
and are beginning to form opinions about racial groups that impact
their relationships. Gender identification, which began in early childhood, continues to evolve and can have significant implications for
peer relationships and self-­awareness.
Some children conform readily to the peer norms and enjoy easy
social success. Those who adopt individualistic styles or have visible
differences may be teased or bullied. Children with deficits in social
skills may go to extreme lengths to win acceptance, only to meet with
repeated failure. Attributions conferred by peers, such as funny, stupid, bad, or fat, may become incorporated into a child’s self-­image and
affect the child’s personality, as well as school performance. Parents
may have their greatest effect indirectly, through actions that change
the peer group (changing the child’s school or encouraging involvement in structured after-­school activities). Children who identify with
a gender different from their sex of birth, or whose manner and dress
reflect those more typically seen as “opposite” their birth sex, may be
subject to teasing or bullying (Chapter 153). This can magnify the confusion for these children, who are formulating their own concept of
“self.”
In the neighborhood, real dangers, such as busy streets, bullies,
violence, and strangers, tax school-­age children’s common sense and
resourcefulness (see Chapter 15). Interactions with peers without close
adult supervision call on increasing conflict resolution skills. Media
exposure to adult materialism, sexuality, substance use, and violence
may be frightening, reinforcing children’s feeling of powerlessness in
the larger world. Compensatory fantasies of being powerful may fuel
the fascination with heroes and superheroes. A balance between fantasy and an appropriate ability to negotiate real-­world challenges indicates healthy emotional development.

Moral Development

Although by age 6 years most children will have a conscience (internalized rules of society), they vary greatly in their level of moral development. For younger children, many still subscribe to the notion that
rules are established and enforced by an authority figure (parent or
teacher), and decision-­making is guided by self-­interest (avoidance
of negative and receipt of positive consequences). The needs of others
are not strongly considered in decision-­making. As they grow older,
most will recognize not only their own needs and desires but also
those of others, although personal consequences are still the primary
driver of behavior. Social behaviors that are socially undesirable are
considered wrong. By age 10-­11 years, the combination of peer pressure, a desire to please authority figures, and an understanding of
reciprocity (treat others as you wish to be treated) shapes the child’s
behavior.

Implications for Parents and Pediatricians

Children need unconditional support as well as realistic demands
as they venture into a world that is often frightening. A daily query
from parents over the dinner table or at bedtime about the good and
bad things that happened during the child’s day may uncover problems early. Parents may have difficulty allowing the child independence or may exert excessive pressure on their children to achieve
academic or competitive success. Children who struggle to meet
such expectations may have behavior problems or psychosomatic
complaints.
Many children face stressors that exceed the normal challenges of
separation and success in school and the neighborhood. Approximately 50% of all marriages in the United States end in divorce.
In addition, domestic violence, parental substance abuse, and other
adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) may also impair a child’s
ability to use home as a secure base for refueling emotional energies. In many neighborhoods, random violence makes the normal
development of independence extremely dangerous. Older children
may join gangs as a means of self-­protection and a way to attain
recognition and to belong to a cohesive group. Children who bully
others and those who are victims of bullying should be evaluated,
because bullying is associated with mood disorders, family problems, and school adjustment problems. Parents should reduce exposure to hazards where possible. Because of the risk of unintentional
firearm injuries to children, parents should be encouraged to ask
parents of playmates whether a gun is kept in their home and, if so,
how it is secured.
Pediatrician visits are infrequent in this period; therefore each
visit is an opportunity to assess children’s functioning in all contexts (home, school, neighborhood). Maladaptive behaviors, both
internalizing and externalizing, occur when children do not have
safe, secure attachments to adults and stress in any of these environments overwhelms the child’s coping responses, becoming “toxic
stress.” Because of continuous exposure and the strong influence of
media (programming and advertisements) on children’s beliefs and
attitudes, parents must be alert to exposures from television and
internet. Youth 8-­12 years of age spend over 6 hr/day with a variety of media; half have a TV in their bedroom. Parents should be
advised to remove the TV from their children’s rooms, limit viewing to 2 hr/day, and monitor what programs children watch. Nearly
all children have exposure to mobile technology. Some computer
screen time may be necessary for schoolwork and virtual learning.
However, the widespread use of social media may have detrimental effects including risky health behaviors, cyberbullying, targeted
advertisements, and low self-­esteem. The Draw-­a-­Person (for ages
3-­10 years, with instructions to “draw a complete person”) and
Kinetic Family Drawing (beginning at age 5 years, with instructions to “draw a picture of everyone in your family doing something”) are useful office tools to assess a child’s functioning.

Chapter 27

Assessment of Growth
Vaneeta Bamba and Andrea Kelly
Growth can be considered a vital sign in children, and aberrant growth
may be the first sign of an underlying pathologic condition. The most
powerful tool in growth assessment is the growth chart (Figs. 24.1,
24.2, 26.1, and 27.1), used in combination with accurate measurements
of height, weight, head circumference, and calculation of the body
mass index (BMI).

TECHNIQUES TO MEASURE GROWTH

Growth assessment requires accurate and precise measurements. For
infants and toddlers age <2 years, weight, length, and head circumference are obtained. Head circumference is measured with a flexible
tape measure starting at the supraorbital ridge around to the occipital
prominence in the back of the head, locating the maximal circumference. Height and weight measures should be performed with the
infant naked, and ideally, repeated measures will be performed on the
same equipment. Recumbent length is most accurately measured by
two examiners (one to position the child). Hair ornaments and hairstyles that interfere with measurements and positioning should be
removed. The child’s head is positioned against an inflexible measuring
board in the Frankfurt plane, in which the outer canthi of the eyes
are in line with the external auditory meatus and are perpendicular
to the long axis of the trunk. Legs should be fully extended, and feet
are maintained perpendicular to the plane of the supine infant. For
older children (>2 years) who can stand unassisted, standing heights
should be obtained without shoes, using a stadiometer with the head
in the Frankfurt plane, and the back of the head, thoracic spine, buttocks, and heels approximating the vertical axis of one another and the
stadiometer.
Measurements obtained using alternative means, such as marking
examination paper at the foot and head of a supine infant or using a
tape measure or wall growth chart with a book or ruler on the head can
lead to inaccuracy and render the measurement useless.
Measurements for height and weight should be plotted on the age-­
appropriate growth curve. Comparing measurements with previous
growth trends, repeating measures that are inconsistent, and plotting
results longitudinally are essential for monitoring growth. Calculation
of interim linear height velocity, such as centimeters per year (cm/yr),
allows more precise comparison of growth rate to the norm (Table 27.1).
If a child is growing faster or more slowly than expected, measurement of body proportions, which follow a predictable sequence of
changes with development, are useful. The head and trunk are relatively
large at birth, with progressive lengthening of the limbs throughout
development, particularly during puberty. The upper-­to-­lower body
segment ratio (U/L ratio) provides an assessment of truncal growth
relative to limb growth. The lower-­body segment is defined as the
length from the top of the symphysis pubis to the floor, and the upper-­
body segment is the total height minus the lower-­body segment. The
U/L ratio equals approximately 1.7 at birth, 1.3 at 3 years, and 1.0 after
7 years. Higher U/L ratios are characteristic of short-­limb dwarfism, as
occurs with Turner syndrome or bone disorders, whereas lower ratios
suggest hypogonadism or Marfan syndrome.
Arm span also provides assessment of proportionality and is measured as the distance between the tips of the middle fingers while the
patient stands with the back against the wall with arms outstretched
horizontally at a 90-­degree angle to the trunk. This span should be
close to height, although the proportion changes with age.

GROWTH CURVES

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend use of the

2006 World Health Organization (WHO) growth curves for children
age 0-­24 months and the 2000 CDC growth curves for children age
2-­19 years (https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts). There are five standard gender-­specific charts: (1) weight for age, (2) height (length and
stature) for age, (3) head circumference for age, (4) weight for height
(length and stature) for infants, and (5) BMI for age (see Fig. 27.1;
see also Figs. 24.1, 24.2, and 26.1). Clinicians should confirm that the
correct CDC and WHO growth charts are used in electronic medical
records to ensure accurate characterization of growth.
The WHO curves describe growth differently than the CDC curves
(Fig. 27.2). The WHO curves are growth standards that describe how
children grow under optimal conditions, whereas the CDC curves are
growth references that describe how children grew in a specific time
and place. The WHO growth curves are based on longitudinal growth
studies in which cohorts of newborns were chosen from six countries
(Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman, United States) using specific
inclusion and exclusion criteria; all infants were breastfed for at least
12 months and were predominantly breastfed for the first 4 months
of life. They were measured regularly from birth to 23 months during
1997–2003. In contrast, the CDC curves are based on cross-­sectional
data from different studies during different time points. Growth curves
for children age 2-­59 months were based on the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which included a cross section of the U.S. population. These data were supplemented with additional participants in a separate nutrition surveillance study.
Several deficiencies of the older charts have been corrected, such as
the overrepresentation of bottle-­fed infants and the reliance on a local
dataset for the infant charts. The disjunction between length and height
when transitioning from the infant curves to those for older children
is improved.
Each chart is composed of percentile curves, which indicate the
percentage of children at a given age on the x axis whose measured
value falls below the corresponding value on the y axis. The 2006 WHO
growth curves include values that are 2 standard deviations (SD) above
and below median (2nd and 98th percentiles), whereas the 2000 CDC
growth curves include 3rd and 97th percentiles. On the WHO weight
chart for boys ages 0-­24 months (see Fig. 24.2A), the 9 month age line
intersects the 25th percentile curve at 8.3 kg, indicating that 25% of
9-­month-­old males in the WHO cohorts weigh less than 8.3 kg (75%
weigh more). Similarly, a 9-­month-­old male weighing more than 11 kg
is heavier than 98% of his peers. The median or 50th percentile is also
termed the standard value, in the sense that the standard length for a
7-­month-­old female is 67.3 cm (see Fig. 24.2B). The weight-­for-­length
charts (see Fig. 24.1) are constructed in an analogous fashion, with
length or stature in place of age on the x axis; the median or standard
weight for a female measuring 100 cm is 15 kg.
Extremes of height or weight can also be expressed in terms of
the age for which they would represent the standard or median. For
instance, an 18-­month-­old female who is 74.9 cm (2nd percentile) is
at the 50th percentile for a 13 month old. Thus the height age is 13
months. Weight age can similarly be expressed.
In assessing adolescents, caution must be used in applying cross-­
sectional charts. Growth during adolescence is linked temporally to the
onset of puberty, which varies widely. Normal variations in the timing of the growth spurt can lead to misdiagnosis of growth abnormalities. By using cross-­sectional data based on chronologic age, the charts
combine youth who are at different stages of maturation. Data for
12-­year-­old males include both earlier-­maturing males who are at the
peak of their growth spurts and later-­maturing ones who are still growing at their prepubertal rate. The net results are an artificially blunted
growth peak, and the appearance that adolescents grow more gradually
and for a longer duration than in actuality.
When additional insight is necessary, growth charts derived from
longitudinal data, such as the height velocity charts of Tanner and
colleagues, are recommended. The longitudinal component of these
velocity curves is based on British children from the 1950s and 1960s,
and cross-­sectional data from U.S. children were superimposed. Height
velocity curves based on longitudinal data from a multiethnic study
conducted at five U.S. sites included SD scores for height velocity for

earlier-­and later-­maturing adolescents to facilitate the identification of
poor or accelerated linear growth.
Specialized growth charts have been developed for U.S. children
with various conditions, including very low birthweight (VLBW),
small for gestational age, trisomy 21, Turner syndrome, and achondroplasia, and should be used when appropriate.
Facilitating identification of obesity, the charts include curves for
plotting BMI for ages 2-­20 years rather than weight for height (see Fig.
27.1). Methodologic steps have ensured that the increase in the prevalence of obesity has not unduly raised the upper limits of normal. BMI
can be calculated as weight in kilograms/(height in meters)2 or weight
in pounds/(height in inches)2 × 703, with fractions of pounds and
inches expressed as decimals. Because of variable weight and height
gains during childhood, BMI must be interpreted relative to age and
sex; the BMI percentile provides a more standardized comparison. For
example, a 6-­year-­old girl with a BMI of 19.7 kg/m2 (97th percentile)
is obese, whereas a 15-­year-­old female with BMI of 19.7 kg/m2 (50th
percentile) is normal weight.

Normal Growth

Height is highly correlated with genetics, specifically parental height.
Calculation of sex-­adjusted midparental height is important when
assessing growth in a child to avoid misclassification of abnormal
growth. The average difference in stature between males and females
is 5 inches (13 cm); therefore 5 inches (13 cm) is subtracted from
the father’s height before averaging with mother’s height in a female,
whereas 5 inches (13 cm) is added to the mother’s height before averaging with the father’s height in a male:
• Males: [(Maternal height + 5 inches) + Paternal height]/2
• Females: [Maternal height + (Paternal height − 5 inches)]/2

Furthermore, generally 4 inches (2 SD) is applied above and below
this value to provide a genetic target height range. For example, if the
mother is 63 inches tall and the father 70 inches tall, the daughter’s
sex-­adjusted midparental height is 64 inches ± 4 inches, for a target
height range of 60-­68 inches. The son of these same parents would
have a sex-­adjusted midparental height of 69 inches, with a range
of 65-­73 inches. Note that these general guidelines do not address
extreme differences between parental heights that may affect individual target height range.
Growth can be divided into four major phases: fetal, infantile,
childhood, and adolescence. Growth rate varies by age (see Table
27.1). Different factors are of different importance in each phase,
and the various contributors to poor growth may feature more in one
phase than another. Long-­term height may be permanently compromised if one entire phase is characterized by poor growth. Therefore
early detection and prevention are critical. Fetal growth is the fastest growth phase, with maternal, placental, fetal, and environmental
factors playing key roles. Birthweight does not necessarily correlate
with adult height, although factors that inhibit fetal growth may have
long-­lasting effects, as seen in children with intrauterine growth
retardation. Infantile growth is particularly sensitive to nutrition
as well as congenital conditions. Genetic height gradually becomes
influential; indeed, crossing of percentiles in the first 2 years of life
is common as children begin to approach their genetic potential.
Childhood growth is often the most steady and predictable. During this phase the height percentile is fairly consistent in otherwise
healthy children.
Adolescent growth is associated with a decrease in growth velocity before the onset of puberty; this deceleration tends to be more
pronounced in males. During pubertal development, sex hormones

(testosterone and estrogen) are the primary drivers of growth and
enhance growth hormone secretion, thereby facilitating pubertal
growth acceleration. Females typically experience growth acceleration
during Tanner stage 3 for breast development, whereas this acceleration occurs during Tanner stage 4 for pubic hair development in males.
Males not only achieve greater height velocities than females during
puberty, but also grow approximately 2 years longer than females, both
of which contribute to the taller average height of adult males compared with adult females.

Abnormal Growth

Growth is a dynamic process. A child measured at the 5th percentile
for stature may be growing normally, may be failing to grow, or may
be recovering from growth failure, depending on the trajectory of the
growth curve (Fig. 27.3). Growth failure must be distinguished from
short stature. Growth failure is defined as achievement of height velocity that is less than expected for a child’s age and sex (and pubertal
development if relevant) or a downward crossing of more than 2 percentile lines for height on the growth chart. Short stature is defined
as growing either below expected genetic potential or growing below
−2 SD for age and sex. For some children, however, growth parameters ≤2 SD may be normal, and differentiating appropriately small
vs. pathologically small is crucial. Midparental height, ethnicity, and
other factors that may be inherent in the child’s genetic height potential are important considerations in the assessment of growth. For
children with particularly tall or short parents, overdiagnosing and
underdiagnosing growth disorders are risks if parental heights are not
considered. In the setting of familial short stature or tall stature, more
specialized charts can help determine whether a child is even shorter
or taller than expected for parental heights, to prevent misdiagnosis of
growth disorders.
For premature infants, overdiagnosis of growth failure can be
avoided by using growth charts developed specifically for this population. A cruder method, subtracting the weeks of prematurity from
the postnatal age when plotting growth parameters, does not capture
the variability in growth velocity that VLBW infants demonstrate.
Although VLBW infants may continue to show catch-­up growth
through early school age, most achieve weight catch-­up during the

second year and height catch-­up by 3-­4 years, barring medical complications (see Chapter 119).
Abnormal growth may be caused by a variety of factors, including
congenital conditions, systemic disease, endocrine disorders, nutritional deficiency (see Chapter 62), psychosocial conditions, constitutional delay, or familial disorders (Tables 27.2 and 27.3). In congenital
pathologic short stature, an infant may or may not be born small, but
growth gradually tapers throughout infancy (see Fig. 27.3). Causes
include chromosome or genetic abnormalities (Turner syndrome,
skeletal dysplasia, trisomy 21; see Chapters 57 and 99), perinatal infection, extreme prematurity, and teratogens (phenytoin, alcohol) (see
Chapters 117.4 and 146). Linear growth deceleration with or without
changes in weight can occur at the onset or as a result of a systemic
illness or chronic inflammation. Medications such as high-­dose glucocorticoids may also impact growth. Analysis of growth patterns
requires consideration of weight status. Poor linear growth in the setting of decreasing BMI suggests a nutritional or gastrointestinal issue,
whereas poor linear growth in the context of good or robust BMI may
suggest a hormonal condition (hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, cortisol excess).
Not all decreased growth is abnormal; variations of growth include
constitutional growth (and pubertal) delay and familial short stature. In
constitutional growth delay, weight and height decrease near the end
of infancy, parallel the norm through middle childhood, and accelerate
toward the end of adolescence with achievement of normal adult height.
In familial short stature, both the infant/child and the parent(s) are
small; growth runs parallel to and just below the normal curves.
Although tall or accelerated growth may be a variation of normal,
unexpected increase in growth may also signal an underlying condition (see Table 27.3). Typically, obese individuals grow more quickly
than their peers because of peripheral aromatization of estrogen and
effects on bone maturation. Despite early taller stature, obese children
are not ultimately taller than anticipated for genetic height. Early onset
of puberty, growth hormone excess, and sex steroid exposure can also
lead to accelerated growth. Several of these conditions may ultimately
lead to short stature in adulthood. Genetic conditions associated with
tall stature and overgrowth include Sotos, Klinefelter, and Marfan syndromes (see Chapter 598 and 598.1).

Evaluation of Abnormal Growth

Evaluation of abnormal growth should include confirmation that the
data are accurate and plotted correctly. Comparisons should be made
with previous measurements. If poor or rapid growth or short or tall
stature is a concern, a radiograph of the left hand and wrist to show the
bone age can provide information about skeletal maturation. Skeletal
development represents physiologic rather than chronologic age. Reference standards for bone maturation facilitate estimation of bone age
(see Table 23.3). A delayed bone age (skeletal age younger than chronologic age) suggests catch-­up potential for linear growth. Advanced bone
age suggests a rapid maturation of the skeleton that may lead to earlier
cessation of growth. Bone age should be interpreted with the guidance
of a pediatric endocrinologist. Skeletal age correlates well with stage of
pubertal development and may be helpful in predicting adult height in

177

early-­or late-­maturing adolescents. In familial short stature the bone
age is normal (comparable to chronologic age), whereas constitutional
delay, endocrinologic short stature, and undernutrition may be associated with delay in bone age comparable to the height age.
Laboratory testing is also useful in assessment of growth and
may be tailored to suspected etiology based on the patient history
and physical examination. Initial assessment includes comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, sedimentation rate,
C-­reactive protein, thyroid-­stimulating hormone, thyroxine, celiac
panel, and insulin-­like growth factor (IGF)-­I and IGF-­BP3, which
are surrogate markers for growth hormone secretion (see Chapter
595). A karyotype to exclude Turner syndrome is an essential component of the evaluation of short stature in females and should be
performed even in the absence of characteristic physical features (see
Chapter 626.1). If there is concern for abnormal timing of puberty
contributing to growth pattern, gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone,
follicle-­stimulating hormone), and estradiol or testosterone may also
be assessed. A urinalysis can provide additional information about
renal function. Evaluation by a pediatric nutritionist for caloric needs
assessment may be useful in patients with malnutrition, underweight
status, or slow weight gain. Additional testing and referral to specialists should be performed as indicated.

OTHER GROWTH CONSIDERATIONS
Obesity

Obesity affects large numbers of children (see Chapter 65). The CDC
defines obesity as BMI ≥95th percentile for age and sex, and overweight
as BMI 85th to <95th percentile for age and sex. Although widely
accepted as the best clinical measure of underweight and overweight,
BMI may not provide an accurate index of adiposity because it does
not differentiate lean tissue and bone from fat. In otherwise healthy
individuals, lean body mass is largely represented by BMI at lower
percentiles. BMI >80–85% largely reflects increased body fat with a
nonlinear relationship between BMI and adiposity. In the setting of
chronic illness, increased body fat may be present at low BMI, whereas
in athletes, high BMI may reflect increased muscle mass. Measurement of the triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac skinfold thickness have
been used to estimate adiposity. Other methods of measuring fat, such
as hydrodensitometry, bioelectrical impedance, and total body water
measurement, are used in research, but not in clinical evaluation, but
whole body dual-­energy x-­ray absorptiometry (DXA) is beginning to
emerge as a tool for measuring body fat and lean body mass.

Dental Development

Dental development includes mineralization, eruption, and exfoliation
(Table 27.4). Initial mineralization begins as early as the second trimester (mean age for central incisors, 14 weeks) and continues through 3
years of age for the primary (deciduous) teeth and 25 years of age for
the secondary (permanent) teeth. Mineralization begins at the crown
and progresses toward the root. Eruption begins with the central incisors and progresses laterally. Exfoliation begins at about 6 years of age
and continues through 12 years. Eruption of the permanent teeth may
follow exfoliation immediately or may lag by 4-­5 months. The timing
of dental development is poorly correlated with other processes of
growth and maturation. Delayed eruption is usually considered when
no teeth have erupted by approximately 13 months of age (mean ± 3
SD). Common causes include congenital or genetic disorders, endocrine disorders (e.g., hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism), familial
conditions, and (the most common) idiopathic conditions. Individual
teeth may fail to erupt because of mechanical blockage (crowding, gum
fibrosis). Causes of early exfoliation include hypophosphatasia, histiocytosis X, cyclic neutropenia, leukemia, trauma, and idiopathic factors.
Nutritional and metabolic disturbances, prolonged illness, and certain
medications (tetracycline) frequently result in discoloration or malformations of the dental enamel. A discrete line of pitting on the enamel
suggests a time-­limited insult.

Chapter 28

Developmental and
Behavioral Surveillance
and Screening
Eliza Gordon-­Lipkin and Paul H. Lipkin
In healthy development, a child will acquire new skills beginning prenatally and extending into at least young adulthood. The roots of this
acquisition of skills lie in the development of the nervous system, with
additional influences from the health status of other organ systems
and the physical and social environment in which the development
occurs. Development and its milestones are divided into the “streams”
of gross motor, fine motor, language (expressive and receptive), social
language, and self-­help. Behavior can be categorized into observable,
spontaneous, and responsive behaviors in the settings of home, school,
and community.
Although typical development is associated with wide variability in
the age of skill acquisition in each of these streams, specific developmental and behavioral disorders are seen in approximately 1 of 6 children and may affect the health, function, and well-­being of the child
and family for a lifetime. These disorders include relatively less common conditions that often cause severe impairments, such as cerebral
palsy and autism, and relatively common conditions such as attention-­
deficit/hyperactivity disorder, speech language disorders, and behavioral and emotional disorders that affect as many as 25% of children.
The more common conditions are generally perceived as “less severe,”
but these too can have major short-­term and long-­term impact on the
child’s health and daily functioning in the home, school, and community and can affect lifelong well-­being. Because of their high prevalence
in children; their impact on health, social, and economic status; and
their effect on the child, the home, and the community, these disorders
require the attention of the pediatrician throughout childhood. In addition, both the child and the family benefit from the early identification

and treatment of many of these conditions, including the most severe. It
is therefore incumbent on the primary care clinician to conduct regular
developmental surveillance and periodic developmental screening at
health supervision visits aimed at early identification and treatment.
Among the many types of developmental or behavioral conditions,
the most common include language problems, affecting at least 10% of
children (see Chapter 53); behavior or emotional disorders, affecting up
to 25% of children, with 6% considered serious; attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder, affecting 10% of children (Chapter 50); and learning
disabilities, affecting up to 10% (Chapters 51 and 52). Less common
and more disabling are the intellectual disabilities (1–2%; Chapter
56); autism spectrum disorders (1 in 36 children; Chapter 58); cerebral palsy and related motor impairments (0.3%, or 1 in 345 children;
Chapter 638.1); hearing impairment, also referred to as deafness, hard-­
of-­hearing, or hearing loss (0.12%; Chapters 55 and 677); and nonrefractive vision impairment (0.8%; Chapter 661).

DEVELOPMENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL
SURVEILLANCE

General health surveillance is a critical responsibility of the primary
care clinician and is a key component of health supervision visits. Regular developmental and behavioral surveillance should be performed
at every health supervision visit from infancy through young adulthood. Surveillance of a child’s development and behavior includes both
obtaining historical information on the child and family and making
observations at the office visit (Tables 28.1 and 28.2).
Key historical elements include (1) eliciting and attending to the
parents’ or caregivers’ concerns around the child’s development or
behavior; (2) obtaining a history of the child’s developmental skills and
behavior at home, with peers, in school, and in the community; and (3)
identifying the risks, strengths, and protective factors for development
and behavior in the child and family, including the social determinants of health. During the office visit, the clinician should make and
document direct observations of the child’s developmental skills and
behavioral interactions. Skills in all streams of development should be
considered along with observations of related neurologic functioning
made on physical examination.
With this history and observation, the clinician should create and
maintain a longitudinal record of the child’s development and behavior
for tracking the child across visits. It is often helpful to obtain information from and share information with other professionals involved

a red flag and merits further evaluation, vigilant surveillance, or
repeat screening.

a complete picture of the child’s development and behavior and allows
collaborative tracking of the child’s progress.

The Developmental and Behavioral Histories

Developmental surveillance includes tracking a child’s achievement
of milestones, which represent key readily recognizable skills that usually occur in a predictable sequence and at predictable age ranges during childhood. The developmental skill areas can be divided into gross
motor, fine motor, speech and language (expressive and receptive),
social language, and self-­help. Tracking milestones will reveal that
most children achieve the milestones in a typical pattern and within
typical age ranges. However, the pediatrician or the parent may recognize concerning patterns of development, such as delay, dissociation,
deviation, or regression.
Developmental delay occurs when development is occurring in its
usual sequence but at a slower rate, with milestones achieved later than
the normal range (see Chapter 56). Delay can occur in a single area of
development or across several streams and can be expressed as a developmental quotient (DQ). The DQ is calculated by dividing the age at
which the child is functioning developmentally (developmental age; DA)
by chronologic age (CA) and multiplying by 100 (DQ = DA/CA × 100).

POSITIVE INDICATORS
Presence of any of the following:
Loss of developmental skills at any age
Parental or professional concerns about vision, fixing, or following an
object or a confirmed visual impairment at any age (simultaneous
referral to pediatric ophthalmology)
Hearing loss at any age (simultaneous referral for expert audiologic
or ear, nose, and throat assessment)
Persistently low muscle tone or floppiness (check creatine kinase)
No speech by 15 mo, especially if the child does not try to
communicate by other means, such as gestures (simultaneous
referral for urgent hearing test)
Asymmetry of movements or other features suggestive of cerebral
palsy, such as increased muscle tone
Persistent toe walking
Multiple organ involvement
Head circumference above the 99.6th centile or below 0.4th centile;
also, if circumference has crossed 2 centiles (up or down) on the
appropriate chart or is disproportionate to parental head
circumference
NEGATIVE INDICATORS
Activities that the child cannot do:
Sit unsupported by 12 mo
Walk by 18 mo (check creatine kinase)
Walk other than on tiptoes
Run by 24 mo
Hold object placed in hand by 4 mo (corrected for gestation)
Reach for objects by 6 mo (corrected for gestation)
Points to show you something interesting by 18 months

A DQ of 100 indicates that the child is developing at the mean or average rate, whereas a DQ below 70 is associated with delays of 2 or more
standard deviations from the mean and suggests a significant delay that
requires further evaluation.
Developmental dissociation indicates delay in a single stream with
typical development in other streams. A child with autism may have
delays in verbal or social language but normal motor skills. Deviation
or deviant development is defined by development occurring out of
sequence, as when a child stands before sitting (as in diplegic cerebral
palsy) or has better expressive vocabulary than receptive understanding of words (language and autism spectrum disorders). Regression
refers to a loss of skills. It may also be identified earlier or more subtly
by a slowing or lack of advancement in skills. Although regression is
uncommon in most developmental disabilities, regression is described
in as many as 25% of children with autism and is also seen in rarer
neurologic disorders, such as Rett syndrome and Duchenne muscular
dystrophy.
Behavioral surveillance is conducted by obtaining a history of a
child’s behavior and interactions across settings, including home, daycare, school, and community, and in situations such as eating, sleeping,
and play. In addition, interactions may differ based on who the child is
with (parent or guardian, sibling, peers, teachers, strangers). Concerns
may include limited engagement or socializing, compliance, tantrums,
aggression, destruction, impulsivity, high activity level, decreased
auditory or visual attention, and short attention span. Deviations from

usual behavior may also occur, including repetitive play, ritualistic
behaviors, perseverative thoughts or actions, and self-­injury.

Observation

Observations of the child’s developmental skills and behavioral interactions should be made in the examining room, with documentation
in the medical record, and combined with the examination of other
neurologic functioning, such as muscle tone, reflexes, and posture.
Developmental observations may include a child’s gross and fine
motor movements, both on the floor and on the examination table.
Spoken language and response to others’ communications, as well as
interactions and engagement with the parent or guardian, should be
noted. If siblings are in the room, the interaction between the child
and a sibling may also be informative. Impulsivity, attention problems, tantrums, noncompliance, oppositionality, and aggression may
be observed along with interactions with the clinician, but one should
inquire about whether these behaviors are seen in other settings, given
the possible unfamiliarity or discomfort of the child with the healthcare professional or in healthcare settings.
If inquiring about and observing the child’s development and behavior suggests normal or typical patterns of development and behavior,
discussions can be held about future milestones and usual behavior
management strategies employable at home. If problems or concerns
are identified by the parent or clinician, however, formal developmental screening, evaluation, or management should be considered, along
with early follow-­up and review.

DEVELOPMENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCREENING

Periodic episodic screening for developmental and behavioral conditions should be conducted on every child, as done for other health
conditions such as anemia, lead poisoning, hearing, and congenital
metabolic disorders. Developmental and behavioral screenings are
centered on administration of low-­cost, brief, and standardized tests
in the primary care setting. These tests can be implemented by health
assistants at age-­determined visits, with interpretation of the results
and referral or treatment initiation by the primary care clinician as
indicated.
The American Academy of Pediatrics provides recommendations and guidelines on age-­specific developmental screening for
implementation in the primary care medical home. Developmental
screening using a formal, validated, and standardized test is recommended during health supervision visits at 9, 18, and 30 months.
Tests recommended at these ages screen development across all the

streams. In addition, an autism screening test is recommended at
the 18 and 24 month visits. Tables 28.3 and 28.4 provide recommended screening tests for general development and for autism. It
is also recommended that a child have a screening test administered
any time that a parent, guardian, or child health or early childhood
professional has concerns identified during developmental surveillance, or through screening performed at early childhood programs. Although routine formal screening before the child’s entry
into elementary school is not included in current guidelines, the
primary care clinician should be vigilant about surveillance regarding development at the 4 or 5 year old visit and perform formal
screening if concerns are identified, because of the potential impact
on learning and school services.
Each of the screening visits offers special opportunities to identify
specific developmental conditions. At the 9 month screening, critical
areas of development are vision, hearing, gross motor, fine motor, and
receptive language. It is at this age that disabilities may be identified in
vision or hearing, as well as cerebral palsy and other neuromotor disorders. At 18 months, expressive language and social language development are particularly important areas. Conditions identified at this age
may include those considered at 9 months, although in milder forms,
as well as autism spectrum, language, and intellectual disorders. By the
30 month visit, the child’s behavioral interactions become an additional
area of focus, with problems emerging tied to attention and disruptive
behavior disorders. Although universal screening is not recommended
at later ages, developmental surveillance may identify children in need
of screening or evaluation for problems in learning, attention, and
behavior.
Additional screening for behavioral conditions should be considered,
although there is currently no recommended consensus on the ages
at which behavioral screening should occur. One possibility would be
to provide behavioral screening at the 30 month, 4 or 5 year, and 8
year visits to identify problems emerging in the toddler, preschool, and
early elementary years. For older children, visits during preadolescent
or adolescent ages also offer an opportunity for surveillance and possible screening for behavioral and emotional problems meriting professional assistance or intervention. Table 28.5 provides recommended
behavior screening tools.

the pediatric clinician can enter the room with results in hand for

on child development and behavior, any areas of concern, referrals needed, and information to share with the child’s daycare, preschool, or other community providers, when applicable.

an individual child’s performance on the test with that of the large sample of typically developing children. In addition, the tests demonstrate
accepted standards of reliability, or the ability to produce consistent
results; predictive validity, or the ability to predict later test performance or development; sensitivity, or accuracy in the identification of
delayed development or disability; and specificity, or accuracy in the
identification of children who are not delayed. Some of the screening
tests are general, evaluating multiple areas of development or behavior
(sometimes referred to as “broad band”). Others are domain specific,

ensure that the child receives an appropriate diagnostic evaluation,
related medical testing, and indicated developmental interventions and medical treatment. When a concern is identified, a full
diagnostic evaluation should be performed by a professional with
appropriate training and experience. In the case of developmental
concerns, this may be a pediatric specialist, such as a neurodevelopmental pediatrician/neurologist or a developmental-­behavioral
pediatrician, or a related developmental professional, depending on
resources in the local community. Related professionals may include
early childhood educators, psychologists, speech/language pathologists, audiologists, physical therapists, and occupational therapists,
many of whom are available through the local early intervention
system. Such an evaluation would typically include more detailed
standardized developmental testing. The primary care physician
should ensure that hearing and vision assessments are completed.
For the child with motor concerns, the physician should pay particular attention to the motor and neurologic evaluation. Children
with language delays should have hearing, speech, language, and
learning skills (e.g., reading, phonics) evaluated.
The primary care clinician should also perform a comprehensive
medical evaluation of the child to identify any related health conditions. Physical examination including head circumference should
be reviewed to identify growth abnormalities and dysmorphic
features. For the child with motor delay and decreased or normal
muscle tone, serum creatine kinase and thyroid function testing
are recommended to rule out muscular dystrophy and thyroid disease, respectively. When there is increased tone, MRI or referral to
a neurologist should be considered. For the child with suspected
autism or intellectual disability (or global developmental delay),
chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing are recommended
(see Chapter 56).

Referral and Intervention

Children with significant developmental delays or an identified
developmental disability are entitled to and usually benefit from early
intervention with therapy services directed at delayed or atypical
development. The U.S. Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
(IDEA) entitles any child with a disability or developmental delay
to receive local education and related services, including therapy,
from as early as birth, for known or high-­risk conditions that lead
to such delay or disability, through age 21 years. These interventions
enhance the child’s development through early intervention and family support as well as individualized public education with the goal
of improving long-­term functional outcomes and reducing public
costs. The pediatric provider should therefore refer every child with
developmental concerns to the local early intervention program or
agency (ages 0-­3 years), public school program (≥ 3 years), and/or
local therapy providers. Typical service needs include special education for the child with intellectual or learning concerns, physical or
occupational therapy for children with motor delays, speech language
therapy for the child with language or social communication difficulties, and behavioral therapy services for the child with social engagement or other behavior problems.
Likewise, the child with specific behavior concerns should be
referred to an appropriate pediatric or behavioral health professional
who can perform a thorough evaluation and assist the family to alleviate the problems or concerns. Such professionals may include those
trained in developmental-­
behavioral pediatrics, neurodevelopmental disabilities, adolescent medicine, child and adolescent psychiatry,
pediatric psychology, psychiatric advanced practice nursing, and social
work. Such an evaluation is similar to developmental evaluation in
its aim of determining a diagnosis, as well as developing a treatment
program that may include psychotherapeutic and medication management. Associated medical or developmental disorders should be considered and further evaluated as needed.

Ongoing Management

Children with developmental or behavioral disorders should be identified as children with special healthcare needs in the medical home,
with a program of chronic condition management initiated by the
clinical program staff, including its medical and nonmedical staff. In
doing so, the clinician and family should work together to outline
the child’s short-­and long-­term goals and management plan. This
includes a program of regular monitoring and follow-­up of the child’s
development and behavior, referrals, treatment, and surveillance for
identification and treatment of related medical, developmental, or
behavioral comorbidities that may arise. Some children and families
may warrant assignment of a case manager or care navigator either
within the medical home or in a related local agency. The pediatric clinician or other medical home staff should participate in care
coordination activities as needed and assist the family and other professionals in decision-­making on medical care, therapies, and educational services.
The family can be further assisted during the screening and referral phases or later with ongoing care by referral to support service
programs, such as respite care, parent-­to-­parent programs, and
advocacy organizations. Some children may qualify for additional
state or federal benefit programs, including insurance, supplemental security income, and state programs for children with special
healthcare needs. Families often seek out information, support, or
connection to other families with similarly affected children and
find benefit in local or national networks (e.g., Family Voices, Family to Family Health Information centers) and condition-­specific
associations.

Implementation

The principles and professional guidelines for developmental-­
behavioral surveillance and screening have been solidified to identify children with developmental disabilities, including the specific
conditions of intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder,
motor disorders, and behavioral-­emotional problems. Specific algorithms are included in these guidelines to assist the clinician with
implementation. However, primary care clinicians have reported
difficulties in putting these into practice, with obstacles and barriers identified and policy changes made to ensure that screening and
referral can be implemented. (See Bibliography online for specific
guidelines.)
Implementation projects have identified key factors for successful incorporation of developmental surveillance and screening
into practice. Successful office-­based screening requires development of a comprehensive office-­based system that extends from
the child’s home to the front office and into the clinic visit, rather
than solely centered on the time in the clinic room. This requires
utilizing office and medical support staff for scheduling, advance
test distribution, and initiation of the surveillance and screening
procedures before the health supervision visit. The practice must
choose screening tests that are not only valid for screening of the
specific condition at the recommended ages, but also appropriate to
the population being served (including reading level and language).
The tests chosen should be able to be completed by the caregiver in
a short time and at low cost. Staff training on billing and coding for
these procedures ensures appropriate payment.
Practice systems should also be developed for referral and tracking of children who have problems identified through screening. This
should include systems for referral to early intervention, community
therapy, developmental professionals, and medical consultants. Office
representatives or the clinician should establish working relationships
with local community programs and resources to assist the child and
family.

Chapter 29 u Child Care

Chapter 29

Child Care
Laura Stout Sosinsky and Walter S. Gilliam
Child care impacts the health and development of children and the
economic stability of families. For too many young children and their
families, affordable high-­quality child care is not accessible. Pediatricians have a role in helping children receive safe, enriching care in
high-­quality early childhood education (ECE) settings that allows parents to be able to work.
As an environment in which children learn, grow, and play, child
care is a component of the social determinants of health. The majority of young children regularly spend time in at least one nonparental
child care arrangement. Routine exposure to high-­quality child care
provides an opportunity for early education in language, early literacy, math, and social skills, as well as for teaching children health-­
promoting behaviors and for identifying early signs of delays or special
needs. Inadequate child care supply and poor availability block these
opportunities for many children, disproportionately those from low-­
resourced families. Instead, many young children are exposed to a
patchwork of child care arrangements that are unstable, unaffordable,
and often poorly resourced, adding stress that harms child and family
well-­being.
Child care provision is affected by many factors, derived from family demand, child care supply, and child/family policy. With increasing
movement of mothers into the workplace across the globe, the prime
reason most families use child care is to support employment of both
parents. After childbirth, unpaid maternity leave is the typical situation among U.S. mothers. The U.S. federal leave program allows for 12
weeks of unpaid job-­protected leave during pregnancy or after childbirth, but only covers approximately 50% of the workforce because
companies with <50 employees, with part-­time employees, and those
working in informal labor markets are exempt. Several states and cities
have passed paid family leave laws.
In part because of the financial burden of an unpaid maternity leave,
many mothers return to work, and their children may begin child care
in the first few weeks after birth. In a 2000 Family and Medical Leave
Act survey, only 10% of respondents reported taking more than 60 days
for maternity leave. Approximately 44% of mothers in 2005–2007 were
working by the time their first child was 3-­4 months of age, and approximately 63% of mothers were working by the time their first child was
12 months. Some mothers face work requirements if they are receiving
public benefits because of the reforms to welfare passed by the U.S.
Congress in 1996. Many mothers feel strong financial motivation or
even pressure to work, especially in single-­parent households, or have
strong incentive to work for short-­and long-­term financial security.
Employment is not the only factor driving child care use; young children of unemployed mothers spend on average 21 hours per week in
child care. Many parents want their children to have child care experiences for the potential benefits that early learning environments can
give to their children. Given these realities, child care quality is of great
concern, yet the quality of child care and early education environments varies widely, and the supply of high-­quality child care is largely
deemed inadequate.
The COVID-­19 pandemic revealed the fragility of America’s child
care system. Relative to adults, young children have been far less likely
to suffer severe medical complications from coronavirus infection,
and rates of transmission in child care facilities that followed mitigation protocols have been low. However, the downstream effects of the
pandemic on young children have been acute. Burdensome child care
cost and access barriers became exaggerated. Parents of young children report significant concerns about their children’s safety and education during the pandemic and describe significant disruptions and
impacts on families’ well-­being. Estimates indicate that 1 in every 500

183

U.S. children have experienced COVID-­19 orphanhood or the loss of a
caregiving grandparent, further highlighting a crisis in early childhood
caregiving.

QUALITY, PROVISION, REGULATION, AND ACCESS
Child Care Quality

High-­quality child care is characterized by warm, responsive, and
stimulating interactions between children and child care providers.
These caregivers express positive feelings toward the children; are emotionally involved, engaged, and aware of the child’s needs and sensitive
and responsive to their initiations; speak directly with children in a
manner that is elaborative and stimulating while being age-­appropriate;
and ask questions and encourage children’s ideas and verbalizations.
Structural quality features of the setting, including ratio of children to
adults, group size, and caregiver education and training, act indirectly
on child outcomes by facilitating high-­quality interactions. It would
be highly unlikely, if not impossible, for even the most sensitive and
stimulating provider to engage in high-­quality interactions with each
child, if, for example, the provider was the sole caregiver of 10 toddlers.
Poor-­quality child care settings and unsafe environments that do
not meet children’s basic physical and emotional needs can result in
developmental delays tied to lack of healthy relationships with adults or
developmentally inappropriate activities, toxic stress, neglect, or injury
or death from fire, building hazards, disease, and inadequate staff oversight. State regulations put a “floor” on structural quality and basic staff
indicators to mitigate risks and safeguard health and safety. Although
structural indicators are more easily monitored in licensing, some but
not all research suggests only modest relationships of structural indicators with child outcomes. When it comes to process quality, a body
of studies demonstrates small-­to-­modest associations with short-­term
child development and some evidence of long-­term impacts.
The early childhood field is focusing increasingly on effective practices, evidence-­based curricula, and programs that are reported to have
moderate-­to-­large effects on child outcomes. Some specific teacher
practices are related to gains in academic and social-­emotional skills
among preschool students. Evidence-­informed and evaluated ECE
curricula with aligned professional development can have substantial
impacts on child outcomes across several developmental domains.
Primary caregiving, the practice in infant and toddler classrooms
of assigning one teacher the primary responsibility for the care of a
small group of children and developing relationships with their families, is consistent with research showing that infants who experience
stable, consistent, sensitive and responsive care develop more secure
attachment relationships and more positive developmental outcomes.
Family engagement, in which early educators partner with families to
share their unique knowledge of each child to build positive and goal-­
oriented relationships, relates to gains in preschool children’s social and
early academic skills and reduced problem behaviors.

Integration of Health and Safety Within Quality
Practices

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Public Health
Association, and the National Resource Center for Health and Safety in
Child Care and Early Education provide health and safety guidelines in
Caring for Our Children (CFOC): National Health and Safety Performance
Standards; Guidelines for Early Care and Education Programs, 4th ed.
(https://nrckids.org/CFOC; 2019). These national standards represent
the best evidence on quality practices and address health and safety as an
integrated component of early care and education. The intent is for the
guidelines to serve as a resource for states and other entities to improve
health and safety standards in licensing and quality rating improvement
systems. An additional objective is for the various monitoring agencies
and mechanisms to work together to collaboratively safeguard children
and minimize or eliminate the duplication and burden of complicated
and sometimes conflicting procedures and requirements.
The current guidelines include sections in 10 areas (Table 29.1).
The National Resource Center also provides updated online resources:

child care health consultants and providers learn how the CFOC standards address provision of safe and healthy early care and education
environments during the COVID-­19 pandemic.

Child Care Settings and Use

Public early education programs (such as Head Start and targeted state-­
funded prekindergarten programs) have historically been designed as
policy mechanisms to close the school readiness gap among children with
fewer resources, whereas child care has been seen as necessary when parents (usually mothers) work while their children are young. Despite these
historical “silos,” all early care and education settings serve both purposes:
they are early learning environments for children and necessary supports
for working parents.
Quality of care matters for all child care settings, but there are key
differences in the structure and provision of care that influence organizational and business operations, regulatory mandates, and accessibility and affordability for families.
Child care settings vary widely and fall into four broad categories
from the least to the most formal:
1.	Relative or friend cares for a child in the relative’s or friend’s home or
in the child’s home

2.	Nonrelative care who comes to the child’s home, such as nannies,
babysitters, or au pairs
3.	Home-­based child care in which an individual runs a child care business
in their own home and cares for a few or several children, often including children of mixed ages, siblings, or the provider’s own children
4.	Center-­based care, provided in nonresidential facilities for children
grouped by age, including preschools, prekindergarten programs,
Head Start centers, and child care centers.
Child care centers and early education programs are administered by a
wide array of businesses and organizations, including for-­profit providers
or companies, religious organizations, public and private schools including early childhood special education programs, nonprofits and other
community organizations, cooperatives, employer-­based child care, and
public agencies. Increasingly, publicly funded prekindergarten programs
contract with existing community-­based centers and home-­based providers for program delivery. With a few exceptions (such as faith-­affiliated
child care), center-­based child care programs must satisfy state licensing
laws for safety practices. For other child care options, governmental oversight for health and safety is rarer; many home-­based child care programs
are licensed, whereas many others are unknown to regulatory agencies,
and family, friend, and nanny care are almost never regulated. Child care
licensing and regulation is described in the next section.
Approximately 59% of children 5 years and younger and not
yet in kindergarten were in at least 1 weekly nonparental child
care arrangement, as reported by their parents in the U.S. Census
Bureau’s 2019 National Household Education Surveys Program.
Forty-­two percent of children less than 1 year of age, 55% of 1-­2
year olds, and 74% of 3-­5 year olds were in nonparental care. Nearly
60% of those in at least one child care arrangement were in a center-­
based arrangement, 38% were in relative care, and 20% were in nonrelative care in a private home; children may have been in more
than one type of arrangement. Center-­based arrangements were
most common among preschoolers, whereas relative care arrangements were most common among infants.

Child Care Closures

The COVID-­19 pandemic accelerated a worsening trend of child care
closures. In 2012, there were approximately 129,000 center-­based programs serving 6.98 million children from birth through age 5. Between
2014 and 2017, the number of licensed child care programs of all types
in the United States decreased to approximately 109,000 centers. The
number of listed home-­based providers (which includes licensed or
otherwise regulated providers) decreased by about 25% between 2012
and 2019.
In response to COVID-­19, by April 2020 new state public health
requirements resulted in closing 70% of U.S. child care centers; more
than 35% of child care workers became unemployed. Reasons for this
include COVID-­19 outbreaks and preventative health protocols such
as social distancing with limits in group sizes and child:staff ratios. As
the pandemic continued, reasons for new or even permanent closures
included staffing shortages as well as business models that cannot support a program’s financial survival at low enrollment rates. However,
child masking within the first year of the pandemic was associated with
a 13-14% reduction in child care closure rates.

Licensing, Regulation, Monitoring, and Accreditation

State and territory licensing agencies enumerate which providers are
subject to licensing to legally operate and monitor those providers’
compliance with foundational, mandated regulations to protect children’s safety, health, and well-­being. Many states and territories also
offer systems of child care monitoring that are usually voluntary in
nature, such as quality rating and improvement systems (QRIS), and
various professional organizations offer voluntary accreditation systems to assess whether providers meet higher-­quality standards, often
(but not always) requiring licensure as a prerequisite to participation.

Licensing

Licensing and regulatory requirements establish the minimum
requirements necessary to protect the health and safety of children in

Chapter 29 u Child Care
child care. Typically, these include basic health and safety standards
such as sanitary practices, child and provider vaccinations, access to
a healthcare professional, and facilities and equipment hazards and
safety, as well as basic structural and caregiver characteristics such
as background checks, the ratio of children to staff, group sizes, and
minimum caregiver education and training requirements. Most child
care centers and preschools and many family child care providers are
subject to state licensing and regulation. All states regulate child care
centers, as does the District of Columbia, and most states regulate family child care providers.
Pediatricians are encouraged to learn about their own state’s child
care licensing rules. Large differences between states mean large differences in allowable levels of quality. The most common child:staff ratios
are 4:1 for infants, 6:1 for toddlers, and 10:1 for preschoolers. However,
some states permit ratios that are 5:1 or 6:1 for infants 9 months of age
or younger.
State and territory child care licensing regulations are maintained
in a searchable National Database of Child Care Licensing Regulations
(https://childcareta.acf.hhs.gov/licensing) by the National Center on
Early Childhood Quality Assurance (NCECQA). The site provides a
tool for searching state and territory licensing regulations and agency
contact information. Licensing requirements are frequently updated.
Unlicensed settings and even licensed providers in states with low
licensing and regulatory standards may be providing care at quality levels below professional recommendations. Moreover, various types of
programs may be exempt from licensure, such as faith-­affiliated child
care programs, and exemptions are specific to each state; as many as
one third of child care centers are legally exempt in some states. Centers are often exempted if care is offered by other organizations such
as school districts that provide external oversight. The smallest homes
(three or four children in care) are often license-­exempt, encompassing
relative, friend, and neighbor caregivers as well as babysitters, nannies,
and au pairs. Some of these providers and the families who use them
may not even think of themselves as providing “child care.” The Child
Care Development Block Grant (CCDBG) reauthorization in 2014
required states and territories to expand their monitoring of legally
exempt providers to protect the health and safety of children receiving
subsidized child care. Most states require exempt centers and family
child care homes to meet some licensure requirements such as background checks and to receive an annual inspection to receive child care
subsidy payments.

Other Quality Monitoring Systems

Several voluntary public and private initiatives require that child care
settings meet their own sets of guidelines and regulations in areas
considered critical to effective practice and child outcomes to receive
either state or federal funding. These diverse initiatives include those
that focus on nutrition (the Child and Adult Care Food Program
[CACFP]), inclusion (the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
[IDEA]), and financial assistance to low-­
income working parents
(child care subsidies through the CCDBG). Most states have quality
initiatives called QRIS. Publicly funded early education programs,
including the federal Head Start and Early Head Start program as well
as state and local public prekindergarten have their own program performance standards.
Participating providers benefit in ways that may include technical
assistance supports, professional development, and additional funding
often tied to the numbers of children served under the program. About
75% of early care and education centers report receiving funds from
multiple sources. Providers may also value earning a public-­facing “seal
of approval” to help families learn about higher-­quality programs.
These programs all monitor eligibility and compliance with program
standards. For example, Head Start and most of the state prekindergarten programs that restrict enrollment to low-­income families require
verification of family eligibility (although some states’ and cities’ prekindergarten programs are universally available to all preschool-­age
children regardless of family income). Other eligibility standards
include verification of parental employment for child care subsidies or
verification of nutritious food for low-­income families for receipt of

185

CACFP funds. Other monitoring may cover staffing, meals and snacks,
curricula and teaching, and other areas of service delivery. QRIS systems work within the infrastructure of the early care and education
system to assess, incentivize, and support higher levels of quality.
Examples of incentives and supports include tiered subsidy reimbursement systems in which participating providers who achieve levels of
quality beyond basic licensing requirements are entitled to higher subsidy payments, public funding to facilitate accreditation, professional
development systems and coaching, and program assessments and
technical assistance.

Accreditation

A smaller portion of providers become accredited by National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), National
Association for Family Child Care (NAFCC), or other organizations
by voluntarily meeting high-­
quality, developmentally appropriate,
professionally recommended standards. The accreditation process
goes beyond health and safety practices and structural and caregiver
characteristics to examine the quality of child–caregiver interactions.
Evidence indicates that child care programs that complete voluntary
accreditation through NAEYC provide an environment that better
facilitates children’s overall development, but few providers are accredited. This is partly the result of a lack of knowledge, resources, and
incentives for providers to improve quality, but it may also be partly
because of expenses providers incur in becoming accredited.

Child Care Access

As one social determinant of health, access to affordable high-­quality
child care that supports child development and meets family needs
is critical.
Access to child care goes beyond simple “supply” (numbers of available slots) and “demand” (numbers of young children needing extra-­
familial care). Barriers to access include aspects of affordability, hours
of operation, location, transportation, and culturally or linguistically
appropriate care. Barriers to access to high-­quality child care are pervasive among families in which caregivers work irregular, fluctuating,
or nontraditional work schedules, families with infants and toddlers,
families for whom English is not the primary language spoken at home,
and families with children with disabilities or special needs.
Two thirds of children 5 years of age and younger have both parents
in the workforce or in school or training programs. Nearly 30% of low-­
income mothers of children under 6 years of age work nonstandard
hours, but child care supply during nonstandard or irregular hours is
extremely limited. Over 30% of parents with children in weekly care
report that the arrangement does not cover the hours needed for work
very well. Many more report that they are not in the workforce or
school, or not working the hours or shifts that they need or want, due
to lack of affordable accessible child care.

SCREENING AND SUPPORT FOR CHILD
­DEVELOPMENT AND HEALTH
Child Care and Child Behavior

Before the COVID-­19 pandemic, about 192,000 U.S. young children
were being expelled or suspended from child care programs annually
for concerns rising from developmentally typical crying and temper
tantrums to physical aggression to violations of various “zero tolerance policies,” such as bringing a water gun to child care. In fact, young
children are expelled from child care and preschool programs at a rate
more than 3 times that for kindergarten through 12th graders. Young
children experiencing any number of adverse childhood events are at
significantly increased odds of preschool expulsion, such as exposure to
domestic or community violence, family mental illness and substance
abuse, poverty, parental divorce, and parental incarceration. These
disciplinary exclusions are disproportionately applied to young males
and to children of color; implicit biases account for at least some of
these disproportionalities. These early disciplinary exclusions predict
later negative school attitudes, academic failure and grade retention,
and later expulsions and suspensions, as well as a 10-­fold increase in
high-­school dropout rates and an 8-fold increase in later incarceration.

186 Part II u Growth, Development, and Behavior
State efforts to reduce early childhood exclusionary discipline
include early childhood mental health consultation (ECMHC) models
to support child care providers, who are often not well trained in managing child behavior, as well as build capacity to raise child care quality
for all children. ECMHC links a mental health professional with an
early education and care provider in an ongoing problem-­solving and
capacity-­building relationship. ECMHC has been shown to be effective in statewide randomized controlled trials, and now exist in several states and cities. Because this is a rapidly evolving area of support,
clinicians wishing to provide guidance to parents of young children
at risk of early disciplinary exclusion should consider inquiring about
the existence of an ECMHC system within their state or locality by
contacting their state early childhood department and/or state/local
child care resource and referral agency. Local regulations may limit or
prohibit the exclusion of children in response to behaviors that may be
a symptomatic expression of a diagnosed disability or special education
need, providing a potential method for safeguarding a child’s ability to
receive early care and education, as described in the next section.

Children with Special Needs

Children with cognitive, physical, or emotional disabilities who require
special care and instruction often require particular attention when it
comes to their participation in most child care settings. Guiding principles of services for children with disabilities advocate supporting children in natural environments, including child care. Furthermore, the
Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973 prohibit discrimination against children and adults with
disabilities by requiring equal access to offered programs and services.
Child care can be, and often is, utilized for delivery of support services to children with special needs and/or for linking families to services such as early intervention. Furthermore, clinicians can draw on
child care providers for important evaluative data regarding a child’s
well-­being, as these providers have extensive daily contact with the
child and may have broad, professional understanding of normative
child development. Child care providers often conduct screenings for
developmental milestones and delays using standardized instruments.
A child care provider may be the first to identify a child’s potential
language delay. Child care providers are also necessary and valuable
partners in the development and administration of early intervention
service plans. However, many child care providers and settings are
unprepared to identify or administer services for children with special
needs.
Children with special needs may be eligible for special educational
services under IDEA. The purpose of this law is to provide “free appropriate public education,” regardless of disability or chronic illness, to
all eligible children, birth to 21 years of age, in a natural and/or least-­
restrictive environment. Eligible children include those with mental,
physical, or emotional disabilities who, because of their disability or
chronic illness, require special instruction to learn. As a part of these
services, a formal plan of intervention is to be developed by the service providers, families, and the children’s healthcare providers. Federal funds are available to implement a collaborative early intervention
system of services for eligible infants and toddlers between the ages
of birth and 3 years and their families. These services include screening, assessment, service coordination, and collaborative development
of an individualized family service plan (IFSP). The IFSP describes
early intervention services for the child’s health, therapeutic, and educational needs and supports needed by the family. An understanding
of the child’s routines and real-­life opportunities and activities, such as
eating, playing, interacting with others, and working on developmental
skills, is crucial to enhancing a child’s ability to achieve the functional
goals of the IFSP. Therefore it is critical that child care providers be
involved in IFSP development or revision, with parental consent. Child
care providers should also become familiar with the child’s IFSP and
understand the providers’ role and the resources available to support
the family and child care provider. Additionally, IDEA provides support for eligible children 3 years of age and older to receive services
through the local school district. This includes development of a written individualized education program (IEP), with implementation

being the responsibility of the local education agency in either a public
or private preschool setting. As with IFSPs, child care providers should
become familiar with the preschooler’s special needs as identified in
the IEP and may become involved, with parental consent, in IEP development and review meetings. In cases where children may have or be
at risk of developmental delays, a diagnosis is important for obtaining
and coordinating services and further evaluation. To this end, clinicians can partner with child care providers to screen and monitor children’s behavior and development. Even if a young child is not being
provided special educational services, special accommodations may be
requested for any child whose access to child care is being adversely
impacted by a diagnosable developmental or behavioral disability
through Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

Sick Children and Control of Infectious Disease

When children are ill, they may be excluded from out-­of-­home child
care and under state licensure child care programs are required to
exclude children with certain conditions. Children in child care are
of an age that places them at increased risk for acquiring infectious
diseases. Participation in group settings elevates exposure, leading to
increased infections, especially during the first year of child care exposure and especially with infants. Children enrolled in such settings have
a higher incidence of illness (upper respiratory tract infections, otitis
media, diarrhea, hepatitis A infections, skin conditions, and asthma)
than those cared for at home, especially in the preschool years; these illnesses have no long-­term adverse consequences. Child care providers
that follow child care licensure guidelines for handwashing, diapering,
and food handling, and manage child illness appropriately, can reduce
communicable illnesses.
CFOC (2019) and its up-­to-­date online supplement and the AAP
(Table 29.2) offer guidelines and recommendations regarding the conditions under which sick children should and should not be excluded
from group programs. State laws typically mirror these guidelines but
may be stricter in some states. Although exclusion from child care due
to mild illness is often unnecessary, their summary of guidelines states
that a child should be excluded temporarily from care if the signs or
symptoms of the illness does any of the following:
u Prevents the child from participating in daycare activities
u Results in a level of care that is greater than the staff can provide
u Poses a contagion risk of serious diseases to other children and staff
For COVID-­
19 exposure or symptoms or recovery go to
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-­nCoV/index.html
Health checks should be performed on each child every day. If symptoms develop during child care but do not require exclusion, written
or verbal communication after the daycare is appropriate. Emergencies must be addressed with 911 calls and immediate notification of
the family. If nonemergent but requiring exclusion, the parents should
be notified to take the child home. Parents should have a backup plan
when exclusions occur. Return to child care is usually permissible without a primary healthcare visit.
CFOC also provides guidelines for control of infectious disease outbreaks and for exclusion of any child or staff member who is suspected
of contributing to transmission of the illness, who is not adequately
immunized when there is an outbreak of a vaccine-­preventable disease, or when the circulating pathogen poses an increased risk to the
individual.
During the first 3 months of the COVID-­19 pandemic in the United
States, exposure to child care was not associated with an elevated risk of
COVID-­19 transmission to adult child care providers within the context of the considerable efforts that were employed to reduce transmission. Although enhanced hand hygiene and surface disinfecting were
the most common transmission mitigation methods, many child care
programs also engaged in daily symptom screening and temperature
checks, social distancing efforts, and cohorting (i.e., keeping groups of
children separate to help control the speed of transmission). Despite
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance, masking of adults and children were rarely employed; federal guidance and
requirements in several states, child care provider COVID-­19 vaccination rates in June 2021 were only 78.2%. COVID-­19 modifications and

Yes

For bacterial conjunctivitis
No. Exclusion is no longer required
for this condition. Healthcare
providers may vary on whether to
treat this condition with antibiotic
medication. The role of antibiotics
in treatment and preventing spread
is unclear. Most children with
pinkeye get better after 5 or 6 days
without antibiotics.
For other eye problems
No, unless child meets other
exclusion criteria.
Note: One type of viral conjunctivitis
spreads rapidly and requires
exclusion. If two or more children
in the group have watery red
eyes without any known chemical
irritant exposure, exclusion
may be required and health
authorities should be notified to
determine whether the situation
involves the uncommon epidemic
conjunctivitis caused by a specific
type of adenovirus. Herpes
simplex conjunctivitis (red eyes
with blistering/vesicles on eyelid)
occurs rarely and would also require
exclusion if there is eye watering.

Fever

⦁	Any viral, bacterial, or
parasitic infection
⦁	Vigorous exercise
⦁	Reaction to
medication or vaccine
⦁	Other noninfectious
illnesses (e.g.,
rheumatoid arthritis,
malignancy)

Not necessary

Yes

No, unless
Exclusion criteria are resolved.
⦁	Behavior change or other signs of
illness in addition to fever or child
meets other routine exclusion
criteria.
⦁	Unable to participate.
⦁	Care would compromise staff’s
ability to care for other children.
Note: A temperature considered
meaningfully elevated above normal,
although not necessarily an indication
of a significant health problem, for
infants and children older than 2 mo
is above 101°F (38.3°C) from any site
(axillary, oral, or rectal).
Get medical attention when infants
younger than 4 mo have unexplained
fever. In any infant younger than 2
mo, a temperature above 100.4°F
(38.0°C) is considered meaningfully
elevated and requires that the child
get medical attention immediately,
within an hour if possible. The fever
is not harmful; however, the illness
causing it may be serious in this age
group.

Flushing, tired, irritable, decreased
activity
Notes:
⦁	Fever alone is not harmful. When
a child has an infection, raising
the body temperature is part
of the body’s normal defense
against germs.
⦁	Rapid elevation of body
temperature sometimes triggers
a febrile seizure in young children;
this usually is outgrown by age 6
yr. The first time a febrile seizure
happens, the child requires medical
evaluation. These seizures are
frightening but are usually brief
(less than 15 minutes) and do not
cause the child any long-­term
harm. Parents should inform their
child’s healthcare provider every
time the child has a seizure, even
if the child is known to have febrile
seizures.
Warning: Do not give aspirin. It has
been linked to an increased risk of
Reye syndrome (a rare and serious
disease affecting the brain and liver).

⦁ For bacterial conjunctivitis,
once parent has discussed
with healthcare provider.
Antibiotics may or may not be
prescribed.

case of sudden, severe headache
with vomiting or stiff neck that
might signal meningitis. It would be
concerning if the back of the neck
is painful or the child cannot look at

⦁	Head lice
⦁	Scabies
⦁	Allergic or irritant
reaction (e.g., poison
ivy)
⦁	Dry skin or eczema
⦁	Impetigo

⦁	Ringworm: itchy ring-­shaped
patches on skin or bald patches
on scalp.
⦁	Chickenpox: blister-­like spots
surrounded by red halos on scalp,
face, and body; fever; irritable.
⦁	Pinworm: anal itching.
⦁	Head lice: small insects or white
egg sheaths that look like grains
of sand (nits) in hair.
⦁	Scabies: severely itchy red bumps
on warm areas of body, especially
between fingers or toes.
⦁	Allergic or irritant reaction:
raised, circular, mobile rash;
reddening of the skin; blisters
occur with local reactions
(poison ivy, contact reaction).
⦁	Dry skin or eczema: dry areas
on body. More often worse on
cheeks, in front of elbows, and
behind knees. In infants, may be
dry areas on face and anywhere
on body but not usually in the
diaper area. If swollen, red, or
oozing, think about infection.
⦁	Impetigo: areas of crusted
yellow, oozing sores. Often
around mouth or nasal openings
or areas of broken skin (insect
bites, scrapes).

Yes, for
infestations
such as lice
and scabies; if
more than one

has impetigo or
ringworm; for
chickenpox

Yes

For chickenpox:
Yes, until lesions are fully crusted
For ringworm, impetigo, scabies, and
head lice:
Yes, at the end of the day
Children should be referred to a
healthcare provider at the end of
the day for treatment.
For pinworm, allergic or irritant
reactions like hives, and eczema:
No, unless appears infected as a
weeping or crusty sore
Note: Although exclusion for these
conditions is not necessary, families
should seek advice from the child’s
health professional for how to care
for these health problems.
For any other itching:
No, unless the child meets routine
exclusion criteria.

⦁ Exclusion criteria are resolved.
⦁ On medication or treated as
recommended by a
healthcare provider if
treatment is indicated for
the condition. For conditions
that require application of
antibiotics to lesions or taking
antibiotics by mouth, the period
of treatment to reduce risk of
spread to others is usually 24
hours. For most children with
insect infestations or parasites,
readmission as soon as the
treatment has been given is
acceptable.

Mouth sores

⦁	Oral thrush (yeast
infection)
⦁	Herpes or coxsackie­
virus infection
⦁	Canker sores

⦁	Oral thrush: white patches on
tongue, gums, and along inner
cheeks
⦁	Herpes or coxsackievirus
infection: pain on swallowing;
fever; painful, white/red spots in
mouth; swollen neck glands;
fever blister, cold sore;
reddened, swollen, painful lips
⦁	Canker sores: painful ulcers
inside cheeks or on gums

Not necessary

Yes

No, unless
⦁	Drooling steadily related to mouth
sores.
⦁	Fever with behavior change.
⦁	Child meets routine exclusion
criteria.

Many causes
⦁	Viral: roseola infantum,
fifth disease, chickenpox,
herpesvirus,
molluscum contagiosum,
warts, cold sores,
shingles (herpes zoster),
and others
⦁	Skin infections and
infestations: ringworm
(fungus), scabies
(parasite), impetigo,
abscesses, and
cellulitis (bacteria)
⦁	Scarlet fever (strep
infection)
⦁	Severe bacterial
infections:
meningococcus,
pneumococcus,
Staphylococcus
(methicillin-­susceptible
S. aureus;
methicillin-­resistant

⦁	Noninfectious causes:
allergy (hives), eczema,
contact (irritant)
dermatitis, medication
related, poison ivy

⦁	Skin may show similar findings
with many different causes.
Determining cause of rash
requires a competent
healthcare provider evaluation
that takes into account
information other than just how
rash looks. However, if the child
appears well other than the rash,
a healthcare provider visit is not
necessary.
⦁	Viral: usually signs of general
illness such as runny nose, cough,
and fever (except not for warts
or molluscum). Some viral rashes
have a distinctive appearance.
⦁	Minor skin infections and
infestations: see Itching.
⦁	More serious skin infections:
redness, pain, fever, pus.
⦁	Severe bacterial infections: rare.
These children usually have fever
with a rapidly spreading
blood-­red rash and may be very
ill.
⦁	Allergy may be associated with
a raised, itchy, pink rash with
bumps that can be as small as
a pinpoint or large welts known
as hives. See also Itching for
what might be seen for allergy
or contact (irritant) dermatitis or
eczema.

For outbreaks,
such as multiple
children with
impetigo within

Yes

No, unless
⦁	Rash with behavior change or
fever.
⦁	Has oozing/open wound.
⦁	Has bruising not associated with
injury.
⦁	Has joint pain and rash.
⦁	Rapidly spreading blood-­red rash.
⦁	Tender, red area of skin, especially
if it is increasing in size or
tenderness.
⦁	Child meets routine exclusion
criteria.
⦁	Diagnosed with a vaccine-­
preventable condition, such as
chickenpox.

⦁	On antibiotic medication for
required period (if indicated).
⦁	Infestations (lice and scabies)
and ringworm can be treated
at the end of the day with
immediate return the following
day.
⦁	Exclusion criteria are resolved.

Sore throat
(pharyngitis)

⦁	Viral: common cold
viruses that cause
upper respiratory
infections
⦁	Strep throat

⦁	Viral: verbal children will
complain of sore throat;
younger children may be
irritable with decreased
appetite and increased drooling
(refusal to swallow). Often see
symptoms associated with upper
respiratory illness, such as runny
nose, cough, and congestion.
⦁	Strep throat: signs of the body’s
fight against infection include red
tissue with white patches on sides
of throat, at back of tongue (tonsil
area), and at back wall of throat.
Unlike viral pharyngitis, strep
throat infections are not
accompanied with cough or runny
nose in children older than 3 yr.
⦁	Tonsils may be large, even
touching each other. Swollen
lymph nodes (sometimes called
“swollen glands”) occur as body
fights off the infection.

Not necessary

Yes

No, unless
⦁	Inability to swallow.
⦁	Excessive drooling with breathing
difficulty.
⦁	Fever with behavior change.
⦁	Child meets routine exclusion
criteria.
Note: Most children with red back
of throat or tonsils, pus on tonsils,
or swollen lymph nodes have viral
infections. If strep is present, 12 hours
of antibiotics is required before return
to care. However, tests for strep
infection are not often necessary for
children younger than 3 yr because
these children do not develop
rheumatic heart disease, which is the
primary reason for treatment of strep
throat.

⦁	Able to swallow.
⦁	On medication at least 12
hours (if strep).
⦁	Exclusion criteria are resolved.

Stomachache

⦁	Viral gastroenteritis or
strep throat
⦁	Problems with internal
organs of the abdomen
such as intestine,
colon, liver, bladder

⦁	Viral gastroenteritis or strep
throat: Vomiting and diarrhea
or cramping are signs of a
viral infection of the stomach
or intestine. Strep throat may
cause stomachache with sore
throat, headache, and possible
fever. In children older than
3 yr, if cough or runny nose is
present, strep is very unlikely.

considerations are itemized in the Crosswalk (https://nrckids.org/files
/CFOC.Crosswalk.pdf) and include, for example, discussion of daily
symptom checks for children as well as daily screening procedures and
exclusion criteria for staff.
Most families need to arrange to keep sick children at home necessitating staying home from work or having backup plans with an alternative caregiver. Alternative care arrangements outside the home for
sick children are relatively rare but may include either (1) care in the
child’s own center, if it offers special provisions designed for the care of
ill children (sometimes called the infirmary model or sick daycare), or
(2) care in a center that serves only children with illness or temporary
conditions. Although it is important that such arrangements emphasize preventing further spread of disease, one study found no occurrence of additional transmission of communicable disease in children
attending a sick center.

Protection and Promotion of Child Health

Child care has a role in protecting and promoting child health and
well-­being. Child care providers are often the first to notice signs of
child abuse and neglect and are a major source of child welfare referrals. Findings of increased health-­related issues in the first year of child
care are likely a testament to early detection benefits provided by child
care providers.

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome

A disproportionate number of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
deaths occur in child care centers or family-­based child care homes.
Infants who are back-­sleepers at home but are put to sleep on their
front in child care settings have a higher risk of SIDS. Providers and
parents should be made aware of the importance of placing infants on
their backs to sleep.

Asthma and Respiratory Illness

Children enrolled in prekindergarten may have a greater risk of asthma
diagnosis during prekindergarten but a lower risk in the years following
prekindergarten, when compared with children who were not exposed
to prekindergarten. Enrollment in prekindergarten may increase the
early detection of asthma symptoms.
A 10-­year follow-­up of a birth cohort has found no association
between child care attendance and respiratory infections, asthma,
allergic rhinitis, or skin-­prick test reactivity. Another study found
that in the first year of elementary school, children who had attended
child care had fewer absences from school, half as many episodes of
asthma, and less acute respiratory illness than their peers who had
never attended child care. These results are perhaps related to protection against respiratory illness through early exposure or a shift in the
age-­related peak of illness, although selection of illness-­prone children into homecare may play a role. Other factors include children
in child care potentially being less exposed to passive smoking than
children at home.

Vision and Hearing Problems

Children enrolled in a citywide universal prekindergarten program
had higher probability of diagnosis of vision problems, receipt of treatment for hearing or vision problems, and receiving an immunization.
These effects were not offset by lower rates in the kindergarten year,
suggesting that identification and treatment of these conditions was
accelerated by enrollment in universal prekindergarten. As hearing
and vision problems could potentially delay learning and cause behavioral problems, early detection and treatment is beneficial for future
health and school readiness.

Obesity and Promotion of Healthy Behaviors

There is insufficient research on longitudinal associations between child
care, diet, and physical activity behaviors. Some limited research suggests a negative or mixed association between child care exposure and
healthy behaviors, but the strength of these associations, and whether
any causal implications exist, are difficult to tease apart. Other research
suggests that child care center-­based interventions are generally found

193

to be effective in improving physical activity and may be effective at
improving dietary behaviors.
The CDC identifies child care settings as one of the best places to
reach young children with obesity prevention efforts. Through their
Spectrum of Opportunities framework (https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/
strategies/childcareece.html), they outline how a state’s early care and
education system can embed recommended standards and support for
obesity prevention, including nutrition, infant feeding, physical activity, and screen time.

ROLE OF PEDIATRIC PROVIDERS
Consultation, Referrals, and Screening to Improve
Access

Many parents are first-­time purchasers of child care with little experience and very immediate needs; they may select care in a market that
does little to provide them with useful information about child care
arrangements. To inform their child care decisions, parents may turn
to their child’s healthcare provider as the only professional with expertise in child development with whom they have regular and convenient
contact. Primary care clinicians should screen for child care just as
they do for other social determinants of health, asking about child care
arrangements and offering information about resources to help find
and pay for child care to reinforce the importance of child care and
increase the chances that children are enrolled in high-­quality settings.
It is difficult for many parents to find high-­quality child care that
they can accept and afford. Many parents also worry how their child
will fare in child care (e.g., they may worry that their child will feel distressed by the group settings, suffer from separation from the parents,
or even be subjected to neglect or abuse). Practical concerns of transportation, scheduling to cover their work or school hours, and reliability are also common. The reliability of the arrangement is often rated
as a “very important” selection factor by a higher proportion of parents
than any other factor, followed by availability and staff qualifications.
Among those who reported difficulty finding child care, cost was most
often the primary reason, followed by lack of open slots, quality, then
location or other reasons. Worries about finding quality child care are
especially likely among parents with greater barriers to child care access
and fewer personally accessible family and community resources. With
the coronavirus pandemic, parents may be worried about the transmission of COVID-­19 and about sporadic disruptions in service caused
by quarantines or temporary closures, and unfounded fears about the
safety of vaccines or facial masks.
Primary care practices can share information with parents about
publicly available sources of information to help them find or pay for
child care (Table 29.3). For example, they can
u Refer low-­income parents to Head Start, which serves 3-­4 year old
children, or Early Head Start programs, which serves low-­income
expecting families and their children until their child’s third birthday
u Refer low-­income working parents to apply for child care subsidies
and financial assistance in their state or county
u Refer parents to their local child care resource and referral agency
for help finding and selecting child care; these can be located via the
national association, Child Care Aware of America (www.childcarea
ware.org/families)
Some parents may think of child care only as babysitting focusing
mainly on whether the child is safe and warm and may not fully appreciate the potential consequences of unenriched care for their child’s cognitive, linguistic, and social development. These parents may be less likely
to select a high-­quality child care arrangement. Healthcare providers can
help parents understand the importance for their child’s development
of selecting high-­quality care by describing how it looks and providing
referrals and tips on how to find and select high-­quality child care. Families facing socioeconomic challenges accessing high-quality care should
be referred to available resources listed previously and in Table 29.3.
When a healthcare provider talks with a parent about a child care
arrangement, it also is important to consider the individual child’s
health concerns, dispositions, and physiologic responses to the environment. Like all environments, child care is experienced differently

by different children. When an environment lacks adequate support
for a child’s unique needs, healthy development can be compromised.
Some children may be more vulnerable to low-­quality child care (or
particularly responsive to high-­quality child care), such as children
with difficult or fearful temperaments, especially if their home environments are characterized by more risk factors, such as poverty or high
conflict with a parent. Clinicians can help parents determine how to
adjust child care arrangements to best meet their child’s specific needs
(e.g., allergies, eating and sleeping habits, temperament, and stress-­
regulation capacities).

Children Who Are Expelled from Child Care

A provider may tell a parent that they will not continue to serve a
child because of the child’s behaviors. Such expulsions are prohibited
in some regulated child care settings, such as Head Start and many
state-­funded prekindergarten programs. In addition to complete termination of a child’s child care arrangement (expulsion), children are
sometimes told that they cannot attend for a certain number of days
(suspension) or have their hours of care reduced, sent home from care
early, or excluded in other ways. Regardless of the form of the exclusion
or its stated reason, the result is often extremely stressful for the child
and family, and often the child care provider too. Indeed, parents may
lose their jobs due to the resulting lack of reliable child care or resort
to dangerous alternatives, such as leaving the child unattended or in
an unsafe arrangement. Healthcare providers should play an important role during child care expulsions by supporting families’ efforts to
find alternative care, perhaps through a referral to their local child care
resource and referral agency, assessing for any potentially contributory
underlying developmental or behavioral concerns, and asking parents
about the safety of any alternative care arrangements. (See Standard
2.2.0.8 [Preventing Expulsions, Suspensions, and Other Limitations in
Services] of Caring for Our Children, as well as the most recent policy
statement on this issue by the AAP.)

Supporting Parents Regarding Children’s Health

Parents frequently may ask primary care clinicians about sick children,
exposure to and prevention of risks in child care, and support for children with special needs in child care. When children are ill, parents
should be advised to follow guidelines for inclusion and temporary
exclusion (see CFOF, CDC, and state guidelines) (see Table 29.2). Parents may disagree with child care staff about whether a child meets or
does not meet the exclusion criteria, as a substantial amount of work
absenteeism is due to a child illness, showing the impact of lost child
care on parental employment. However, professional guidelines in
CFOC state that if the reason for exclusion relates to the child’s ability to participate or the caregiver’s ability to provide care for the other
children, the caregiver should not be required to accept responsibility
for the care of the child.
Primary care clinicians should emphasize that parents of infants
ensure that child care providers put infants on their backs to sleep to
prevent SIDS and follow vaccination schedules, including COVID-­19
vaccination as it is available to children of younger ages. Most states
require compliance with scheduled vaccinations for children to participate in licensed group child care settings. As of October 2021, only
three states (Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey, and Washington) plus
the District of Columbia required child care providers to be vaccinated
against COVID-­19 and/or participate in regular testing.

Helping Families of Children with Special Needs

Healthcare providers should work with parents and communicate with
other service providers and early intervention staff to identify problems, remove access barriers, and coordinate service delivery for children with special needs. They should also encourage involvement of
parents and child care providers in developing special education plans
such as IEPs and IFSPs. Federal law emphasizes the central role of the
family in the development of these plans, and the team writing this plan
must consist of the parent or legal guardian and other professionals

that may be involved in the provision of these services, including child
care providers. Healthcare providers have an important role to play on
these IFSP teams and may attend meetings at the request of the family.
Many children with developmental or other special needs that would
qualify them for early childhood special education services will present
with health concerns, making the healthcare professionals an essential part of adequate early education planning. Additionally, healthcare
professionals may support a child’s civil rights to access public services
such as preschool when their access or ability to participate fully in the
program are at risk of limitation due to a diagnosable disability, health,
or mental health condition. Often this may require writing a letter stating the nature of the medical condition and the types of accommodations that may improve the child’s ability to participate more fully in
the range of activities offered by the program. By supporting a child’s
civil rights under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, clinicians can and should play
an integral role for safeguarding the rights of their patients.

Consulting and Partnering with Child Care Providers

Most state regulations mandate that licensed programs have a formal
relationship with a healthcare provider. They can provide consultation
to child care providers about measures to protect and maintain the
health and safety of children and staff. This may include consultation
regarding promoting practices to prevent SIDS; preventing and reducing the spread of communicable disease; reducing allergen, toxin, and
parasite exposure; ensuring vaccinations for children and staff; removing environmental hazards; and preventing injuries. In some cases
pediatricians have provided ongoing health and mental health consultation to child care programs, such through highly successful programs
like HealthySteps (https://www.healthysteps.org/) and “Docs for Tots”
(https://docsfortots.org/).

include poor appetite, behavior issues such as acting against caregiver
requests, reluctance to go to bed, sleep problems, or regressive behavior, such as requesting a bottle or bed-­wetting. School-­age children
may experience impaired cognitive functioning and poor performance
in school. Some children may repeatedly ask for the absent parent and
question when the absent parent will return. The child may go to the
window or door or out into the neighborhood to look for the absent
parent; a few may even leave home or their place of temporary placement to search for their parents. Other children may not refer to the
parental absence at all.
A child’s response to reunion may surprise or alarm an unprepared
parent. A parent who joyfully returns to the family may be met by wary
or cautious children. After a brief interchange of affection, children
may seem indifferent to the parent’s return. This response may indicate
anger at being left or wariness that the event will happen again, or the
young child may feel, as a result of magical thinking (see Chapter 25),
as if the child caused the parent’s departure. For example, if the parent
who frequently says “Stop it, or you’ll give me a headache” is hospitalized, the child may feel at fault and guilty. Because of these feelings,
children may seem more closely attached to the present parent than
to the absent one, or even to the grandparent or babysitter who cared
for them during their parent’s absence. Some children, particularly
younger ones, may become more clinging and dependent than they
were before the separation, while continuing any regressive behavior
that occurred during the separation. Such behavior may engage the
returned parent more closely and help to reestablish the bond that the
child felt was broken. Such reactions are usually transient, and within
1-­2 weeks, children will have recovered their usual behavior and equilibrium. Recurrent separations may tend to make children wary and
guarded about reestablishing the relationship with the repeatedly
absent parent, and these traits may affect other personal relationships.
Parents should be advised not to try to modify a child’s behavior by
threatening to leave.

DIVORCE

Chapter 30

Loss, Separation, and
Bereavement
Megan E. McCabe and Janet R. Serwint
All children will experience involuntary separations, whether from
illness, death, or other causes, from loved ones at some time in their
lives. Relatively brief separations of children from their parents usually
produce minor transient effects, but more enduring and frequent separation may cause sequelae. The potential impact of each event must be
considered in light of the age, stage of development, and experiences
of the child; the particular relationship with the absent person; and the
nature of the situation.

SEPARATION AND LOSS

Separations may be from temporary causes, such as vacations, parental
job requirements, natural disasters or civil unrest, or parental or sibling
illness requiring hospitalization. More long-­term separations occur as
a result of divorce, placement in foster care, or immigration, whereas
permanent separation may occur because of death. The initial reaction of young children to separation of any duration may involve crying, such as a tantrum type, protesting type, and a quieter, sadder type.
Children’s behavior may appear subdued, withdrawn, fussy, or moody,
or they may demonstrate resistance to authority. Specific problems may

195

More sustained experiences of loss, such as divorce or placement in
foster care, can give rise to the same kinds of reactions noted earlier,
but they are more intense and possibly more lasting. Currently in the
United States, approximately 40% of first marriages end in divorce.
Divorce has been found to be associated with negative parent functioning, such as parental depression and feelings of incompetence; negative child behavior, such as noncompliance and whining; and negative
parent–child interaction, such as inconsistent discipline, decreased
communication, and decreased affection. Greater childhood distress is
associated with greater parental distress. Continued parental conflict
and loss of contact with the noncustodial parent is common.
Two of the most important factors that contribute to morbidity of the
children in a divorce include parental psychopathology and disrupted
parenting before the separation. The year after the divorce is the period
when problems are most apparent; these problems tend to dissipate
over the next 2 years. Depression may be present up to 5 years later,
and educational or occupational decline may occur even 10 years later.
It is difficult to sort out all confounding factors. Children may suffer
when exposed to parental conflict that continues after divorce and that
in some cases may escalate. The degree of interparental conflict may be
the most important factor associated with child morbidity. A continued relationship with the noncustodial parent when there is minimal
interparental conflict is associated with more positive outcomes.
School-­age children may become depressed, may seem indifferent,
or may be extremely angry. Other children appear to deny or avoid
the issue, behaviorally or verbally. Most children cling to the hope that
the actual placement or separation is not real and only temporary. The
child may experience guilt by feeling that the loss, separation, or placement represents rejection and perhaps punishment for misbehavior.
Children may protect a parent and assume guilt, believing that their
own “badness” caused the parent to depart. Children who feel that their
misbehavior caused their parents to separate may have the fantasy that
their own trivial or recurrent behavioral patterns caused their parents
to become angry at each other. A child might perceive that outwardly

196 Part II u Growth, Development, and Behavior
blaming parents is emotionally risky; parents who discover that a child
harbors resentment might punish the child further for these thoughts
or feelings. Some children have behavioral or psychosomatic symptoms and unwittingly adopt a “sick” role as a strategy they hope will
reunite their parents.
In response to divorce of parents and the subsequent separation and
loss, older children and adolescents usually show intense anger. Five
years after the breakup, approximately 30% of children report intense
unhappiness and dissatisfaction with their life and their reconfigured
family; another 30% show clear evidence of a satisfactory adjustment;
and the remaining children demonstrate a mixed picture, with good
achievement in some areas and faltering achievement in others. After
10 years, approximately 45% do well, but 40% may have academic,
social, or emotional problems. As adults, some are reluctant to form
intimate relationships, fearful of repeating their parents’ experience.
Parental divorce has a moderate long-­term negative impact on the
adult mental health status of children, even after controlling for changes
in economic status and problems before divorce. Good adjustment of
children after a divorce is related to ongoing involvement with two psychologically healthy parents who minimize conflict and to the siblings
and other relatives who provide a positive support system. Divorcing
parents should be encouraged to avoid adversarial processes and to use
a trained mediator to resolve disputes if needed. Joint-­custody arrangements may reduce ongoing parental conflict, but children in joint custody may feel overburdened by the demands of maintaining a strong
presence in two homes.
When the primary care provider is asked about the effects of divorce,
parents should be informed that different children may have different
reactions, but that the parents’ behavior and the way they interact will
have a major and long-­term effect on the child’s adjustment. The continued presence of both parents in the child’s life, with minimal interparental conflict, is most beneficial to the child.

MOVE/FAMILY RELOCATION

A significant proportion of the U.S. population changes residence
each year. The effects of this movement on children and families are
frequently overlooked. For children, the move is essentially involuntary and out of their control. When changes in family structure such
as divorce or death precipitate moves, children face the stresses created by both the precipitating events and the move itself. Parental sadness surrounding the move may transmit unhappiness to the children.
Children who move lose their old friends, the comfort of a familiar
bedroom and house, and their ties to school and community. They
not only must sever old relationships but also are faced with developing new ones in new neighborhoods and new schools. Children may
enter neighborhoods with different customs and values, and because
academic standards and curricula vary among communities, children
who have performed well in one school may find themselves struggling
in a new one. Frequent moves during the school years are likely to have
adverse consequences on social and academic performance.
Migrant children and children who emigrate from other countries
present with special circumstances. These children not only need to
adjust to a new house, school, and community, but also need to adjust
to a new culture and in many cases a new language. Because children have faster language acquisition than adults, they may function
as translators for the adults in their families. This powerful position
may lead to role reversal and potential conflict within the family. In the
evaluation of migrant children and families, it is important to ask about
the circumstances of the migration, including legal status, violence or
threat of violence, conflict of loyalties, and moral, ethical, and religious
differences.
Parents should prepare children well in advance of any move and
allow them to express any unhappy feelings or misgivings. Parents
should acknowledge their own mixed feelings and agree that they
will miss their old home while looking forward to a new one. Visits
to the new home in advance are often useful preludes to the actual
move. Transient periods of regressive behavior may be noted in preschool children after moving, and these should be understood and
accepted. Parents should assist the entry of their children into the new

community, and whenever possible, exchanges of letters and visits with
old friends should be encouraged.

SEPARATION BECAUSE OF HOSPITALIZATION

Potential challenges for hospitalized children include coping with separation; adapting to the new hospital environment; adjusting to multiple
caregivers; seeing very sick children; and sometimes experiencing the
disorientation of intensive care, anesthesia, and surgery. To help mitigate potential problems, a preadmission visit to the hospital can help
by allowing the child to meet the people who will be offering care and
ask questions about what will happen. Parents of children <5-­6 years
old should room with the child if feasible. Older children may also benefit from parents or other family members staying with them while in
the hospital, depending on the severity of their illness. Creative and
active recreational or socialization programs with child life specialists,
chances to act out feared procedures in play with dolls or mannequins,
and liberal visiting hours, including visits from siblings, are all helpful. Sensitive, sympathetic, and accepting attitudes toward children and
parents by the hospital staff are very important. Healthcare providers
need to remember that parents have the best interest of their children
at heart and know their children the best. Whenever possible, school
assignments and tutoring for hospitalized children should be available
to engage them intellectually and prevent them from falling behind in
their scholastic achievements.
The psychologic aspects of illness should be evaluated from the outset, and physicians should act as a model for parents and children by
showing interest in a child’s feelings, allowing them a venue for expression, and demonstrating that it is possible and appropriate to communicate about discomfort. Continuity of medical personnel may be
reassuring to the child and family.

MILITARY FAMILIES

More than 2 million children live in military families in the United
States, and approximately 50% of them obtain medical care in the community rather than at a military medical facility. Children whose parents are serving in the military may experience loss and separation in
multiple ways. These include frequent relocations, relocation to foreign
countries, and duty-­related separation from parents. The most impactful experiences have been repeated wartime deployments of parents
and the death of parents during military service. All branches of the
military have increased their focus on preparing and supporting military families for a service member’s deployment to improve family coping. Military families composed of young parents and young children
are at risk for child maltreatment in the context of repeated or prolonged deployments.

PARENTAL/SIBLING DEATH

Approximately 5–8% of U.S. children will experience parental death;
rates are much higher in parts of the world more directly affected by
war, AIDS, and natural disasters. Anticipated deaths from chronic illness may place a significant strain on a family, with frequent bouts of
illness, hospitalization, disruption of normal home life, absence of the
ill parent, and perhaps more responsibilities placed on the child. Additional strains include changes in daily routines, financial pressures, and
the need to cope with aggressive treatment options.
Children can and should continue to be involved with the sick parent or sibling, but they need to be prepared for what they will see in the
home or hospital setting. The stresses that a child will face include visualizing the physical deterioration of the family member, helplessness,
and emotional lability. Forewarning the child that the family member
may demonstrate physical changes, such as appearing thinner or losing hair, will help the child to adjust. These warnings combined with
simple yet specific explanations of the need for equipment, such as a
nasogastric tube for nutrition, an oxygen mask, or a ventilator, will help
lessen the child’s fear. Children should be honestly informed of what is
happening, in language they can understand, allowing them choices,
but with parental involvement in decision-­making. They should be
encouraged, but not forced, to see their ill family member. Parents who
are caring for a dying spouse or child may be too emotionally depleted

to be able to tend to their healthy child’s needs or to continue regular
routines. Children of a dying parent may suffer the loss of security and
belief in the world as a safe place, and the surviving parent may be
inclined to impose his or her own need for support and comfort onto
the child. However, the well parent and caring relatives must keep in
mind that children need to be allowed to remain children, with appropriate support and attention. Sudden, unexpected deaths lead to more
anxiety and fear because there is no time for preparation, and explanations for the death can cause uncertainty. Examples of this may be
death of a parent due to a motor vehicle crash, homicide or suicide,
sudden health-­related issue such as a myocardial infarction or stroke,
or from infection such as the recent COVID pandemic. Providing support to the child is paramount to allow him or her to express sorrow
and grief and to have stability in the child’s remaining relationships.

GRIEF AND BEREAVEMENT

Grief is a personal, emotional state of bereavement or an anticipated
response to loss, such as a death. Common reactions include sadness,
anger, guilt, fear, and at times, relief. The normality of these reactions
needs to be emphasized. Most bereaved families remain socially connected and expect that life will return to some new, albeit different,
sense of normalcy. The pain and suffering imposed by grief should
never be automatically deemed “normal” and thus neglected or
ignored. In uncomplicated grief reactions, the steadfast concern of
the pediatrician can help promote the family’s sense of well-­being. In
more distressing reactions, as seen in traumatic grief of sudden death,
the pediatrician may be a major, first-­line force in helping children and
families address their loss.
Participation in the care of a child with a life-­threatening or terminal
illness is a profound experience. Parents experience much anxiety and
worry during the final stages of their child’s life. In one study, 45% of
children dying from cancer died in the pediatric intensive care unit,
and parents report that 89% of their children suffered “a lot” or “a great
deal” during the last month of life. Physicians consistently underreport
children’s symptoms compared with parents’ reports. Better ways are
needed to provide care for dying children. Providers need to maintain
honest and open communication, provide appropriate pain management, and meet the families’ wishes as to the preferred location of the
child’s death, in some cases in their own home. Inclusion of multiple
disciplines, such as hospice, clergy, nursing, pain service, child life specialists, social work, and pet therapy, often helps to support patients
and families fully during this difficult experience.
The practice of withholding information from children and parents
regarding a child’s diagnosis and prognosis has generally been abandoned, because physicians have learned that protecting parents and
patients from the seriousness of their child’s condition does not alleviate concerns and anxieties. Even very young children may have a real
understanding of their illness. Children who have serious diseases and
are undergoing aggressive treatment and medication regimens, but
who are told by their parents that they are okay, are not reassured. These
children understand that something serious is happening to them, and
they are often forced to suffer in silence and isolation because the message they have been given by their parents is to not discuss it and to
maintain a cheerful demeanor. Children have the right to know their
diagnosis and should be informed early in their treatment. The content
and depth of the discussion needs to be tailored to the child’s personality and developmental level of understanding. Parents have choices as
to how to orchestrate the disclosure. Parents may want to be the ones
to inform the child themselves, may choose for the pediatric healthcare
provider to do so, or may do it in partnership with the pediatrician.
A death, especially the death of a family member, is the most difficult loss for a child. Many changes in normal patterns of functioning
may occur, including loss of love and support from the deceased family
member, a change in income, the possible need to relocate, less emotional support from surviving family members, altering of routines,
and a possible change in status from sibling to only child. Relationships
between family members may become strained, and children may
blame themselves or other family members for the death of a parent or
sibling. Bereaved children may exhibit many of the emotions discussed

earlier as a result of the loss, in addition to behaviors of withdrawal into
their own world, sleep disturbances, nightmares, and symptoms such
as headache, abdominal pains, or possibly symptoms similar to those
of the family member who has died. Children 3-­5 years of age who have
experienced a family bereavement may show regressive behaviors such
as bed-­wetting and thumb sucking. School-­age children may exhibit
nonspecific symptoms, such as headache, abdominal pain, chest pain,
fatigue, and lack of energy. Children and adolescents may also demonstrate enhanced anxiety if these symptoms resemble those of the
family member who died. Bereavement may be measured by various
published scales (Table 30.1). Behavioral patterns of persistent complex
bereavement disorder are noted in Table 30.2.
The presence of secure and stable adults who can meet the child’s
needs and who permit discussion about the loss is most important
in helping a child to grieve. The pediatrician should help the family understand this necessary presence and encourage the protective
functioning of the family unit (Table 30.3). More frequent visits to the
healthcare professional may be necessary to address these symptoms
and provide reassurance when appropriate. Suggested availability of
clergy or mental health providers can provide additional support and
strategies to facilitate the transitions after the death.
Death, separation, and loss as a result of natural catastrophes and
human-­made disasters have become increasingly common events in children’s lives. Exposure to such disasters occurs either directly or indirectly,
where the event is experienced through the media. Examples of indirect
exposure include scenes of earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, tornadoes,
and terrorist attacks. Children who experience personal loss in disasters
tend to watch more media coverage than children who do not. Children
without a personal loss watch as a way of participating in the event and
may thus experience repetitive exposure to traumatic scenes and stories.
The loss and devastation for a child who personally lives through a disaster are significant; the effect of the simultaneous occurrence of disaster

198 Part II u Growth, Development, and Behavior
Table 30.2  Developmental Manifestations of Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder in Children and Adolescents:
Developmental Considerations and Symptom Manifestation in Youth
CHILD HAS EXPERIENCED THE DEATH OF A LOVED ONE

CRITERION A
CRITERION B
B1: Expression of persistent yearning or
longing for the deceased

Children have an evolving understanding of the permanence of death, particularly among young
children; behavioral expressions of separation distress from surviving caregivers are common, as are
reunification fantasies (i.e., wanting to die to be reunited with the parent in the afterlife)

B2: Intense sorrow or emotional pain

Children focus on the more salient immediate physical environment rather than their own internal
state; young children often have difficulties expressing inner mood; overt expressions of emotional
pain might be interspersed within seemingly normal mood, which can lead to others incorrectly
assuming they are not grieving

B3: Preoccupation with the person who
died

Children might become distressed when separated from the deceased parent’s belongings; it is
common for youth to seek out physical connections to their parent, including sleeping in the parent’s
bed, or wearing their clothing or jewelry

B4: Preoccupation with the
circumstances of the death

Young children might reenact the death through play, sometimes with alternate (i.e., counterfactual)
actions that depict what children feel they or others could have done to prevent the death;
reenacting might also take the form of drawing disturbing scenes or aspects of the death

CRITERION C
C3: Difficulties related to positive
reminiscing about the deceased

Children’s ability to reminisce matures with development and is often facilitated by surviving caregivers

C4: Bitterness or anger related to the
loss

Youth might show overall irritability, oppositional behavior, and problem behavior in the context of
bereavement; externalizing behaviors are often precipitated by changes to the youth’s daily routine
that are a result of the parent’s absence (including others assuming the deceased parent’s roles)

C5: Maladaptive self-­appraisals in
relation to the deceased or the death

Youth, particularly adolescents, might become preoccupied by a perceived accountability (e.g.,
blaming others or oneself for their parent’s death); in young children, this might manifest as magical
thinking that their own thoughts or actions caused their parents to die

C6: Excessive avoidance of reminders
of the loss

Avoidance might not always be under a child’s control (e.g., a parent might choose not to bring the
child to the gravesite, which prevents the child from confronting that reminder)

C7: Desire not to live so that they can
be with the deceased

Children and adolescents often experience suicidal ideation as a means of reunification fantasies, and
their reduced understanding of the complexities of death might exacerbate this mindset among
young children; suicidal ideation associated with reunification fantasies might not be accompanied
by intent or planning; adolescents might engage in risk-­taking behaviors (e.g., substance use,
reckless driving)

C8: Difficulty trusting other people
since the death

Children might have difficulty establishing relationships with new caregivers, which is often reflective of
difficulty with new life circumstances, rather than lack of trust; youth might also display overt anger or
oppositional and defiant behaviors toward the surviving or new caregiver

C9: Feeling alone or detached from
others since the death

Youth often report feelings of alienation from other peers who have not experienced a similar loss,
particularly when reminders of this difference are salient (e.g., seeing other classmates’ parents
coming to a school event); children and adolescents might conceal their own grief reactions to
protect their caregivers from additional distress

C10: Feeling that life is meaningless
or empty without the deceased or
the belief that they cannot function
without the deceased

Developmental regressions (e.g., regression in toileting or language among young children; loss
of study skills or emotion regulation in adolescents) are common, as are disruptions to sleep and
appetite patterns; adolescents can show a lack of engagement in preparations for adulthood (e.g.,
applying to jobs)

C11: Confusion about their role in life
or a diminished sense of their identity

Youth can express sadness over lost opportunities they were planning to experience with their
deceased caregiver (e.g., riding a bicycle, walking down the aisle at their wedding); adolescents
might show disorganization, lack of direction, or both

and personal loss complicates the bereavement process as grief reactions
become interwoven with posttraumatic stress symptoms (see Chapter 38).
After a death resulting from aggressive or traumatic circumstances, access
to expert help may be required. Under conditions of threat and fear, children seek proximity to safe, stable, protective figures.
It is important for parents to grieve with their children. Some parents want to protect their children from their grief, so they put on an
outwardly brave front or do not talk about the deceased family member
or traumatic event. Instead of the desired protective effect, the child
receives the message that demonstrating grief or talking about death
is wrong, leading the child to feel isolated, grieve privately, or delay
grieving. The child may also conclude that the parents did not really

care about the deceased because they seem to have forgotten the person
so easily or demonstrate no emotion. The parents’ efforts to avoid talking about the death may cause the parents to isolate themselves from
their children at a time when the children most need them. Children
need to know that their parents love them and will continue to protect
them. Children need opportunities to talk about their relative’s death
and associated memories. A surviving sibling may feel guilty simply
because he or she survived, especially if the death was the result of an
accident that involved both children. Siblings’ grief, especially when
compounded by feelings of guilt, may manifest as regressive behavior
or anger. Parents should be informed of this possibility and encouraged
to discuss it with their children.

Chapter 30 u Loss, Separation, and Bereavement
Table 30.3  Recommendations for Healthcare Professionals
for Helping Children After Bereavement
•	Help children and families recognize that there is no correct way
to grieve and that every child grieves differently

•	Help caregivers recognize that child grief is not the same as adult
grief, and children express their grief reactions in very different
ways

•	Help caregivers understand that the circumstances of the death
can play a major role in children’s grief reactions, and deaths
by homicide or suicide might be especially difficult for children
(therefore could require more intensive mental healthcare)

•	Empower caregivers by explaining they can be instrumental in

facilitating adaptive grief in their children by providing empathy,
reassurance, and a listening ear, and talking openly about the
deceased person with their child

•	Help caregivers to use language accessible to children when

talking about the death, meaning that they should use simple
and straightforward language that is appropriate for the child’s
developmental stage, and let the child ask questions as opposed
to providing a lot of detailed information

•	Provide accurate information to children about the cause of

death; children can become preoccupied with thoughts about
contagion (e.g., “will I catch cancer too?”) or worries about the
caregiver’s level of suffering (e.g., “did it hurt when my dad had a
stroke?”), and healthcare professionals can help children
understand the circumstances of the death and assist in
alleviating some of these concerns

•	Never underestimate the importance of simply bearing witness

to a child’s grief; our society often sends children messages that
it is not okay to talk about their own grief, and in allowing them
the space to do that, healthcare professionals can help to both
normalize and validate their reactions.

DEVELOPMENTAL PERSPECTIVE

Children’s responses to death reflect the family’s current culture, their
past heritage, their experiences, and the sociopolitical environment.
Personal experience with terminal illness and dying may also facilitate children’s comprehension of death and familiarity with mourning.
Developmental differences exist in children’s efforts to make sense of
and master the concept and reality of death and profoundly influence
their grief reactions.
Children younger than 3 years have little or no understanding of
the concept of death. Despair, separation anxiety, and detachment may
occur at the withdrawal of nurturing caretakers. Young children may
respond in reaction to observing distress in others, such as a parent or
sibling who is crying, withdrawn, or angry. Young children also express
signs and symptoms of grief in their emotional states, such as irritability or lethargy, and in severe cases, mutism. If the reaction is severe,
failure to thrive may occur.
Preschool children are in the preoperational cognitive stage, in
which communication takes place through play and fantasy (see
Chapter 25). They do not show well-­established cause-­and-­effect
reasoning. They may feel that death is reversible, analogous to
someone going away. In attempts to master the finality and permanence of death, preschoolers frequently ask unrelenting, repeated
questions about when the person who died will be returning. This
makes it difficult for parents, who may become frustrated because
they do not understand why the child keeps asking and do not like
the constant reminders of the person’s death. The primary care provider has a very important role in helping families understand the
child’s struggle to comprehend death. Preschool children typically

199

express magical explanations of death events, sometimes resulting
in guilt and self-­blame (“He died because I wouldn’t play with him”;
“She died because I was mad at her”). Some children have these
thoughts but do not express them verbally because of embarrassment or guilt. Parents and primary care providers need to be aware
of magical thinking and must reassure preschool children that their
thoughts had nothing to do with the outcome. Children of this age
are often frightened by prolonged, powerful expressions of grief by
others. Children conceptualize events in the context of their own
experiential reality, and therefore consider death in terms of sleep,
separation, and injury. Young children express grief intermittently
and show marked affective shifts over brief periods.
Younger school-­age children think concretely, recognize that
death is irreversible, but believe it will not happen to them or affect
them, and begin to understand biologic processes of the human
body (“You’ll die if your body stops working”). Information gathered from the media, peers, and parents forms lasting impressions.
Consequently, they may ask candid questions about death that
adults will have difficulty addressing (“He must have been blown
to pieces, huh?”).
Children approximately 9 years and older do understand that death
is irreversible and that it may involve them or their families. These children tend to experience more anxiety, overt symptoms of depression,
and somatic complaints than do younger children. School-­age children
are often left with anger focused on the loved one, those who could
not save the deceased, or those presumed responsible for the death.
Contact with the primary care clinician may provide great reassurance,
especially for the child with somatic symptoms, and particularly when
the death followed a medical illness. School and learning problems may
also occur, often linked to difficulty concentrating or preoccupation
with the death. Close collaboration with the child’s school may provide
important diagnostic information and offer opportunities to mobilize
intervention or support.
At 12-­14 years of age, children begin to use symbolic thinking,
reason abstractly, and analyze hypothetical, or “what if,” scenarios
systematically. Death and the end of life become concepts rather
than events. Teenagers are often ambivalent about dependence
and independence and may withdraw emotionally from surviving
family members, only to mourn in isolation. Adolescents begin to
understand complex physiologic systems in relationship to death.
Because they are often egocentric, they may be more concerned
about the impact of the death on themselves than about the deceased
or other family members. Fascination with dramatic, sensational,
or romantic death sometimes occurs and may find expression in
copycat behavior, such as cluster suicides, as well as competitive
behavior, to forge emotional links to the deceased person (“He was
my best friend”). Somatic expression of grief may revolve around
highly complex syndromes such as eating disorders (see Chapter
41) or conversion reactions (Chapter 35), as well as symptoms limited to the more immediate perceptions (stomachaches). Quality
of life takes on meaning, and the teenager develops a focus on the
future. Depression, resentment, mood swings, rage, and risk-­taking
behaviors can emerge as the adolescent seeks answers to questions
of values, safety, evil, and fairness. Alternately, adolescents may seek
philosophic or spiritual explanations (“being at peace”) to ease their
sense of loss. The death of a peer may be especially traumatic.
Families often struggle with how to inform their children of the
death of a family member. The answer depends on the child’s developmental level. It is best to avoid misleading euphemisms and metaphor. A child who is told that the relative who died “went to sleep”
may become frightened of falling asleep, resulting in sleep problems
or nightmares. Children can be told that the person is “no longer living” or “no longer moving or feeling.” Using examples of pets that
have died sometimes can help children gain a more realistic idea of
the meaning of death. Parents who have religious beliefs may comfort their children with explanations, such as, “Your sister’s soul is in
heaven,” or “Grandfather is now with God,” provided those beliefs are
honestly held. If these are not religious beliefs that the parents share,
children will sense the insincerity and experience anxiety rather than

the hoped-­for reassurance. Children’s books about death can provide
an important source of information, and when read together, these
books may help the parent to find the right words while addressing
the child’s needs.

ROLE OF THE PEDIATRIC HEALTHCARE PROVIDER
IN GRIEF

The pediatric healthcare provider who has had a longitudinal relationship with the family will be an important source of support in
the disclosure of bad news and in critical decision-­making, during
both the dying process and the bereavement period (see Table 30.3).
The involvement of the healthcare provider may include being present at the time the diagnosis is disclosed, at the hospital or home
at the time of death, being available to the family by phone during
the bereavement period, sending a sympathy card, attending the
funeral, and scheduling a follow-­up visit. Attendance at the funeral
sends a strong message that the family and their child are important, respected by the healthcare provider, and can also help the
pediatric healthcare provider to grieve and reach personal closure
about the death. A family meeting 1-­3 months later may be helpful because parents may not be able to formulate their questions
at the time of death. This meeting allows the family time to ask
questions, share concerns, and review autopsy findings (if one was
performed), and allows the healthcare provider to determine how
the parents and family are adjusting to the death.
Instead of leaving the family feeling abandoned by a healthcare system that they have counted on, this visit allows them to have continued
support. This is even more important when the healthcare provider
will be continuing to provide care for surviving siblings. The visit can
be used to determine how the mourning process is progressing, detect
evidence of marital discord, and evaluate how well surviving siblings
are coping. This is also an opportunity to evaluate whether referrals to
support groups or mental health providers may be of benefit. Continuing to recognize the child who has died is important. Families appreciate the receipt of a card on their child’s birthday, around holidays, or
the anniversary of their child’s death.
The healthcare provider needs to be an educator about disease,
death, and grief. The pediatrician can offer a safe environment for
the family to talk about painful emotions, express fears, and share
memories. By giving families permission to talk and modeling how
to address children’s concerns, the clinician demystifies death. Parents often request practical help. The healthcare provider can offer
families resources, such as literature (both fiction and nonfiction),
referrals to therapeutic services, and tools to help them learn about
illness, loss, and grief. In this way the physician reinforces the sense
that other people understand what they are going through and helps
to normalize their distressing emotions. The healthcare provider
can also facilitate and demystify the grief process by sharing basic
tenets of grief therapy. There is no single right or wrong way to
grieve. Everyone grieves differently; mothers may grieve differently
than fathers, and children mourn differently than adults. Helping
family members to respect these differences and reach out to support each other is critical. Grief is not something to “get over,” but a
lifelong process of adapting, readjusting, and reconnecting.
Parents may need help in knowing what constitutes normal grieving. Hearing, seeing, or feeling their child’s presence may be a normal
response. Vivid memories or dreams may occur. The healthcare provider can help parents to learn that, although their pain and sadness
may seem intolerable, other parents have survived similar experiences,
and their pain will lessen over time.
Healthcare providers are often asked whether children should attend
the funeral of a parent or sibling. These rituals allow the family to
begin their mourning process. Children >4 years old should be given
a choice. If the child chooses to attend, the child should have a designated, trusted adult who is not part of the immediate family and who
will stay with the child, offer comfort, and be willing to leave with the
child if the experience proves to be overwhelming. If the child chooses
not to attend, the child should be offered additional opportunities to
share in a ritual, go to the cemetery to view the grave, tell stories about

the deceased, or obtain a keepsake object from the deceased family
member as a remembrance.
In the era of regionalized tertiary care medicine, the primary care
provider and medical home staff may not be informed when one of
their patients dies in the hospital. Yet, this communication is critically important. Families assume their primary care provider has
been notified and often feel hurt when they do not receive some
symbol of condolence. Because of their longitudinal relationship
with the family, primary care providers may offer much needed
support. There are practical issues, such as the need to cancel previously made appointments and to alert office and nursing staff so
that they are prepared should the family return for a follow-­up visit
or for ongoing health maintenance care with the surviving siblings.
Even minor illnesses in the surviving siblings may frighten children. Parents may contribute to this anxiety because their inability to protect the child who has died may leave them with a sense
of guilt or helplessness. They may seek medical attention sooner
or may be hypervigilant in the care of the siblings because of guilt
over the other child’s death, concern about their judgment, or the
need for continued reassurance. A primary care visit can do much
to allay their fears.
Clinicians must remain vigilant for risk factors in each family member and in the family unit as a whole. Primary care providers, who care
for families over time, know bereft patients’ premorbid functioning
and can identify those at current or future risk for physical and psychiatric morbidity. Providers must focus on symptoms that interfere
with a patient’s normal activities and compromise a child’s attainment
of developmental tasks. Symptom duration, intensity, and severity, in
context with the family’s culture, can help identify complicated grief
reactions in need of therapeutic attention (see Table 30.2). Descriptive words such as “unrelenting,” “intense,” “intrusive,” or “prolonged”
should raise concern. Total absence of signs of mourning, specifically
an inability to discuss the loss or express sadness, also suggests potential problems.
No specific sign, symptom, or cluster of behaviors identifies the
child or family in need of help. Further assessment is indicated if
the following occur: (1) persistent somatic or psychosomatic complaints of undetermined origin (headache, stomachache, eating and
sleeping disorders, conversion symptoms, symptoms related to the
deceased’s condition, hypochondriasis); (2) unusual circumstances
of death or loss (sudden, violent, or traumatic death; inexplicable,
unbelievable, or particularly senseless death; prolonged, complicated illness; unexpected separation); (3) school or work difficulties
(declining grades or school performance, social withdrawal, aggression); (4) changes in home or family functioning (multiple family
stresses, lack of social support, unavailable or ineffective functioning of caretakers, multiple disruptions in routines, lack of safety);
and (5) concerning psychologic factors (persistent guilt or blame,
desire to die or talk of suicide, severe separation distress, disturbing hallucinations, self-­abuse, risk-­taking behaviors, symptoms of
trauma such as hyperarousal or severe flashbacks, grief from previous or multiple deaths). Children who are intellectually impaired
may require additional support.

TREATMENT

Suggesting interventions outside the natural support network of family and friends can often prove useful to grieving families. Bereavement counseling should be readily offered if needed or requested by
the family. Interventions that enhance or promote attachments and
security, as well as give the family a means of expressing and understanding death, help to reduce the likelihood of future or prolonged
disturbance, especially in children. Collaboration between pediatric
and mental health professionals can help determine the timing and
appropriateness of services.
Interventions for children and families who are struggling to
cope with a loss in the community include gestures such as sending
a card or offering food to the relatives of the deceased and teaching
children the etiquette of behaviors and rituals around bereavement
and mutual support. Performing community service or joining

Chapter 31 u Sleep Medicine
charitable organizations, such as fund-­raising in memory of the
deceased, may be useful. In the wake of a disaster, parents and older
siblings can give blood or volunteer in search and recovery efforts.
When a loss does not involve an actual death (e.g., parental divorce,
geographic relocation), empowering the child to join or start a
“divorced kids’ club” in school or planning a “new kids in town”
party may help. Participating in a constructive activity moves the
family away from a sense of helplessness and hopelessness and helps
them find meaning in their loss.
Psychotherapeutic services may benefit the entire family or
individual members. Many support or self-­help groups focus on
specific types of losses (sudden infant death syndrome, suicide,
widow/widowers, AIDS) and provide an opportunity to talk with
other people who have experienced similar losses. Family, couple,
sibling, or individual counseling may be useful, depending on the
nature of the residual coping issues. Combinations of approaches
may work well for children or parents with evolving needs. A child
may participate in family therapy to deal with the loss of a sibling
and use individual treatment to address issues of personal ambivalence and guilt related to the death.
The question of pharmacologic intervention for grief reactions
often arises. Explaining that medication does not cure grief and
often does not reduce the intensity of some symptoms (separation
distress) can help. Although medication can blunt reactions, the psychologic work of grieving still must occur. The physician must consider the patient’s premorbid psychiatric vulnerability, current level
of functioning, other available supports, and the use of additional
therapeutic interventions. Medication as a first line of defense rarely
proves useful in normal or uncomplicated grief reactions. In certain
situations (severe sleep disruption, incapacitating anxiety, intense
hyperarousal), an anxiolytic or antidepressant may help to achieve
symptom relief and provide the patient with the emotional energy
to mourn. Medication used in conjunction with some form of psychotherapy, and in consultation with a psychopharmacologist, has
optimal results.
Children who are refugees and may have experienced war, violence, or personal torture, while often resilient, may experience posttraumatic stress disorder if exposures were severe or repeated (see
Chapters 15.3 and 38). Sequelae such as depression, anxiety, and
grief need to be addressed, and mental health therapy is indicated.
Cognitive-­
behavioral therapy, use of journaling and narratives
to bear witness to the experiences, and use of translators may be
essential.

SPIRITUAL ISSUES

Responding to patients’ and families’ spiritual beliefs can help in
comforting them during family tragedies. Offering to call members of pastoral care teams or their own spiritual leader can provide needed support and can aid in decision-­making. Families have
found it important to have their beliefs and their need for hope
acknowledged in end-­of-­life care. The majority of patients report
welcoming discussions on spirituality, which may help individual
patients cope with illness, disease, dying, and death. In addressing
spirituality, physicians need to follow certain guidelines, including
maintaining respect for the patient’s beliefs, following the patient’s
lead in exploring how spirituality affects the patient’s decision-­
making, acknowledging the limits of their own expertise and role
in spirituality, and maintaining their own integrity by not saying or
doing anything that violates their own spiritual or religious views.
Healthcare providers should not impose their own religious or nonreligious beliefs on patients, but rather should listen respectfully to
their patients. By responding to spiritual needs, clinicians may better aid their patients and families in end-­of-­life care and bereavement and take on the role of healers.

Sleep Medicine
Judith A. Owens and Seyni Gueye-­Ndiaye
BASICS OF SLEEP AND CHRONOBIOLOGY

Sleep and wakefulness are a highly complex and intricately regulated
neurobiologic system that both influences and is influenced by all physiologic systems in the body, as well as by the environment and sociocultural practices. The concept of sleep regulation is based on what
is usually referred to as the “two-­process model” because it requires
the simultaneous operation of two basic, highly coupled processes that
govern sleep and wakefulness. The homeostatic process (“Process S”),
regulates the length and depth of sleep and is thought to be related to
the accumulation of adenosine and other sleep-­promoting chemicals
(“somnogens”), such as cytokines, during prolonged periods of wakefulness. This sleep pressure appears to build more quickly in infants
and young children, thus limiting the duration that wakefulness can
be sustained during the day and necessitating periods of daytime sleep
(i.e., naps). The endogenous circadian rhythms (“Process C”) influence the internal organization of sleep and the timing and duration of
daily sleep–wake cycles and govern predictable patterns of alertness
throughout the 24-­hour day.
The “master circadian clock” or “circadian pacemaker” that controls
sleep–wake patterns, of which melatonin secretion is the principal biomarker, is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the anterior hypothalamus. In addition, “circadian clocks” are present in virtually every
cell in the body, which in turn govern the timing of multiple other
physiologic systems (e.g., cardiovascular reactivity, hormone levels,
renal and pulmonary functions). Because the human circadian clock
is slightly longer than 24 hours, intrinsic circadian rhythms must be
synchronized or “entrained” to the 24 hour-­day cycle by environmental
cues called zeitgebers. The dark-­light cycle is the most powerful of the
zeitgebers; light signals are transmitted to the suprachiasmatic nucleus
via the circadian photoreceptor system within the retina (functionally
and anatomically separate from the visual system), which switch the
pineal gland’s production of the hormone melatonin off (light) or on
(dark). Circadian rhythms are also synchronized by other external time
cues, such as timing of meals and clock time.
Sleep propensity, the relative level of sleepiness or alertness experienced at any given time during a 24-­hour period, is partially determined
by the homeostatic sleep drive, which in turn depends on the duration
and quality of previous sleep and the amount of time awake since the
last sleep period. Interacting with this sleep homeostat is the 24-­hour
cyclic pattern or rhythm characterized by clock-­dependent periods of
maximum sleepiness and maximum alertness. There are two periods
of maximum sleepiness, one in the late afternoon (approximately 3:00-­
5:00 pm) and one toward the end of the night (around 3:00-­5:00 am),
and two periods of maximum alertness, one in mid-­morning and one
in the evening just before the onset of natural sleep, the so-­called forbidden zone or second-­wind phenomenon, which allows for the maintenance of wakefulness in the face of an accumulated sleep drive.
There are significant health, safety, and performance consequences
of failure to meet basic sleep needs, termed insufficient/inadequate sleep
or sleep loss. Sufficient sleep is a biologic imperative, necessary for
optimal brain and body functioning. Slow-­wave sleep (SWS) (i.e., N3,
delta, or deep sleep) appears to be the most restorative form of sleep;
it is entered relatively quickly after sleep onset, is preserved in the face
of reduced total sleep time and increases (rebounds) after a night of
restricted sleep. These restorative properties of sleep may be linked to
the “glymphatic system,” which increases clearance of metabolic waste

202 Part II u Growth, Development, and Behavior

DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES IN SLEEP

Sleep disturbances, as well as many characteristics of sleep itself, have
some distinctly different features in children from sleep and sleep disorders in adults. Changes in sleep architecture and the evolution of
sleep patterns and behaviors reflect the physiologic/chronobiologic,
developmental, and social/environmental changes that are occurring
across childhood. These trends may be summarized as the gradual
assumption of more adult sleep patterns as children mature (Figs. 31.1
and 31.2):
1.	Sleep is the primary activity of the brain during early development;
for example, by age 2 years, the average child has spent 9,500 hours
(approximately 13 months) asleep vs 8,000 hours awake, and between 2 and 5 years, the time asleep is equal to the time awake.
2.	There is a gradual decline in the average 24-­hour sleep duration from
infancy through adolescence, which involves a decrease in both diurnal and nocturnal sleep amounts. The decline in daytime sleep
(scheduled napping) results in termination of naps typically by age
5 years, although there is clearly considerable variability in the age

products, including β-­amyloid, produced by neural activity in the
awake brain. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (stage R or “dream”
sleep) appears to be involved in numerous important brain processes,
including completion of vital cognitive functions (e.g., consolidation
of memory), promoting the plasticity of the central nervous system
(CNS), and protecting the brain from injury. Sufficient amounts of
these sleep stages are necessary for optimal cognitive functioning and
emotional and behavioral self-­regulation.
Partial sleep loss (i.e., sleep restriction) on a chronic basis accumulates in a sleep debt and over several days produces deficits equivalent
to those seen under conditions of one night of total sleep deprivation.
If the sleep debt becomes large enough and is not voluntarily repaid by
obtaining sufficient recovery sleep, the body may respond by overriding voluntary control of wakefulness. This results in periods of decreased
alertness, dozing off, and unplanned napping, recognized as excessive
daytime sleepiness (EDS). The sleep-­restricted individual may also experience very brief (several seconds) repeated daytime microsleeps, of
which the individual may be completely unaware, but which nonetheless
may result in significant lapses in attention and vigilance. There is also a
relationship between the amount of sleep restriction and performance
on cognitive tasks, particularly those requiring sustained attention and
higher-­level cognitive skills (executive functions; see Chapter 49), with a
decay in performance correlating with declines in sleep amounts.
It has also been recognized that what may be globally described
as “deficient” sleep involves alterations in both amount and timing of
sleep. Misalignment of intrinsic circadian rhythms with extrinsic societal demands, such a shift work and early school start times, is associated with deficits in cognitive function and self-­regulation, increased
emotional and behavioral problems and risk-­taking behaviors, and
negative impacts on health, such as increased risk of cardiovascular
disease, obesity, and metabolic dysfunction.
Insufficient quantity of sleep, mistimed sleep, and poor-­quality sleep
frequently result in EDS and decreased daytime alertness levels. Sleepiness in children may be recognizable as drowsiness, yawning, and other
classic “sleepy behaviors” as well as resumption of napping in older
children and extending sleep when given the opportunity such as on
weekends. If a child can sleep more, they need more sleep. EDS can also
manifest as mood disturbance, including irritability, emotional lability,
low frustration tolerance and depressed or negative mood; fatigue and
daytime lethargy, including increased somatic complaints (headaches,
gastrointestinal disturbances); cognitive impairment, including problems with memory, attention, concentration, decision-­making, and
problem solving; daytime behavior problems, including hyperactivity,
impulsivity, and noncompliance; and academic problems, including
chronic tardiness related to insufficient sleep and school failure. While
sleepiness and fatigue may overlap in their clinical presentation, sleepiness is characterized by the propensity to fall asleep, particularly under
conditions of low stimulation (e.g., riding in the car), while fatigue is
often described as a state of low energy, decreased motivation, and
“exhaustion.”

at which children cease napping. There is also a gradual continued
decrease in nocturnal sleep amounts into late adolescence; however,
adolescents still require 8-­10 hours of sleep per night.
3.	There is also a decline in the relative percentage of REM sleep from
birth (50% of sleep) through early childhood into adulthood (25–
30%), and a similar initial predominance of SWS that peaks in early
childhood, drops off abruptly after puberty (40–60% decline), and
then further decreases over the life span. This SWS preponderance
in early life has clinical significance; for example, the high prevalence
of partial arousal parasomnias (sleepwalking and sleep terrors) in
preschool- and early school–age children is related to the relative
increased percentage of SWS in this age-­group.
4.	The within-­sleep ultradian cycle lengthens from about 50 minutes
in the term infant to 90-­110 minutes in the school-­age child. This
has clinical significance in that typically a brief arousal or awakening occurs during the night at the termination of each ultradian
cycle. As the length of the cycles increase, there is a concomitant
decrease in the number of these end-­of-­cycle arousals (night wakings).
5.	A gradual shift in the circadian sleep–wake rhythm to a delayed
(later) sleep onset and offset time, linked to pubertal stage rather
than chronologic age, begins with pubertal onset in middle childhood and accelerates in early to mid-­adolescence. This biologic phenomenon often coincides with environmental factors, which further
delay bedtime and advance wake time and result in insufficient sleep
duration, including exposure to electronic “screens” in the evening,
social networking, academic and extracurricular demands, and early
(before 8:30 am) high school start times. In addition, the accumulation of the homeostatic sleep drive across the day slows and both
sensitivity and exposure to evening light increases (especially blue
spectrum light from electronic devices) during adolescence, conspiring to further delay sleep onset.
6.	Increasing irregularity of sleep–wake patterns is typically observed
across childhood into adolescence; this is characterized by increasingly larger discrepancies between school night and non–school
night bedtimes and wake times, and increased “weekend oversleep”
in an attempt to compensate for chronic weekday sleep insufficiency.
This phenomenon, often referred to as “social jet lag,” not only fails
to adequately address performance deficits associated with insufficient sleep on school nights but further exacerbates the normal
adolescent phase delay and results in additional circadian disruption
(analogous to that experienced by shift workers).
Table 31.1 lists normal developmental changes in children’s sleep.

COMMON SLEEP DISORDERS

Childhood sleep problems may be conceptualized as resulting from
(1) inadequate duration of sleep for age and sleep needs (insufficient
sleep quantity); (2) disruption and fragmentation of sleep (poor

sleep quality) as a result of frequent, repetitive, and brief arousals
during sleep; (3) misalignment of sleep–wake timing with circadian
rhythms; or (4) CNS-­mediated hypersomnia (EDS and increased
sleep needs). Insufficient sleep is usually the result of difficulty initiating (delayed sleep onset) or maintaining sleep (prolonged night
wakings) but, especially in older children and adolescents, may also
represent a conscious lifestyle decision to sacrifice sleep in favor of
competing priorities, such as homework and social activities. The
underlying causes of delayed sleep onset/prolonged night wakings or
sleep fragmentation may in turn be related to primarily behavioral
factors (e.g., bedtime resistance resulting in shortened sleep duration) or medical causes (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea [OSA] causing
frequent, brief arousals).
Certain pediatric populations are relatively more vulnerable
to acute or chronic sleep problems. These include children with
chronic illnesses or pain conditions (e.g., cystic fibrosis, asthma,
idiopathic juvenile arthritis) and acute illnesses (e.g., otitis media);
children taking stimulants (e.g., psychostimulants, caffeine), sleep-­
disrupting medications (e.g., corticosteroids), or daytime-­sedating
medications (some anticonvulsants, α-­agonists); hospitalized children; and children with a variety of psychiatric disorders, including
attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders. Children with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, intellectual disability, blindness,
and some chromosomal syndromes (e.g., Smith-­Magenis, fragile X)
have especially high rates of sleep disturbances for a wide variety
of reasons. They may have comorbid medical issues or may be taking sleep-­disrupting medications, may be more prone to nocturnal
seizures, may be less easily entrained by environmental cues and
thus more vulnerable to circadian disruption, and are more likely
to have psychiatric and behavioral comorbidities that further predispose them to disrupted sleep. Children from low socioeconomic
households or minoritized racial and ethnic groups, as well as children in alternative care such as foster placement, are more likely
to experience, are less likely to be diagnosed and treated, and are
more vulnerable to the negative impact of sleep disorders resulting
in significant sleep health disparities.

Insomnia of Childhood

Insomnia is defined as difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep
that occurs despite age-­appropriate time and opportunity for sleep
and results in some degree of impairment in daytime functioning
for the child and/or family (ranging from fatigue, irritability, lack of
energy, and mild cognitive impairment to effects on mood, school
performance, and quality of life). Insomnia may be of a short-­term
and transient nature (usually related to an acute event) or may be
characterized as long-­term and chronic. Insomnia is a set of symptoms with many possible etiologies (e.g., pain, medication, medical/

psychiatric conditions, learned behaviors). As with many behavioral
issues in children, insomnia is often primarily defined by parental
concerns rather than by objective criteria and therefore should be
viewed in the context of family (maternal depression, stress), child
(temperament, developmental level), and environmental (cultural
practices, sleeping space) considerations.
While current terminology (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, 2015; International Classification
of Sleep Disorders, 3rd edition, 2014) groups most types of insomnia in both children and adults under a single category of Chronic
Insomnia Disorder, the descriptor of Behavioral Insomnia of Childhood and its subtypes (Sleep Onset Association and Limit Setting)
remains a useful construct in clinical practice, particularly for
young children (0-­5 years). One of the most common presentations
of insomnia found in infants and toddlers is the sleep-­onset association type. In this situation the child learns to fall asleep only under
certain conditions or associations, which typically require parental
presence, such as being rocked or fed, and does not develop the
ability to self-­soothe. During the night, when the child experiences
the type of brief arousal that normally occurs at the end of an ultradian sleep cycle or awakens for other reasons, the child is not able
to get back to sleep without those same associations being present. The infant then “signals” the parent by crying (or coming into
the parents’ bedroom if the child is ambulatory) until the necessary
associations are provided. The presenting complaint is typically one
of prolonged night waking requiring caregiver intervention and
resulting in insufficient sleep (for both child and caregiver).
Management of night wakings should include establishment of
a set sleep schedule and bedtime routine and implementation of
a behavioral program. The treatment approach typically involves
a program of rapid withdrawal (extinction) or more gradual withdrawal (graduated extinction) of parental assistance at sleep onset
and during the night. Extinction (“cry it out”) involves putting the
child to bed at a designated bedtime, “drowsy but awake,” to maximize sleep propensity and then systematically ignoring any protests
by the child until a set time the next morning. Although it has considerable empirical support, extinction is often not an acceptable
choice for families. Graduated extinction (aka “check-­ins,” “Ferber method,” “sleep training”) involves gradually weaning the child
from dependence on parental presence; typically, the parent leaves
the room at “lights out” and then returns or “checks” periodically at
fixed or successively longer intervals during the sleep–wake transition to provide brief reassurance until the child falls asleep. The
exact interval between checks is generally determined by the parents’ tolerance for crying and the child’s temperament; the goal is
to allow enough time between checks for the child to fall asleep
independently while avoiding extended time intervals that result
in continued escalation of protest behaviors such as screaming and

SLEEP DISORDERS

Newborn (0-­2 mo)

⦁	Total sleep: 10-­19 hr per 24 hr
(average, 13-­14.5 hr), may be
higher in premature babies.
⦁	Bottle-­fed babies
generally sleep for longer
periods (2-­5 hr bouts) than
breastfed babies (1-­3 hr).
⦁	Sleep periods are separated
by 1-­2 hr awake.
⦁	No established
nocturnal-­diurnal pattern in
first few wk; sleep is evenly
distributed throughout the
day and night, averaging 8.5
hr at night and 5.75 hr during
day.

⦁	American Academy of Pediatrics issued a
revised recommendation in 2016 advocating
against bed-­sharing in the first year of life,
instead encouraging proximate but separate
sleeping surfaces for mother and infant for at
least the first 6 mo and preferably first year of
life.
⦁	Safe sleep practices for infants:
⦁	Place baby on his or her back to sleep at
night and during nap times.
⦁	Place baby on a firm mattress with
well-­fitting sheet in safety-­approved crib.
⦁	Do not use pillows or comforters.
⦁	Standards require crib bars to be no farther
apart than 2 3/8 in.
⦁	Make sure baby’s face and head stay
uncovered and clear of blankets and other
coverings during sleep.

⦁	Most sleep issues perceived
as problematic at this stage
represent a discrepancy
between parental expectations
and developmentally
appropriate sleep behaviors.
⦁	Newborns who are extremely
fussy and persistently difficult
to console, as noted by
parents, are more likely to
have underlying medical issues
such as colic, gastroesophageal
reflux, and formula intolerance.

Infant (2-­12 mo)

⦁	Recommended sleep duration
(4-­12 mo) is 12-­16 hr (note that
there is great individual
variability in sleep times
during infancy).

⦁	Sleep regulation or self-­soothing involves the
infant’s ability to negotiate the sleep–wake
transition, both at sleep onset and following
normal awakenings throughout the night. The
capacity to self-­soothe begins to develop in
the first 12 wk of life and is a reflection of both
neurodevelopmental maturation and learning.
⦁	Sleep consolidation, or “sleeping through
the night,” is usually defined by parents as a
continuous sleep episode without the need for
parental intervention (e.g., feeding, soothing)
from the child’s bedtime through the early
morning. Infants develop the ability to
consolidate sleep between 6 wk and 3 mo.

gagging/vomiting. This allows the infant or child to develop the
skills necessary for self-­soothing at bedtime and also during the
night. Sleep training is typically not instituted until about 6 months
of age, but the practice of putting the infant to sleep “drowsy but

awake” starting at 3-­4 months to encourage self-­soothing may avoid
the need for later intervention. In older infants and young children, the introduction of more appropriate sleep associations that

Chapter 31 u Sleep Medicine
objects, such as a blanket or toy), in addition to positive reinforcement (stickers for remaining in bed), is often beneficial. As healthy,
normally growing full-­term infants no longer need night feedings
from a nutritional standpoint, if the child has become habituated
to awaken for nighttime feedings (learned hunger), these feedings
should be eliminated (either “cold turkey” or by gradually decreasing volume and the milk:water ratio). Parents must be consistent in
applying behavioral interventions to avoid inadvertent, intermittent
reinforcement of night wakings. They should also be forewarned
that crying behavior often temporarily escalates at the beginning of
treatment (postextinction burst).
Bedtime problems, including stalling and refusing to go to bed,
are more common in preschool-­age and older children. This type of
insomnia is frequently related to inadequate limit setting at bedtime
such as an inability or unwillingness to set consistent bedtime rules,
and enforce a regular bedtime. In some cases, caregivers have adopted
an inconsistent approach to night wakings that involves intermittently
allowing the child to share their bed. This type of sleep problem may
be associated with parental difficulty in setting limits or managing
behavior in general and may be exacerbated by a child’s tendency to
engage in oppositional behavior. In some cases, the child’s resistance at
bedtime is the result of an underlying problem in falling asleep that is
caused by other factors (medical conditions such as asthma or medication use; a sleep disorder such as restless legs syndrome; anxiety) or a
mismatch between the child’s intrinsic circadian rhythm (“night owl”)
and parental expectations regarding an “appropriate” bedtime.
Successful treatment of limit-­
setting sleep problems generally
involves a combination of parent education regarding appropriate limit
setting, decreased parental attention for bedtime-­delaying behavior,
establishment of bedtime routines, and positive reinforcement (sticker
charts) for appropriate behavior at bedtime and during the night. For
problematic night wakings, it is essential for caregivers to have a consistent response (e.g., returning the child to their bedroom after every
night waking). Other behavioral management strategies that have
empirical support include bedtime fading, or temporarily setting
the bedtime closer to the actual sleep-­onset time and then gradually
advancing the bedtime to an earlier target bedtime. Older children may
benefit from being taught relaxation techniques to help themselves fall
asleep or back to sleep more readily. Following the principles of healthy
sleep practices for children is essential (Table 31.2).
A third type of childhood insomnia is related to a mismatch between
parental expectations regarding time in bed and the child’s intrinsic
sleep needs. If, as illustrated in Figure 31.3, a child’s typical sleep time
is 10 hours but the “sleep window” is set for 12 hours (7 pm to 7 am),
the result is likely to be a prolonged sleep onset of 2 hours, an extended
period of wakefulness during the night, or early morning waking (or
a combination); these periods are usually characterized by “normal”
wakefulness in the child that is not accompanied by excessive distress.
This situation is important to recognize because the solution (reducing
the time in bed to actual sleep time) is typically simple and effective.
Another form of insomnia that is more common in older children and adolescents has often been referred to as psychophysiologic,
primary, or learned insomnia. Primary insomnia occurs mainly in
adolescents and is characterized by a combination of learned sleep-­
preventing associations and heightened physiologic arousal resulting
in a complaint of sleeplessness and decreased daytime functioning. A
hallmark of primary insomnia is excessive worry about sleep and an
exaggerated concern of the potential daytime consequences. The physiologic arousal can be in the form of cognitive hypervigilance, such
as “racing” thoughts; in many individuals with insomnia, an increased
baseline level of arousal is further intensified by this secondary anxiety about sleeplessness. Treatment usually involves educating the adolescent about the principles of healthy sleep practices (Table 31.3),
institution of a consistent sleep–wake schedule, avoidance of daytime
napping, instructions to use the bed for sleep only and to get out of bed
if unable to fall asleep (stimulus control), restricting time in bed to the
actual time asleep (sleep restriction), addressing maladaptive cognitions
about sleep, and teaching relaxation techniques to reduce anxiety (cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia [CBT-­I]).

Table 31.2  Basic Principles of Healthy Sleep for Children
1.	Have a set bedtime and bedtime routine for your child.
2.	Bedtime and wake-­up time should be about the same time on
school nights and non–school nights. There should not be more
than about 1 hr difference from one day to another.
3.	Make the hour before bed shared quiet time. Avoid high-­energy
activities, such as rough play, and stimulating activities, such as
watching television or playing computer games, just before bed.
4.	Don’t send your child to bed hungry. A light snack (e.g., milk
and cookies) before bed is a good idea. Heavy meals within 1 hr
or 2 of bedtime, however, may interfere with sleep.
5.	Avoid products containing caffeine for at least several hours
before bedtime. These include caffeinated sodas, coffee, tea,
and chocolate.
6.	Make sure your child spends time outside every day, whenever
possible, and is involved in regular exercise.
7.	Keep your child’s bedroom quiet and dark. A low-­level night
light is acceptable for children who find completely dark rooms
frightening.
8.	Keep your child’s bedroom at a comfortable temperature during
the night (<24°C [75°F]).
9.	Don’t use your child’s bedroom for time-­out or punishment.
10.	Keep the television out of your child’s bedroom. Children can
easily develop the bad habit of “needing” the television to fall
asleep. It is also much more difficult to control your child’s viewing
if the set is in the bedroom.

The keys to successful behavioral sleep interventions involve forming an alliance with the family, negotiating tailored solutions that are
more likely to be effective if families can be successful in implementing
them, and setting appropriate agreed-­on treatment goals with planned
follow-­up. Behavioral treatments for insomnia, even in young children,
appear to be highly effective and well tolerated. Several studies have
failed to demonstrate long-­term negative effects of behavioral strategies
such as “sleep training” on parent–child relationships and attachment,
psychosocial-­emotional functioning, and chronic stress. It should also
be emphasized that, as in adults, behavioral interventions are the first-­
line treatment for insomnia in children, and in general, hypnotic medications or supplements such as melatonin are infrequently needed and
should only be used as an adjunct to behavioral therapy to treat insomnia in typically developing and healthy children. If cognitive behavior therapy and sleep hygiene practices are ineffective in children with
autism spectrum disorders or ADHD, melatonin may be an additional
effective therapy.

1.	Wake up and go to bed at about the same time every night.
Bedtime and wake-­up time should not differ from school to
non–school nights by more than approximately 1 hr.
2.	Avoid sleeping in on weekends to “catch up” on sleep. This
makes it more likely that you will have problems falling asleep.
3.	If you take naps, they should be short (no more than 1 hr) and
scheduled in the early to mid-­afternoon. However, if you have
a problem with falling asleep at night, napping during the day
may make it worse and should be avoided.
4.	Spend time outside every day. Exposure to sunlight helps to
keep your body’s internal clock on track.
5.	Exercise regularly. Exercise may help you fall asleep and sleep
more deeply.

music, or watch television on your bed.

or listening to calm music, help your body and mind slow down
enough to let you get to sleep. Don’t study, watch exciting/scary
movies, exercise, or get involved in “energizing” activities just
before bed.
8.	Eat regular meals, and don’t go to bed hungry. A light snack
before bed is a good idea; eating a full meal within 1 hr before
bed is not.
9.	Avoid eating or drinking products containing caffeine from
dinnertime to bedtime. These include caffeinated sodas, coffee,
tea, and chocolate.
10.	Do not use alcohol. Alcohol disrupts sleep and may cause you
to awaken throughout the night.
11.	Smoking (e.g., cigarettes) disturbs sleep. Although you should
not smoke at all, if you do, do not smoke at least 2 hr before
bed.
12.	Do not use sleeping pills, melatonin, or other nonprescription
sleep aids to help you sleep unless specifically recommended by
your doctor. These can be dangerous, and the sleep problems
often return when you stop taking the medicine.

Obstructive Sleep Apnea

Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in children encompasses a broad
spectrum of respiratory disorders that occur exclusively in sleep or that
are exacerbated by sleep, including primary snoring and upper airway resistance syndrome, as well as apnea of prematurity (see Chapter
125) and central apnea (see Chapter 468.2). OSA, the most important
clinical entity within the SDB spectrum, is characterized by repeated
episodes of prolonged upper airway obstruction during sleep despite
continued or increased respiratory effort, resulting in complete (apnea)
or partial (hypopnea; ≥30% reduction in airflow accompanied by ≥3%
O2 desaturation and/or arousal) cessation of airflow at the nose and/
or mouth, as well as disrupted sleep. Both intermittent hypoxia and
the multiple arousals resulting from these obstructive events likely contribute to significant metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurocognitive-­
neurobehavioral morbidity.
Primary snoring is defined as snoring without associated ventilatory abnormalities on overnight polysomnogram (PSG) (e.g., no
apneas or hypopneas, hypoxemia, hypercapnia) or respiratory-­related
arousals and is a manifestation of the vibrations of the oropharyngeal
soft tissue walls that occur when an individual attempts to breathe
against increased upper airway resistance during sleep. Although generally considered nonpathologic, primary snoring in children may still
be associated with subtle breathing abnormalities during sleep, including evidence of increased respiratory effort, which in turn may be associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes that may be similar
to those associated with OSA.

Etiology

OSA results from an anatomically or functionally narrowed upper
airway; this typically involves some combination of decreased upper

airway patency (upper airway obstruction and/or decreased upper airway diameter), increased upper airway collapsibility (reduced pharyngeal muscle tone), and decreased drive to breathe in the face of reduced
upper airway patency (reduced central ventilatory drive) (Table 31.4).
Upper airway obstruction varies in degree and level (i.e., nose, nasopharynx/oropharynx, hypopharynx) and is most frequently caused by
adenotonsillar hypertrophy, although tonsillar size does not necessarily
correlate with degree of obstruction, especially in older children. Other
causes of airway obstruction include allergies associated with chronic
rhinitis or nasal obstruction; craniofacial abnormalities, including
hypoplasia or displacement of the maxilla and mandible; gastroesophageal reflux with resulting pharyngeal reactive edema (see Chapter 369);
nasal septal deviation (Chapter 425); and velopharyngeal flap cleft palate repair. Reduced upper airway tone may result from neuromuscular
diseases, including hypotonic cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophies
(see Chapter 649), or hypothyroidism (Chapter 603). Reduced central
ventilatory drive may be present in some children with Arnold-­Chiari
malformation (see Chapter 631.09); rapid-­onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation
(Chapter 65); and meningomyelocele (Chapter 631.04). In other situations, the etiology is mixed; individuals with Down syndrome (see
Chapter 57), because of their facial anatomy, hypotonia, macroglossia,
and central adiposity, as well as the increased incidence of hypothyroidism, are at particularly high risk for OSA, with some estimates of
prevalence as high as 70%.
Although children with OSA may be of normal weight, a large
percentage are overweight or obese, and many of these children are
school-­
age or younger. There is a significant correlation between
weight and SDB (e.g., habitual snoring, OSA, sleep-­related hypoventilation). Although adenotonsillar hypertrophy also plays an important
etiologic role in overweight/obese children with OSA, mechanical factors related to an increase in the amount of adipose tissue in the throat
(pharyngeal fat pads), neck (increased neck circumference), and chest
wall and abdomen can increase upper airway resistance, worsen gas
exchange, and increase the work of breathing, particularly in the supine
position and during REM sleep. A component of blunted central ventilatory drive in response to hypoxia/hypercapnia and hypoventilation
may occur as well (see Chapter 468.2), particularly in children with
morbid or syndrome-­based (e.g., Prader-­Willi) obesity. Overweight
and obese children and adolescents are at particularly high risk for

Chapter 31 u Sleep Medicine
metabolic and cardiovascular complications of SDB, such as insulin
resistance and systemic hypertension. Morbidly obese children are also
at increased risk for postoperative complications as well as residual
OSA after adenotonsillectomy.

Epidemiology

Overall prevalence of parent-­reported snoring in the pediatric population is approximately 8%; “always” snoring is reported in 1.5–6%, and
“often” snoring in 3–15%. When defined by parent-­reported symptoms,
the prevalence of OSA is 4–11%. The prevalence of pediatric OSA as
documented by overnight sleep studies using ventilatory monitoring procedures (e.g., in-­lab polysomnography, home studies) is 1–4%
overall, with a reported range of 0.1–13%. Prevalence is also affected
by the demographic characteristics such as age (increased prevalence
between 2 and 8 years), gender (more common in males, especially
after puberty), ethnicity (increased prevalence in African American
and Asian children), history of prematurity, and family history of OSA.

Pathogenesis

The upregulation of inflammatory pathways, as indicated by an
increase in peripheral markers of inflammation (e.g., C-­reactive protein, interleukins), appears to be linked to metabolic dysfunction (e.g.,
insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, alterations in neurohormone levels
such as leptin) in both obese and nonobese children with OSA. Systemic inflammation and arousal-­mediated increases in sympathetic
autonomic nervous system activity with altered vasomotor tone may
be key contributors to increased cardiovascular risk due to alterations
in vascular endothelium in both adults and children with OSA. Other
potential mechanisms that may mediate cardiovascular sequelae in
adults and children with OSA include elevated systemic blood pressure and ventricular dysfunction. Mechanical stress on the upper airway induced by chronic snoring may also result in both local mucosal
inflammation of adenotonsillar tissues and subsequent upregulation of
inflammatory molecules, most notably leukotrienes.
One of the primary mechanisms by which OSA is believed to exert
negative influences on cognitive function appears to involve repeated
episodic arousals from sleep leading to sleep fragmentation and sleepiness. Equally important, intermittent hypoxia may lead directly to
systemic inflammatory vascular changes in the brain. Levels of inflammatory markers such as C-­
reactive protein and interleukin-­
6 are
elevated in children with OSA and are also associated with cognitive
dysfunction.

Clinical Manifestations

The clinical manifestations of OSA may be divided into sleep-­related
and daytime symptoms. The most common nocturnal manifestations
of OSA in children and adolescents are loud, frequent, and disruptive
snoring; breathing pauses; choking or gasping arousals; restless sleep;
and nocturnal diaphoresis. Many children who snore do not have OSA,
but few children with OSA do not snore (caregivers may not be aware
of snoring in older children and adolescents). Children, like adults,
tend to have more frequent and more severe obstructive events in REM
sleep and when sleeping in the supine position. Children with OSA
may adopt unusual sleeping positions, keeping their necks hyperextended to maintain airway patency. Frequent arousals associated with
obstruction may result in nocturnal awakenings but are more likely to
cause fragmented sleep.
Daytime symptoms of OSA include mouth breathing and dry
mouth, chronic nasal congestion or rhinorrhea, hyponasal speech,
morning headaches, difficulty swallowing, and poor appetite. Children
with OSA may have secondary enuresis, postulated to result from the
disruption of the normal nocturnal pattern of atrial natriuretic peptide secretion by changes in intrathoracic pressure associated with
OSA. Partial arousal parasomnias (sleepwalking and sleep terrors) may
occur more frequently in children with OSA, related to the frequent
associated arousals and an increased percentage of SWS.
One of the most important but frequently overlooked sequelae of
OSA in children is the effect on mood, behavior, learning, and academic functioning. The neurobehavioral consequences of OSA in

207

children include daytime sleepiness with drowsiness, difficulty in
morning waking, and unplanned napping or dozing off during activities, although evidence of frank hypersomnolence tends to be less
common in children compared to adults with OSA (except in very
obese children or those with severe disease). Mood changes include
increased irritability, mood instability and emotional dysregulation,
low frustration tolerance, and depression or anxiety. Behavioral issues
include both “internalizing” (i.e., increased somatic complaints and
social withdrawal) and “externalizing” behaviors, including aggression,
impulsivity, hyperactivity, oppositional behavior, and conduct problems. There is substantial overlap between the clinical impairments
associated with OSA and the diagnostic criteria for ADHD, including
inattention, poor concentration, and distractibility (see Chapter 50).
Many of the studies that have looked at changes in behavior and
neuropsychologic functioning in children after treatment (usually adenotonsillectomy) for OSA have found significant improvement in outcomes, both short term and long term, including daytime sleepiness,
mood, behavior, academics, and quality of life. However, most studies
failed to find a dose-­dependent relationship between OSA in children
and specific neurobehavioral-­neurocognitive deficits, suggesting that
other factors may influence neurocognitive outcomes, including individual genetic susceptibility, racial/ethnic background, environmental
influences (e.g., passive smoking exposure), and comorbid conditions,
such as obesity, shortened sleep duration, and other sleep disorders.

Diagnosis

The 2012 revised American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice
guidelines provide excellent information for the evaluation and management of uncomplicated childhood OSA (Table 31.5). No physical
examination findings are truly pathognomonic for OSA, and most
healthy children with OSA appear normal; however, certain physical
examination findings may suggest OSA. Growth parameters may be
abnormal (obesity, or less frequently, failure to thrive), and there may
be evidence of chronic nasal obstruction (hyponasal speech, mouth
breathing, septal deviation) and signs of atopic disease (i.e., “allergic
shiners”). Oropharyngeal examination may reveal enlarged tonsils,
excess soft tissue in the posterior pharynx, and a narrowed posterior
pharyngeal space, as well as craniofacial features associated with an
increased risk of obstruction including “adenoidal facies” with open
mouth posture and long/asymmetric face, midface hypoplasia, retrognathia and micrognathia, forward head posture (best appreciated by
inspection of the frontal and lateral facial profile), and teeth crowding,
narrow arched palate, and tongue tie (short frenulum). In severe cases
the child may have evidence of pulmonary hypertension, right-­sided
heart failure, and cor pulmonale; systemic hypertension may occur,
especially in obese children.
Because no combination of clinical history and physical findings
can accurately predict which children with snoring have OSA, the gold
standard for diagnosing OSA remains an in-­lab overnight PSG. Overnight PSG is a technician-­supervised, monitored study that documents
physiologic variables during sleep; sleep staging, arousal measurement,
cardiovascular parameters, and body movements (electroencephalography [EEG], electrooculography, chin and leg electromyography
[EMG], electrocardiogram, body position sensors, and video recording), and a combination of breathing monitors (oronasal thermal sensor and nasal air pressure transducer for airflow), chest/abdominal
monitors (e.g., inductance plethysmography for respiratory effort,
pulse oximeter for O2 saturation, end-­tidal or transcutaneous CO2 for
CO2 retention, snore microphone). The PSG parameter most often used
in evaluating for sleep-­disordered breathing is the apnea-­hypopnea
index (AHI), which indicates the number of apneic and hypopneic
(both obstructive and central) events per hour of sleep. There are no
universally accepted PSG normal reference values or parameters for
diagnosing OSA in children, and it is still unclear which parameters
best predict morbidity. Normal preschool- and school-­age children
generally have a total AHI <1.5 (obstructive AHI <1), and this is the
most widely used cutoff value for OSA in children ≤12 years old; in
older adolescents the adult cutoff of an AHI ≥5 is generally used. When
AHI is between one and five obstructive events per hour, assessment of

Table 31.5  American Academy of Pediatrics Clinical Practice Guideline: Diagnosis and Management of Childhood
Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome
Key Action Statement 1: Screening for OSA
As part of routine health maintenance visits, clinicians should inquire whether the child or adolescent snores. If the answer is affirmative or if a
child or adolescent presents with signs or symptoms of OSA, clinicians should perform a more focused evaluation. (Evidence Quality: Grade B;
Recommendation Strength: Recommendation.)
Key Action Statement 2A: Polysomnography
If a child or adolescent snores on a regular basis and has any of the complaints or findings of OSA, clinicians should either (1) obtain a polysomnogram
(Evidence Quality: Grade A; Recommendation Strength: Recommendation) or (2) refer the patient to a sleep specialist or otolaryngologist for a
more extensive evaluation. (Evidence Quality: Grade D; Recommendation Strength: Option.)
Key Action Statement 2B: Alternative Testing
If polysomnography is not available, clinicians may order alternative diagnostic tests, such as nocturnal video recording, nocturnal oximetry,
daytime nap polysomnography, or ambulatory polysomnography. (Evidence Quality: Grade C; Recommendation Strength: Option.)
Key Action Statement 3: Adenotonsillectomy
If a child is determined to have OSA, has a clinical examination consistent with adenotonsillar hypertrophy, and does not have a contraindication
to surgery, the clinician should recommend adenotonsillectomy as the first line of treatment. If the child has OSA but does not have adenotonsillar
hypertrophy, other treatment should be considered (see Key Action Statement 6). Clinical judgment is required to determine the benefits of
adenotonsillectomy compared with other treatments in obese children with varying degrees of adenotonsillar hypertrophy. (Evidence Quality:
Grade B; Recommendation Strength: Recommendation.)
Key Action Statement 4: High-­Risk Patients Undergoing Adenotonsillectomy
Clinicians should monitor high-­risk patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy as inpatients postoperatively. (Evidence Quality: Grade B; Recommendation
Strength: Recommendation.)
Key Action Statement 5: Reevaluation
Clinicians should clinically reassess all patients with OSA for persisting signs and symptoms after therapy to determine whether further treatment
is required. (Evidence Quality: Grade B; Recommendation Strength: Recommendation.)
Key Action Statement 5B: Reevaluation of High-­Risk Patients
Clinicians should reevaluate high-­risk patients for persistent OSA after adenotonsillectomy, including those who had a significantly abnormal
baseline polysomnogram, have sequelae of OSA, are obese, or remain symptomatic after treatment, with an objective test (see Key Action
Statement 2), or refer such patients to a sleep specialist. (Evidence Quality: Grade B; Recommendation Strength: Recommendation.)
Key Action Statement 6: CPAP
Clinicians should refer patients for CPAP management if symptoms/signs or objective evidence of OSA persists after adenotonsillectomy or if
adenotonsillectomy is not performed. (Evidence Quality: Grade B; Recommendation Strength: Recommendation.)
Key Action Statement 7: Weight Loss
Clinicians should recommend weight loss in addition to other therapy if a child/adolescent with OSA is overweight or obese. (Evidence Quality:
Grade C; Recommendation Strength: Recommendation.)
Key Action Statement 8: Intranasal Corticosteroids
Clinicians may prescribe topical intranasal corticosteroids for children with mild OSA in whom adenotonsillectomy is contraindicated or for children
with mild postoperative OSA. (Evidence Quality: Grade B; Recommendation Strength: Option.)

additional PSG parameters (e.g., elevated CO2 indicating obstructive
hypoventilation, O2 desaturation, respiratory-­related arousals), clinical judgment regarding risk factors for SDB, presence and severity of
clinical symptoms, and evidence of daytime sequelae should determine
further management.

Treatment

No universally accepted guidelines exist regarding the indications for
treatment of pediatric SDB, including primary snoring and OSA. Recommendations largely emphasize weighing what is known about the
potential cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurocognitive sequelae of
SDB in children in combination with the individual healthcare professional’s clinical judgment. The decision of whether and how to treat
OSA specifically in children depends on several parameters, including
severity (nocturnal symptoms, daytime sequelae, sleep study results),
duration of disease, and individual patient variables such as age,
comorbid conditions, and underlying etiologic factors. In the case of
moderate (AHI 5-­10) to severe (AHI >10) disease, the decision to treat
is usually straightforward, and most pediatric sleep experts recommend that any child with AHI >5 should be treated. However, a large
randomized trial of early adenotonsillectomy vs watchful waiting with
supportive care demonstrated that 46% of the control group children
normalized on PSG (vs 79% of early adenotonsillectomy group) during
the 7 month observation period. In addition, it is worth emphasizing
that the child with habitual snoring (≥3×/week) but without polysomnographic evidence of OSA may also experience adverse neurobehavioral and neurocognitive outcomes; ongoing studies are examining

whether these children may benefit from more aggressive treatment
such as adenotonsillectomy.
In the majority of cases of pediatric OSA, adenotonsillectomy is the
first-­line treatment in any child with significant adenotonsillar hypertrophy, even in the presence of additional risk factors such as obesity.
Adenotonsillectomy (or adenotonsillotomy, which is considered a less
invasive procedure and may be indicated in some children) in uncomplicated cases generally (70–90% of children) results in complete resolution of symptoms; regrowth of adenoidal tissue after surgical removal
occurs in some cases. Groups considered at high risk include young
children (<3 years) as well as those with severe OSA documented by
PSG, significant clinical sequelae of OSA (e.g., failure to thrive), or
associated medical conditions, such as craniofacial syndromes, morbid
obesity, and hypotonia. All patients should be reevaluated postoperatively to determine whether additional evaluation, a repeat PSG, and
treatment are required. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends that in high-­risk groups (children with obesity, craniofacial
anomalies, Down syndrome, or moderate-­severe OSA) or in children
with continued symptoms of OSA, a follow-­up sleep study about 6
weeks after adenotonsillectomy is indicated. Also, a number of studies
have suggested that children who are underweight, normal weight, or
overweight/obese at baseline all tend to gain weight after adenotonsillectomy, and thus clinical vigilance is required during follow-­up.
It should be noted that in cases of residual OSA postadenotonsillectomy, additional diagnostic evaluation to identify other sites of
obstruction may be necessary to more specifically tailor treatment. An
example of this type of advanced diagnostic tool is drug-­induced sleep

Chapter 31 u Sleep Medicine
endoscopy (DISE), a powerful method for studying the airway in a
sleeping patient in real time. DISE provides direct visualization of the
spontaneously breathing airway under light anesthesia and facilitates
identification of obstructive lesions. Site of obstruction with potential
surgical corrections include lingual (resection) tonsils, tongue base
(reductions), turbinate (reduction), and supraglottoplasty.
Additional treatment measures that may be appropriate include
weight loss, positional therapy (attaching a firm object, such as a
tennis ball, to the back of a sleep garment to prevent the child from
sleeping in the supine position), and aggressive treatment of additional
risk factors when present, such as asthma, seasonal allergies, and gastroesophageal reflux. Evidence suggests that intranasal corticosteroids
and leukotriene inhibitors may be helpful in reducing upper airway
inflammation in mild OSA. Other surgical procedures (e.g., uvulopharyngopalatoplasty) and maxillofacial surgery (e.g., mandibular distraction osteogenesis) are seldom performed in children. Oral appliances,
such as mandibular advancing devices and palatal expanders, may be
considered in select cases, particularly in those children with craniofacial risk factors as mentioned earlier, and consultation with a pediatric
dentist or orthodontist is recommended. Neuromuscular reeducation
or repatterning of the oral and facial muscles with exercises to address
abnormal tongue position and low upper airway tone (i.e., myofunctional therapy) have been shown to be beneficial in addressing pediatric OSA as well as alleviating chewing and swallowing problems in
children able to cooperate with the behavioral program.
Continuous or bilevel positive airway pressure (CPAP or BiPAP)
is the most common treatment for OSA in adults and can be used successfully in children and adolescents. Positive airway pressure (PAP)
may be recommended if removing the adenoids and tonsils is not indicated, if there is residual disease following adenotonsillectomy, or if
there are major risk factors not amenable to surgery (obesity, hypotonia). PAP delivers humidified, warmed air through an interface (mask,
nasal pillows) that, under pressure, effectively “splints” the upper
airway open. Optimal pressure settings (that abolish or significantly
reduce obstructive respiratory events without increasing arousals or
central apneas) are determined in the sleep lab during a full-­night PAP
titration. Careful attention should be paid to education of the child and
family, and desensitization protocols should usually be implemented
to increase the likelihood of adherence. Efficacy studies at the current pressure and retitrations should be conducted periodically with

209

long-­term use (at least annually) or in association with significant
weight changes or resurgence of SDB symptoms. High-­flow nasal cannula therapy may be another approach. A novel treatment for OSA in
adults is hypoglossal nerve stimulation; case series suggest this may be
an effective treatment in selected pediatric cases, especially in children
with Down syndrome.

Parasomnias

Parasomnias are episodic nocturnal behaviors that often involve cognitive disorientation and autonomic and skeletal muscle disturbance.
Parasomnias may be further characterized as occurring primarily during non-­REM sleep (partial arousal parasomnias) or in association
with REM sleep, including nightmares, hypnogogic hallucinations, and
sleep paralysis; other common parasomnias include sleep-­talking and
hypnic jerks or “sleep starts.”

Etiology

Partial arousal parasomnias represent a dissociated sleep–wake state,
the neurobiology of which remains unclear, although genetic factors
and an intrinsic oscillation of subcortical-­cortical arousal with sleep
have been proposed. These episodic events, which include sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and confusional arousals, are more common in
preschool- and school-­age children because of the relatively higher
percentage of SWS in younger children. Partial arousal parasomnias
typically occur when SWS predominates, in the first third of the night.
In contrast, nightmares, which are much more common than partial
arousal parasomnias but are often confused with them, tend to be concentrated in the last third of the night, when REM sleep is most prominent. Any factor associated with an increase in the relative percentage
of SWS (certain medications, previous sleep restriction) may increase
the frequency of events in a predisposed child. There appears to be a
genetic predisposition for both sleepwalking and sleep terrors. Partial
arousal parasomnias may also be difficult to distinguish from nocturnal seizures. Table 31.6 summarizes similarities and differences among
these nocturnal arousal events.

Epidemiology

Many children sleepwalk on at least one occasion; the lifetime
prevalence by age 10 years is 13%. Sleepwalking (somnambulism) may persist into adulthood, with the prevalence in adults of

approximately 4%. The prevalence is approximately 10 times greater
in children with a family history of sleepwalking. The peak prevalence of sleep terrors (or night terrors) is 34% at age 1-­5 years,
decreasing to 10% by age 7; the age at onset is usually between 4
and 12 years. Because of the common genetic predisposition, the
likelihood of developing sleepwalking after age 5 is almost twofold
higher in children with a history of sleep terrors. Although sleep
terrors can occur at any age from infancy through adulthood, most
individuals outgrow sleep terrors by adolescence. Confusional
arousals may be accompanied by (and often precede in onset) episodes sleepwalking and sleep terrors; prevalence rates have been
estimated at >15% in children age 3-­13 years.

Clinical Manifestations

The partial arousal parasomnias have several features in common.
Because they typically occur at the transition out of “deep” sleep or
SWS, partial arousal parasomnias have clinical features of both the
awake (ambulation, vocalizations) and the sleeping (high arousal
threshold, unresponsiveness to environment) states, usually with
amnesia for the events. External (noise) or internal (obstruction)
factors may trigger events in some individuals. The duration is typically a few minutes (sleep terrors) up to 30-­40 minutes (confusional
arousals). Sleep terrors are sudden in onset and characteristically
involve a high degree of autonomic arousal (tachycardia, diaphoresis, dilated pupils). Confusional arousals typically arise more
gradually from sleep, may involve thrashing around, mumbling,
and other vocalizations, but usually not displacement from bed,
and are often accompanied by slow mentation, disorientation, and
confusion on forced arousal from SWS or on waking in the morning. Sleepwalking may be associated with safety concerns (e.g., falling out of windows, wandering outside). The child’s avoidance of,
or increased agitation with, comforting by parents or prolongation
of events by attempts at awakening are also common to all partial
arousal parasomnias.

Treatment

Management of partial arousal parasomnias involves some combination of parental education and reassurance, healthy sleep practices, and avoidance of exacerbating factors such as sleep restriction
and caffeine. Particularly in the case of sleepwalking, it is important
to institute safety precautions such as use of gates in doorways and
at the top of staircases, locking of outside doors and windows, and
installation of parent notification systems such as bedroom door
alarms. Scheduled awakening is a behavioral intervention that
involves having the parent wake the child 15-­30 minutes before the
time of night that the first parasomnia episode typically occurs and
is most likely to be successful in situations where partial arousal episodes occur on a nightly basis. Pharmacotherapy is rarely necessary
but may be indicated in cases of frequent or severe episodes despite
nonpharmacologic interventions and absence of treatable underlying sleep disorders exacerbating partial arousal parasomnias such
as OSA or periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), high risk
of injury, violent behavior, or serious disruption to the family. The
primary pharmacologic agents used are potent SWS suppressants,
primarily benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants.

Sleep-­Related Movement Disorders: Restless Legs
Syndrome/Periodic Limb Movement Disorder,
Restless Sleep Disorder, and Rhythmic Movement
Disorder

Although some of these sleep disorders share common features (e.g.,
movements of specific body parts such as extremities vs whole body
movements) and pathogenesis (e.g., iron deficiency), each has a distinctive set of diagnostic criteria, epidemiology and clinical management, and may differ in the degree of disruption to sleep quality and
quantity and related daytime consequences.
Although most of these sleep-­related movement disorders do not
require overnight polysomnographic evaluation for diagnosis (PLMD
is a notable exception), a videotaped episode by caregivers in the home

setting can prove very valuable in helping to differentiate sleep-­related
movements from nocturnal seizures. Such sleep-­related seizures usually arise from the frontal and/or temporal lobes. Ambulatory EEG,
in-­patient video-­EEG monitoring and overnight video PSG with chin
and leg EMG recording may be necessary to establish a diagnosis of a
sleep-­related movement disorder.

Restless Legs Syndrome/Periodic Limb Movement
Disorder

Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also termed Willis-­Ekbom disease, is
a primary disorder of the CNS sensorimotor network characterized
by an almost irresistible urge to move the legs, often accompanied by
uncomfortable sensations in the lower extremities. Both the urge to
move and the sensations are usually worse at rest and in the evening
and are at least partially relieved by movement, including walking,
stretching, and rubbing, but only if the motion continues. RLS is a
clinical diagnosis that is based on the presence of these key symptoms
(Table 31.7).
PLMD is characterized by periodic, repetitive, brief (0.5-­
10
seconds), and highly stereotyped limb jerks typically occurring at
20-­40 second intervals. These movements occur primarily during
sleep, usually occur in the legs, and frequently consist of rhythmic
extension of the big toe and dorsiflexion at the ankle. Although
there may be clinical complaints of kicking movements in sleep or
restless sleep, the diagnosis of periodic limb movements (PLMs)
requires overnight PSG to document the characteristic limb movements with anterior tibialis EMG leads. However, like adults, children also show considerable individual night-­to-­night variability
of PLMs, and a single-­night PSG may not always reflect the true
severity.

Etiology

RLS has a clear genetic component, with a sixfold to sevenfold
increase in prevalence in first-­degree relatives of RLS patients. The
mode of inheritance is complex, and several genetic loci have been
identified (MEIS1, BTBD9, MAP2K5). Low serum iron levels (even
without anemia) in both adults and children may be an important
etiologic factor for the presence and severity of both RLS symptoms
and PLMs. As a marker of decreased iron stores, serum ferritin levels
in both children and adults with RLS are frequently low (<50 μg/mL).
The postulated underlying mechanism is related to the role of iron as
a cofactor in tyrosine hydroxylation, a rate-­limiting step in dopamine

synthesis; in turn, dopaminergic dysfunction has been implicated,
particularly in the genesis of the sensory component of RLS, as well
as in PLMD. Certain medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus, end-­stage renal disease, cancer, idiopathic juvenile arthritis,
hypothyroidism, and pregnancy, may also be associated with RLS/
PLMD, as are specific medications (e.g., antidepressants, including
tricyclic antidepressants, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs), such as fluoxetine, first-­generation sedating antihistamines,
and dopamine receptor antagonists, such as Compazine and metoclopramide), as well as caffeine.

Epidemiology

Survey studies estimate the prevalence rates of RLS in the pediatric population as between 1 and 6%; approximately 2% of 8-­17 year
olds meet the criteria for “definite” RLS. Prevalence rates of PLMs >5
per hour in clinical populations of children referred for sleep studies range from 5–27%; in survey studies of PLM symptoms, rates are
8–12%. About 40% of adults with RLS have symptoms before age 20
years; 20% report symptoms before age 10. Familial cases usually
have a younger age of onset. Several studies in referral populations
have found that PLMs occur in as many as 25% of children diagnosed
with ADHD.

Clinical Manifestations

In addition to the urge to move the legs and the sensory component
(paresthesia-­like, tingling, burning, itching, crawling), most RLS
episodes are initiated or exacerbated by rest or inactivity, such as
lying in bed to fall asleep or riding in a car for prolonged periods.
Children may describe the sensory symptoms as a funny feeling,
tickling, hurting, or pain or bugs, spiders, ants, or goosebumps in
the legs. Sometimes, the child may draw pins, needles, tiny sand
particles, and bugs over his or her legs when asked to depict the
symptoms. An “informal” suggested clinical immobilization test
(SCIT) (i.e., “If I asked you to lie perfectly still sitting on your bed
at bedtime, would you be able to do it?”) can be helpful in eliciting RLS complaints. A unique feature of RLS is that the timing of
symptoms also appears to have a circadian component, in that they
often peak in the evening hours. Some children may complain of
“growing pains,” although this is considered a nonspecific feature.
Because RLS symptoms are usually worse in the evening, bedtime
struggles and difficulty falling asleep are two of the most common
presenting complaints. In contrast to patients with RLS, individuals
with PLMs are usually unaware of these movements, but children
may complain of morning muscle pain or fatigue; these movements
may result in arousals during sleep and consequent significant sleep
disruption. Parents of children with RLS/PLMD may report that
their child is a restless sleeper and kicks a bed partner.
The differential diagnosis includes growing pains, leg cramps, neuropathy, arthritis, myalgias, nerve compression (“leg fell asleep”), and
dopamine antagonist–associated akathisia.

Treatment

Because of the frequent co-­occurrence and overlap in underlying
pathophysiology and risk factors for RLS and PLMD, management
strategies for both disorders are similar. The clinical decision to treat
RLS and PLMs is based on the severity of symptoms, sleep disturbances, and effect on daytime functioning. An acronym that summarizes the management approach for RLS/PLMD in children is AIMS.
This includes the following:
u Avoidance of drugs/substances which may exacerbate RLS/PLMD
(including caffeine, nicotine, alcohol)
u Iron supplementation
u Muscles: increased physical activity, massage, application of heat/
cold, muscle relaxation and biofeedback
u Sleep: regular and adequate sleep
Treatment with iron supplementation is indicated if serum ferritin is <50 ng/mL. Administration of oral supplements for ferritin
levels >75-­100 μg/L, at least in adults, are likely ineffective because
of low absorption. It should be kept in mind that ferritin is an

acute-­phase reactant and thus may be falsely elevated (i.e., normal)
in the setting of a concomitant illness. In addition, the ferritin level
should be drawn, if possible, in the early morning after avoiding a
dinner with a high iron content (e.g., red meat) on the previous evening. A typical iron regimen is ferrous fumarate or sulfate as an oral
tablet or liquid: 3-­6 mg/kg of elemental iron/day × 3 months with
200 mg vitamin C on an empty stomach while avoiding calcium-­
containing foods that may slow absorption. Ferritin levels should be
repeated after 3 months to assess response and avoid iron overload.
If ferritin levels are very low or levels fail to improve after treatment
with iron, these children may require referral to hematology for evaluation of their iron deficiency (e.g., occult blood loss, malabsorption).
Although pediatric data regarding IV iron for RLS/PLMD are largely
lacking, there are studies examining the role of IV iron therapy (e.g.,
ferric carboxymaltose, iron dextran) in the treatment of severe iron
deficiency or with iron malabsorption in adults. Potential advantages
of IV therapy include rapid response and avoidance of malabsorption/
tolerance/compliance issues.
Treatment with pharmacologic agents may be indicated in children
with moderate-­severe RLS symptoms and PLMD, who did not respond
to the previously mentioned measures. Currently, there are no Food
and Drug Administration (FDA)-­approved pharmacologic agents for
RLS/PLMD in children. Dopaminergic medication is considered the
first line of treatment for RLS in adults. Other classes of medications
used to treat PLS/PLMD include α-­agonists, opiates, benzodiazepines,
and bupropion.

Restless Sleep Disorder

Restless sleep disorder (RSD) has both clinical and PSG features
distinct from RLS and PLMD. Clinical descriptors include a complaint of “restless sleep” typically reported by a parent, caregiver,
or bedpartner; the visible body movements, involving large muscle
groups of the whole body, all four limbs, arms, legs, or head during
sleep, may be characterized further as frequent repositioning disruption of the bedsheets, falling out of bed and being found in a
completely different position compared to the position in which
they fell asleep. Diagnostic criteria also include objective documentation on videography of increased levels of nocturnal activity and
gross body movements with a total movement index during sleep
that exceeds five per hour of sleep. RSD has also been found to be
associated with low serum iron levels with symptomatic improvement following iron supplementation.
Sleep-­related rhythmic movements, including head banging, body
rocking, and head rolling, are characterized by repetitive, stereotyped,
and rhythmic movements or behaviors that involve large muscle
groups. These behaviors typically occur with the transition to sleep at
bedtime, but also at nap times and after nighttime arousals. Children
are thought to engage in these behaviors as a means of soothing themselves to (or back to) sleep. These behaviors are very common, with
about two thirds of all infants having some type, typically beginning
before 12 months and usually disappearing by preschool age. In most
cases, rhythmic movement behaviors are benign, because sleep is not
significantly disrupted, and associated significant injury is rare; however, these behaviors can potentially affect the sleep of a family member
room-­sharing and/or caregivers in nearby sleeping spaces. In addition,
caregivers are often concerned about these behaviors as potentially
being harmful to the child or possibly indicative of an underlying neurologic or neurodevelopmental disorder (e.g., autism). However, these
behaviors typically occur in normally developing children and in the
majority of cases do not indicate some underlying neurologic or psychologic problem. Usually, the most important aspect in management
of sleep-­related rhythmic movements is reassurance to the family that
this behavior is normal, common, benign, and self-­limited. Safety may
be an important concern, and appropriate measures such as tightening of crib bolts and guardrails on the bed should be taken to prevent
injury; noise dampening measures such as moving the bed away from
adjoining walls may be helpful. If there are concerns about an associated sleep disorder, seizure disorder, or risk of injury referral to a sleep
specialist may be considered.

Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence: Narcolepsy
type 1, Narcolepsy type 2, Idiopathic Hypersomnia

Hypersomnia is a clinical term that is used to describe a group of disorders characterized by recurrent episodes of EDS, reduced baseline
alertness, and/or prolonged nighttime sleep periods that interfere with
normal daily functioning (Table 31.8). The many potential causes of
EDS can be broadly grouped as “extrinsic” (e.g., secondary to insufficient and/or fragmented sleep) or “intrinsic” (e.g., resulting from an
increased need for sleep).

Narcolepsy

Narcolepsy is a chronic, lifelong CNS disorder, typically presenting in
adolescence and early adulthood, characterized by profound daytime
sleepiness resulting in significant functional impairment. More than
half of patients with narcolepsy also present with cataplexy (type 1
narcolepsy), defined as the sudden, brief, partial, or complete loss
of skeletal muscle tone, typically triggered by strong emotion (e.g.,
laughter, surprise, anger), with retained consciousness. Other symptoms frequently associated with narcolepsy, including hypnogogic/
hypnopompic (immediately before falling asleep/awakening) visual,
auditory, or perceptual hallucinations, and sleep paralysis, may be
conceptualized as representing the “intrusion” of REM-­related phenomena (dream mentation, loss of motor tone) into the waking state.
Other REM-­related features include observance of eye movements
and twitches at sleep onset and vivid dreams. Somewhat paradoxically, increased sleep fragmentation is a common feature. Rapid
weight gain, especially near symptom onset, may be observed, and
young children with narcolepsy have been reported to develop precocious puberty.

Etiology

The genesis of narcolepsy with cataplexy (type 1) is thought to be
related to a specific deficit in the hypothalamic orexin/hypocretin neurotransmitter system involving the selective loss of cells that secrete
hypocretin/orexin in the lateral hypothalamus. Hypocretin neurons
stimulate a range of wake-­promoting neurons in the brainstem, hypothalamus, and cortex and basal forebrain that produce neurochemicals
to sustain the wake state and prevent lapses into sleep.
The development of narcolepsy may involve autoimmune mechanisms, possibly triggered by streptococcal, influenza virus, H1N1, and
other viral infections, likely in combination with a genetic predisposition
and environmental factors. A 12-­13–fold increase in narcolepsy type 1
cases, especially in children, was reported in parts of Europe in 2009–
2010 following immunization with the AS03 adjuvanted H1N1 influenza
vaccine. Human leukocyte antigen testing also shows a strong association with narcolepsy; the majority of individuals with this antigen (∼25%
of the general population) do not have narcolepsy, but most (>90%)
patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy are HLA-­DQB1*0602–positive.
Patients with narcolepsy without cataplexy (type 2) are increasingly
thought to have a significantly different underlying pathophysiology;
they are much less likely to be HLA-­DQB1*0602–positive (4–50%), and
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin levels are normal in most patients.
Although most cases of narcolepsy are considered idiopathic (autoimmune), secondary narcolepsy can be caused by lesions to the posterior hypothalamus induced by traumatic brain injury, tumor, stroke,
and neuroinflammatory processes such as poststreptococcal pediatric
autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS; see Chapter 229), as well as by neurogenetic
diseases such as Prader-­Willi syndrome (Chapter 99.7), Niemann-­
Pick type C (Chapter 106.4), myotonic dystrophy (Chapter 649.6),
Angelman syndrome, autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia-­deafness-­
narcolepsy (ADCA-­DN), Moebius syndrome, and Norrie disease.

Epidemiology

Narcolepsy is a rare disorder with a prevalence of approximately 1
in 2000 with equal sex distribution; however, specific countries (e.g.,
Japan) appear to have relatively higher prevalence rates. The risk of
developing narcolepsy with cataplexy in a first-­degree relative of a narcoleptic patient is estimated at 1–2%. This represents an increase of 10-­
40–fold compared to the general population, but the risk remains very
low, reinforcing the likely role for other etiologic factors.

Clinical Manifestations and Diagnosis

The typical onset of symptoms of narcolepsy is in adolescence and early
adulthood, although symptoms may initially present in school-­age and
even younger children. The early manifestations of narcolepsy are often
ignored, misinterpreted, or misdiagnosed as other medical, neurologic,
or psychiatric conditions, and the appropriate diagnosis is frequently
delayed for years. The onset may be abrupt or slowly progressive.

Chapter 31 u Sleep Medicine
The most prominent clinical manifestation of narcolepsy is profound daytime sleepiness, characterized by both an increased baseline
level of daytime drowsiness and the repeated occurrence of sudden and
unpredictable sleep episodes. These “sleep attacks” are often described
as “irresistible,” in that the child or adolescent is unable to stay awake
despite considerable effort and occur even in the context of normally
stimulating activities (e.g., during meals, in conversation). Very brief
(several seconds) sleep attacks may also occur in which the individual may “stare off,” appear unresponsive, or continue to engage in an
ongoing activity (automatic behavior). EDS may also be manifested by
increased nighttime sleep needs and extreme difficulty waking in the
morning or after a nap.
Cataplexy is considered virtually pathognomonic for narcolepsy but
can develop several years after the onset of EDS. Manifestations are triggered by strong positive (laughing, joy) or negative (fright, anger, frustration) emotions and predominantly include facial slackening, head
nodding, jaw dropping, and less often, knees buckling or complete collapse with falling to the ground. The cataplectic attacks are typically brief
(seconds to minutes), the patient is awake and aware, and episodes are
fully reversible, with complete recovery of normal tone when the episode ends. A form of cataplexy unique to children known as cataplectic facies is characterized by prolonged tongue protrusion, ptosis, slack
jaw, slurred speech, grimacing, and gait instability. Additionally, children
may have positive motor phenomenon similar to dyskinesias or motor
tics, with repetitive grimacing and tongue thrusting. The cataplectic
attacks are typically brief (seconds to minutes) but in children may last
for hours or days (status cataplecticus). The differential diagnosis of
cataplexy includes syncope, seizures, cataplexy-­like episodes in KCNA1
pathologic variants (ataxia-­myokymia syndrome), hyperekplexia, hypo
and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis syndromes, and pseudocataplexy.
Hypnogogic/hypnopompic hallucinations usually involve vivid
visual but also auditory and sometimes tactile sensory experiences
during transitions between sleep and wakefulness, either at sleep offset (hypnopompic) or sleep onset (hypnogogic). Sleep paralysis is the
inability to move or speak for a few seconds or minutes at sleep onset
or offset and often accompanies the hallucinations. Other symptoms
associated with narcolepsy include disrupted nocturnal sleep, impaired
cognition, inattention and ADHD-­like symptoms, and behavioral and
mood dysregulation.
Several pediatric screening questionnaires for EDS, including the
modified Epworth Sleepiness Scale, help to guide the need for further
evaluation in clinical practice when faced with the presenting complaint of daytime sleepiness. Physical examination should include a
detailed neurologic assessment. Overnight PSG and a multiple sleep
latency test (MSLT) are strongly recommended components in the
evaluation of a patient with profound unexplained daytime sleepiness
or suspected narcolepsy. The purpose of the overnight PSG is to evaluate for primary sleep disorders (e.g., OSA) that may cause EDS. The
MSLT involves a series of five opportunities to nap (20 min long), during which patients with narcolepsy demonstrate a pathologically shortened mean sleep-­onset latency (≤8 minutes, typically <5 minutes) as
well as at least two periods of REM sleep occurring immediately after
sleep onset. Alternatively, a diagnosis of type 1 narcolepsy can be made
by findings of low CSF hypocretin-­1 concentration (typically ≤110 pg/
mL) with a standardized assay.

Treatment

In general, the management of pediatric narcolepsy is best done in conjunction with a pediatric sleep specialist. An individualized narcolepsy
treatment plan usually involves education, good sleep hygiene, behavioral changes, and medication. Scheduled naps during the day are often
helpful. Wake-­promoting medications such as modafinil or armodafinil
may be prescribed to control the EDS, although these are not approved
for use in children by the U.S. FDA, and potential side effects include
rare reports of Stevens-­
Johnson syndrome and reduced efficacy of
hormone-­
based contraceptives. Psychostimulants are approved for
ADHD in children and can be used for EDS; side effects include appetite
suppression, mood lability, and cardiovascular effects. Antidepressants
(serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, venlafaxine)

213

may be used to reduce cataplexy. Sodium oxybate, which is approved
for use in children, is a unique drug that appears to have a positive
impact on daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and nocturnal sleep disruption;
reported side effects include dizziness, weight loss, enuresis, exacerbation of OSA, depression, and risk of respiratory depression, especially
when combined with CNS depressants, including alcohol. Pitolisant has
a novel mechanism as a histamine (H3) receptor agonist and has been
shown to improve cataplexy and EDS in adult patients with narcolepsy.
Preliminary results in children have been encouraging. Solriamfetol,
a norepinephrine-­dopamine reuptake inhibitor, is another alertness-­
enhancing drug recently approved in adults. The goal for the child
should be to allow the fullest possible return of normal functioning in
school, at home, and in social situations.

Idiopathic Hypersomnia

Idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) is a central sleep disorder, presenting
in adolescence and young adults, characterized by chronic and EDS,
but without cataplexy or REM sleep intrusions. Patients typically
present with prolonged nocturnal sleep duration and severe sleep
inertia, making it difficult to arouse from nocturnal sleep or daytime naps. Patients often report transient periods of confusion and
“sleep drunkenness” on awakening, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic
hallucinations. Unlike patients with narcolepsy, daytime naps tend to
be long (more than 1 hour) and unrefreshing. The prevalence in the
general population is not known because of challenges with diagnostic evaluation, but is estimated to be approximately 20-­50 cases per
million. The pathogenesis also is not well understood; however, some
cases were documented to be precipitated by viral illnesses, suggesting a possible autoimmune process. A diagnosis of IH requires daily
periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep for
at least 3 months, absence of cataplexy, and exclusion of other causes
including insufficient sleep. Diagnosis is made by PSG followed by an
MSLT showing mean sleep latency of <8 minutes and less than two
sleep-­onset REM periods (SOREMPs) on MSLT or no SOREMPs if
the REM sleep latency preceding PSG is 15 minutes or less. When
the mean sleep latency on the MSLT is >8 minutes, a 24-hour PSG or
2-week actigraphy to ensure a total 24-hour sleep time ≥660 minutes
is needed. Treatment is mostly derived from experience with medications to treat EDS in narcolepsy. Wakeful promoting medications
such as modafinil, armodafinil, methylphenidate, amphetamines, and
oxybate are treatment options. Behavior modifications such as scheduled naps are not generally helpful.
Kleine-­Levin syndrome (KLS) may mimic IH and manifests with
recurrent episodes of hypersomnia (Table 31.9). KLS may resolve overtime; some reports support the use of parenteral steroids during an
episode.

214 Part II u Growth, Development, and Behavior
Delayed Sleep–Wake Phase Disorder

Delayed sleep–wake phase disorder (DSWPD), a circadian rhythm
disorder, involves a significant, persistent, and intractable phase shift
in sleep–wake schedule (later sleep onset and wake time) that conflicts with the individual’s normal school, work, and lifestyle demands.
DSWPD may occur at any age but is most common in adolescents and
young adults.

Etiology

Individuals with DSPD may start out as “night owls”; that is, they
have an underlying biologic predisposition/circadian-­based “eveningness” chronotype that results in a propensity for staying up
relatively late at night and sleeping until late in the morning or early
afternoon, and in extreme cases, a complete “day-­night reversal.”
Although these patients struggle to get up in time for school or
work, they usually revert to their preferred sleep schedule on weekends, holidays, and summer vacations. The underlying pathophysiology of DSWPD is still unknown, although some theorize that it
involves an intrinsic abnormality in the circadian oscillators that
govern the timing of the sleep period.

Epidemiology

Studies indicate that the prevalence of DSWPD may be as high as
7–16% in adolescents and young adults.

Clinical Manifestations

The most common clinical presentation of DSWPD is sleep-­
initiation insomnia when the individual attempts to fall asleep
at a “socially acceptable” desired bedtime and experiences very
delayed sleep onset (often after 1-­2 am), accompanied by daytime
sleepiness. Patients may also report extreme difficulty arising in the
morning even for desired activities, with pronounced confusion on
waking (sleep inertia), and caregivers often complain of the need
for multiple reminders or even the complete failure to awaken the
adolescent in time to attend school. Sleep maintenance is generally not problematic, and no sleep-­onset insomnia is experienced if
bedtime coincides with the preferred sleep-­onset time. Patients may
also develop “secondary” psychophysiologic insomnia as a result of
spending prolonged time in bed attempting to fall asleep. School
tardiness and frequent absenteeism with a decline in academic
performance often occur, and there may be school-­related disciplinary action (i.e., suspension, truancy label) or a need to justify
home-­based schooling/tutoring that motivate families to seek help.
It is important to recognize that there may also be issues related
to family dynamics and comorbid anxiety, depression, or learning
disabilities that provide a motivation to avoid attending school and
perpetuate the sleep schedule problems, as well as reducing adherence to interventions.

Treatment

The treatment of DSWPD usually has three components, all directed
toward the goals of shifting the sleep–wake schedule to an earlier,
more desirable time and maintaining the new schedule. The initial
step involves shifting the sleep–wake schedule to the desired earlier
times, usually with gradual (i.e., in 15-­30 minute increments every
few days) alternating advancement of rise time in the morning and
bedtime in the evening. More significant phase delays (i.e., larger
difference between current sleep onset and desired bedtime) may
require chronotherapy, which involves delaying bedtime and wake
time by 2-­3 hours every 24 hours “forward around the clock” until
the target bedtime is reached. Because melatonin secretion is highly
sensitive to light, exposure to light in the morning (either natural light or a “light box,” which typically produces light at around
10,000 lux) and avoidance of evening light exposure (especially
from screens emitting predominantly blue light, such as computers
and laptops) are often beneficial. Exogenous oral melatonin supplementation may also be used; larger, mildly sedating doses (5 mg) are
typically given 30 minutes before bedtime, but some studies have

suggested that physiologic doses of oral melatonin (0.3-­0.5 mg)
administered in the afternoon or early evening (5-­7 hours before
the habitual sleep-­onset time or 2 hours before the desired bedtime)
may be more effective in advancing the sleep phase.

SLEEP HEALTH SUPERVISION

It is especially important for pediatricians to screen for and recognize sleep disorders in children and adolescents during routine
healthcare encounters. The well-­child visit is an opportunity to educate parents about normal sleep and to teach strategies to prevent
sleep problems from developing (primary prevention) or becoming
chronic, if problems already exist (secondary prevention). Developmentally appropriate screening for sleep disturbances should take
place in the context of every well-­child visit and should include a
range of potential sleep problems; Table 31.10 outlines a simple sleep
screening algorithm called the “BEARS.” Because parents may not
always be aware of sleep problems, especially in older children and
adolescents, it is also important to question the child directly about
sleep concerns. The recognition and evaluation of sleep problems in
children require both an understanding of the association between
sleep disturbances and daytime consequences (e.g., irritability, inattention, poor impulse control) knowledge of risk factors for the
wide variety of sleep disorders (e.g., obesity, positive family history,
medications), and familiarity with the developmentally appropriate
differential diagnoses of common presenting sleep complaints (difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, episodic nocturnal events).
An assessment of sleep patterns and possible sleep problems should
be part of the initial evaluation of every child presenting with
behavioral or academic problems, especially ADHD.
Effective preventive measures include educating parents of newborns
about normal sleep amounts and patterns. The ability to regulate sleep
begins to develop in the first 8-­12 weeks of life. Thus it is important to
recommend that parents put their 2-­4 month old infants to bed “drowsy
but awake” if they want to avoid dependence on parental presence at sleep
onset and foster the infant’s ability to self-­soothe. Other important sleep
issues include discussing the importance of regular bedtimes, bedtime
routines, and transitional objects for toddlers, and providing parents and
children with basic information about healthy sleep practices, recommended sleep amounts at different ages, and signs that a child is not getting sufficient sleep.
The cultural and family context within which sleep problems in
children occur should be considered. For example, bed-­sharing of
infants and parents is a common and accepted practice in many
racial/ethnic groups, and these families may not share the goal of
independent self-­soothing in young infants. Anticipatory guidance
needs to balance cultural awareness with the critical importance of
“safe sleep” conditions in sudden infant death syndrome prevention (i.e., sleeping in the supine position, avoidance of bed-­sharing
but encouragement of room-­sharing in the first year of life) (see
Chapter 423). On the other hand, the institution of cosleeping by
parents as an attempt to address a child’s underlying sleep problem
(so-­called reactive cosleeping), rather than as a conscious family
decision, is likely to yield only a temporary respite from the problem and may set the stage for more significant sleep issues.

EVALUATION OF PEDIATRIC SLEEP PROBLEMS

The clinical evaluation of a child presenting with a sleep problem
involves obtaining a careful medical history to assess for potential
medical causes of sleep disturbances, such as allergies, concomitant
medications, and acute or chronic pain conditions. A developmental
history is important because of the increased risk of sleep problems
in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. Assessment of the
child’s current level of functioning (school, home) is a key part of
evaluating possible mood, behavioral, and neurocognitive sequelae
of sleep problems. Current sleep patterns, including the usual sleep
duration and sleep–wake schedule, are often best assessed with a
sleep diary, in which a parent (or adolescent) records daily sleep
behaviors for an extended period (1-­2 weeks). A review of sleep
habits, such as bedtime routines, daily caffeine intake, and the

sleeping environment (e.g., temperature, noise level), may reveal
environmental factors that contribute to the sleep problems. Nocturnal symptoms that may be indicative of a medically based sleep
disorder, such as OSA (loud snoring, choking or gasping, sweating)
or PLMs (restless sleep, repetitive kicking movements), should be
elicited. Home video recording may be helpful in the evaluation of
potential parasomnia episodes and the assessment of snoring and

increased work of breathing in children with OSA. An overnight
sleep study (PSG) is not routinely warranted in the evaluation of
a child with sleep problems unless there are symptoms suggestive
of OSA or PLMs, unusual features of episodic nocturnal events, or
unexplained daytime sleepiness.

Behavioral and Psychiatric

Chapter 32

Psychosocial Assessment
and Psychiatric Diagnostic
Evaluation
Heather J. Walter
It is estimated that 20% of children living in the United States experience a mental illness in a given year; mental illness is more prevalent
than leukemia, diabetes, and AIDS combined. More money is spent
on mental disorders than on any other childhood illness, including
asthma, trauma, and infectious diseases. Although nearly one in five
youths suffers from a psychiatric disorder, 75–85% do not receive
specialty mental health services; rather most services are delivered in
nonspecialty sectors (primary care, schools, child welfare, juvenile justice), where mental health expertise may be limited. Untreated or inadequately treated psychiatric disorders persist over decades, become
increasingly intractable to treatment, impair adherence to medical
treatment regimens, and incur progressively greater social, educational, and economic consequences over time.

AIMS OF PSYCHOSOCIAL ASSESSMENT IN THE
PEDIATRIC SETTING

A psychosocial assessment in the pediatric setting should determine
whether there are signs and symptoms of cognitive, developmental,
emotional, behavioral, or social difficulties and characterize those signs
and symptoms sufficiently to determine their appropriate management.
The focus of the assessment varies with the nature of the presenting
problem and the clinical setting. Under emergency circumstances, the
focus may be limited to an assessment of “dangerousness to self or others” for the purpose of determining the safest level of care. In routine
circumstances (well-­child visits), the focus may be broader, involving a
screen for symptoms, distress, and functional impairment in the major
psychosocial domains. The challenge for the pediatric practitioner will
be to determine as accurately as possible whether the presenting signs
and symptoms are likely to meet criteria for a psychiatric disorder and
whether the severity and complexity of the disorder suggest referral to
a mental health specialist or management in the primary care setting.

PRESENTING PROBLEMS

Infants may come to clinical attention because of problems with eating
and/or sleep regulation, concerns about failure to gain weight, poor
social responsiveness, limited vocalization, apathy or disinterest, and
response to strangers that is excessively fearful or overly familiar. Psychiatric disorders most commonly diagnosed during this period are
rumination and reactive attachment disorders.
Toddlers are assessed for concerns about sleep problems, language delay, motor hyperactivity, extreme misbehavior, extreme
shyness, inflexible adherence to routines, difficulty separating from
parents, struggles over toilet training, dietary issues, and testing limits. Developmental delays and more subtle physiologic, sensory, and
motor processing problems can be presented as concerns. Problems
with “goodness of fit” between the child’s temperament and the parents’ expectations can create relationship difficulties that also require
assessment (see Chapter 19). Mental health disorders most commonly

diagnosed during this period are developmental delays, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and reactive attachment disorders.
Presenting problems in preschoolers include elimination difficulties, sibling jealousy, difficulty forming friendships, self-­destructive
impulsiveness, multiple fears, nightmares, refusal to follow directions,
rigidity, somatization, speech that is difficult to understand, and temper tantrums. Mental health disorders most commonly diagnosed in
this period are ASD, communication, oppositional, attention-­deficit/
hyperactivity (ADHD), anxiety (separation, selective mutism), reactive
attachment, and sleep disorders.
Older children are brought to clinical attention because of concerns
about angry or sad mood, bed-­wetting, overactivity, impulsiveness,
distractibility, learning problems, arguing, defiance, nightmares, school
refusal, bullying or being bullied, worries and fears, somatization, communication problems, tics, and withdrawal or isolation. Mental health
disorders most commonly diagnosed during this period are ADHD,
oppositional, anxiety (phobias), elimination, somatic symptom, specific learning, and tic disorders.
Adolescents are assessed for concerns about the family situation,
experimentation with sexuality and drugs, delinquency and gang
involvement, friendship patterns, issues of independence, identity
formation, self-­esteem, and morality. Mental health disorders most
often diagnosed during this period are anxiety (panic, social anxiety),
depressive, bipolar, psychotic, obsessive-­compulsive, impulse control,
conduct, substance-­related, and eating disorders.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE PSYCHOSOCIAL
INTERVIEW

Psychosocial interviewing in the context of a routine pediatric visit
requires adequate time and privacy. The purpose of this line of inquiry
should be explained to the child and parents (“to make sure things are
going OK at home, at school, and with friends”), along with the limits
of confidentiality. Thereafter, the first goal of the interview is to build
rapport with both the child and the parents (see Chapters 18 and 34 for
further discussion of strategies for engaging families).
With the parents, this rapport is grounded in respect for the parents’
knowledge of their child, their role as the central influence in their child’s
life, and their desire to make a better life for their child. Parents often feel
anxious or guilty because they believe that problems a child is experiencing
imply that their parenting skills are inadequate. Parents’ experiences of
their own childhood influence the meaning a parent places on a child’s
feelings and behavior. A good working alliance allows mutual discovery
of the past as it is active in the present and permits potential distortions
to be modified more readily. Developmentally appropriate overtures can
facilitate rapport with the child. Examples include playing peek-­a-­boo
with an infant, racing toy cars with a preschooler, commenting on sports
with a child who is wearing a baseball cap, and discussing music with a
teenager who is wearing a rock band T-­shirt.
After an overture with the child, it is helpful to begin with family-­
centered interviewing, in which the parent is invited to present any
psychosocial concerns (learning, feelings, behavior, peer relationships)
about the child. With adolescent patients, it is important to conduct a
separate interview to give the adolescent an opportunity to confirm or
refute the parent’s presentation and to present the problem from his or
her perspective. Following the family’s undirected presentation of the
primary problem, it is important to shift to direct questioning to clarify
the duration, frequency, and severity of symptoms, associated distress
or functional impairment, and the developmental and environmental
context in which the symptoms occur.
Because of the high degree of comorbidity of psychosocial problems in children, after eliciting the presenting problem, the pediatric
practitioner should then briefly screen for problems in all the major

developmentally appropriate categories of cognitive, developmental,
emotional, behavioral, and social disturbance, including problems
with mood, anxiety, attention, behavior, substance use, eating, elimination, social relatedness, language, and learning. This can be preceded
by a transition statement such as, “Now I’d like to ask about some other
issues that I discuss with all parents and kids. Have there been any
problems with attention, learning, behavior, sad mood…” etc.
A useful guide for this area of inquiry is provided by the 11 Action
Signs (Table 32.1), designed to give frontline clinicians the tools
needed to recognize early symptoms of mental disorders. Functional
impairment can be assessed by inquiring about symptoms and function
in the major life domains, including home and family, school, peers,
and community. These domains are included in the HEADSS (Home,
Education, Activities, Drugs, Sexuality, Suicide/Depression) Interview
Guide, often used in the screening of adolescents (Table 32.2).
The nature and severity of the presenting problem(s) can be further characterized through a standardized self-­, parent-­, or teacher-­
informant symptom rating scale; Table 32.3 lists selected scales in
the public domain. A rating scale is a type of measure that provides a
relatively rapid assessment of a specific construct with an easily derived
numerical score that is readily interpreted. The use of symptom rating
scales can ensure efficient, systematic coverage of relevant symptoms,
quantify symptom severity, and document a baseline against which
treatment effects can be measured. Functional impairment also can be
assessed with self-­and other-­reported rating scales.
Clinical experience and methodologic studies suggest that parents
and teachers are more likely than the child to report externalizing
problems (disruptive, impulsive, overactive, or antisocial behavior).
Children may be more likely to report anxious or depressive feelings, including suicidal thoughts and acts, of which the parents may
be unaware. Discrepancies across informants are common and can
shed light on whether the symptoms are pervasive or contextual.
Although concerns have been raised about children’s competence as
self-­reporters (because of limitations in linguistic skills, self-­reflection,
emotional awareness, ability to monitor behavior, thoughts, and feelings, tendency toward social desirability), children and adolescents can
both be reliable and valid self-­reporters.
Pediatric practitioners are encouraged to become familiar with the
psychometric characteristics and appropriate use of at least one general (broad-­band) psychosocial screening instrument, such as the
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)* or the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC)† to identify potential mental health problems. If
the clinical interview or broad-­band symptom rating scale suggests
difficulties in one or more specific symptom areas, the clinician can
follow with a psychometrically sound, corresponding narrow-­band

posttraumatic stress, eating) may be most appropriate for treatment in
specialty care.
The safety of the child in the context of the home and community is of paramount importance. The interview should sensitively
assess whether the child has been exposed to any frightening events,
including abuse, neglect, bullying, marital discord, or domestic or
community violence; whether the child shows any indication of
dangerousness to self or others or a severely altered mental status
(psychosis, intoxication, delirium, rage, hopelessness); or whether
the child (if age appropriate) has been involved in any risky behavior, including running away, staying out without permission, truancy, gang involvement, experimentation with substances, and
unprotected sexual encounters. The interview also should assess the
capacity of the parents to adequately provide for the child’s physical, emotional, and social needs or whether parental capacity has
been diminished by psychiatric disorder, family dysfunction, or the
sequelae of disadvantaged socioeconomic status. Any indications of
threats to the child’s safety should be immediately followed by thorough assessment and protective action.

DIAGNOSIS

There is variability in the level of confidence pediatric practitioners perceive in diagnosing mental health problems in children and
adolescents in accordance with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria. Pediatric practitioners who have
familiarity with psychiatric diagnostic criteria may feel confident
diagnosing certain disorders, particularly the more common neurodevelopmental, elimination, and eating disorders (ADHD, anxiety,
autism spectrum, tics, enuresis, encopresis, anorexia). The disorders about which some pediatric practitioners might have less diagnostic confidence include the disruptive/impulse control/conduct,

anxiety, depressive, bipolar, psychotic, obsessive-­
compulsive,
trauma-­related, somatic symptom, and substance-­related disorders.
Pediatric practitioners may prefer to use the “unspecified” diagnosis option in the context of diagnostic uncertainty until clarification
is achieved, often through consultation with or referral to a mental
health clinician.
While focusing on the specific psychiatric manifestations and
their appropriate treatment, the practitioner must also take into
consideration secondary etiologies (systemic illnesses, substance
and medication use [Tables 32.4 and 32.5]) producing psychiatric
symptoms. Disease-­specific therapy combined with psychopharmacology is often necessary when a systemic disorder is identified.

PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION

The objectives of the psychiatric diagnostic evaluation of the child and
adolescent, generally conducted by a behavioral health specialist, are to
determine whether psychopathology or developmental risk is present and if so, to establish an explanatory formulation and a differential diagnosis, and to determine whether treatment is indicated and,
if so, to develop a treatment plan and facilitate the parents’ and child’s
involvement in the plan. The aims of the diagnostic evaluation are to
clarify the reasons for the referral, to obtain an accurate accounting of
the child’s developmental functioning and the nature and extent of the
child’s psychosocial difficulties, functional impairment, and subjective
distress, and to identify potential individual, family, or environmental
factors that might account for, influence, or ameliorate these difficulties. The issues relevant to diagnosis and treatment planning can span
genetic, constitutional, and temperamental factors, individual psychodynamics, cognitive, language, and social skills, family patterns of
interaction and child-­rearing practices, and community, school, and
socioeconomic influences.

Chapter 32 u Psychosocial Assessment and Psychiatric Diagnostic Evaluation
The focus of the evaluation is developmental; it seeks to
describe the child’s functioning in various realms and to assess the
child’s adaptation in these areas relative to that expected for the
child’s age and phase of development. The developmental perspective extends beyond current difficulties to vulnerabilities that can
affect future development and as such are important targets for
preventive intervention. Vulnerabilities may include subthreshold
or subsyndromal difficulties that, especially when manifold, often
are accompanied by significant distress or impairment and as such
are important as potential harbingers of future problems.
Throughout the assessment, the clinician focuses on identifying a realistic balance of vulnerabilities and strengths in the child,
in the parents, and in the parent–child interactions. From this
strength-­based approach, over time a hopeful family narrative is
co-­constructed to frame the child’s current developmental progress
and predict the child’s ongoing progress within the scope of current
risk and protective factors.
As described earlier a psychiatric assessment conducted by a
pediatric primary care practitioner generally will be a brief psychosocial assessment focused on obtaining sufficient information
to triage the case to the appropriate level of care. A brief assessment can comprise both administration of a focused (narrow-­band)
symptom rating scale to assess symptom severity and a focused
clinical interview. The focused clinical interview can comprise four
dimensions: history (onset, duration, response to prior treatment,
family history), severity (as derived from the focused rating scale
and verbal query about the degree of distress and/or impairment
associated with the symptom[s]), complexity (brief review of psychiatric comorbidities and medical or social complexities), and
safety (ascertainment of imminent and substantial risk of harm).
With this information, the pediatrician can provisionally diagnose
the case and triage the case to primary care (for preventive intervention or treatment of mild to moderate presentations of common
disorders [e.g., ADHD, anxiety, depression]), or to specialty behavioral healthcare (for severe presentations of these disorders or for
other psychiatric disorders nearly always characterized by severity
and complexity).
In the specialty care setting, although the scope of the evaluation
will vary with the clinical setting (e.g., emergency room vs medical
floor vs psychiatric clinic), a comprehensive psychiatric diagnostic evaluation typically has 12 major components:
u Presenting problem(s) and the context in which they occur
u Review of psychiatric symptoms
u History of psychiatric treatment
u Medical history
u Developmental history
u Educational history
u Family history
u Mental status examination
u Biopsychosocial clinical formulation
u DSM, Fifth Edition (DSM-­5) diagnosis
u Risk assessment
u Treatment plan
For infants and young children, the presenting problem and historical information is derived from parents and other informants.
As children mature, they become increasingly important contributors to the information base, and they become the primary
source of information in later adolescence. Information relevant to
formulation and differential diagnosis is derived in multiple ways,
including directive and nondirective questioning, interactive play,
and observation of the child alone and together with the caregiver(s).
The explication of the presenting problem(s) includes information about onset, duration, frequency, setting, and severity of
symptoms, associated distress and/or functional impairment, and
predisposing, precipitating, perpetuating, and ameliorating contextual factors. The symptom review assesses potential comorbidity in
the major domains of child and adolescent psychopathology. The


221

history of psychiatric treatment includes gathering information
about prior emergency mental health assessments, psychiatric hospitalizations, day treatment, psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and
nontraditional treatments.
The medical history includes information about the source of
primary care, the frequency of health supervision, past and current
medical illnesses and treatments, and the youth and family’s history
of adherence to medical treatment. A systematic review of organ or
functional systems facilitates the identification of abnormalities that
require investigation or monitoring by the pediatric practitioner, as
well as the identification of cautionary factors related to the prescription of psychotropic medication. The developmental history includes
information about the circumstances of conception, pregnancy, or
adoption, pre-­, peri-­, or postnatal insults, attachment and temperament, cognitive, motor, linguistic, emotional, social, and moral development, health habits, sexuality, substance use (as age appropriate),
coping and defensive structure, future orientation, and perceived
strengths. The educational history includes schools attended, typical grades, attendance, behavior, classroom accommodations, special
education services, disciplinary actions, social relationships, extracurricular activities, and barriers to learning. The family history assesses
family composition, sociodemographic and neighborhood characteristics, domiciliary arrangements, parenting capacities, family function,
medical/psychiatric histories of family members, and cultural/religious
affiliations.
The mental status examination assesses appearance, relatedness,
cognition, communication, mood, affective expression, behavior,
memory, orientation, and perception.
The comprehensive psychiatric evaluation culminates in a biopsychosocial formulation, diagnosis, and risk assessment. The biopsychosocial formulation is derived from an assessment of vulnerabilities
and strengths in the biologic, psychologic, and social domains and
serves to identify targets for intervention and treatment. In the biologic domain, major vulnerabilities include a family history of psychiatric disorder as well as a personal history of pre-­, peri-­, or postnatal
insults, cognitive or linguistic impairments, chronic physical illness,
and a difficult temperament. In the psychologic domain, major vulnerabilities include failure to achieve developmental tasks, unresolved unconscious conflicts, and maladaptive coping and defensive
styles. In the social domain, major vulnerabilities include parental
incapacity, unskilled parenting, family dysfunction, social isolation,
inadequate school setting, absence of supportive community structures, and sociodemographic disadvantage. Major strengths include
cognitive and linguistic capability, physical health and vigor, stable,
moderate temperamental characteristics, and stable supportive parenting, family, peer, and community structures. The biopsychosocial
formulation can be organized to reflect predisposing, precipitating,
perpetuating, and protective (ameliorating) factors (the “4 Ps”) influencing the development of the observed psychopathology.
The diagnosis is made in accordance with the nomenclature in
DSM-­5. This nomenclature categorizes cross-­sectional phenomenology into discrete clinical syndromes and seeks to improve
diagnostic accuracy at the expense of theories of causation. By
DSM-­5 convention, if diagnostic criteria are met, the diagnosis is
given (except where hierarchical rules apply); consequently, psychiatric comorbidity is a common occurrence. The risk assessment
includes a careful assessment of risk status, including suicidality,
homicidality, assaultiveness, self-­injuriousness, acute mental status
changes, and involvement in risky behavior or situations.
The comprehensive psychiatric diagnostic evaluation culminates in a treatment plan that brings the broad array of targeted
interventions to the service of the child. Diagnoses drive the choice
of evidence-­
based psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacologic
treatments. The formulation drives the selection of interventions
targeted at biologic, psychologic, and social vulnerabilities and
strengths. Many of these treatments and interventions are described
in the succeeding chapters.

222 Part III u Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE DIAGNOSTIC
EVALUATION OF INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN

Evaluation of infants and young children with challenging behaviors
includes the domains of physiology, temperament, language and motor
development, affective behavior, social behavior, and communication.
Although much of the information in these domains will be derived from
parent report, much also can be gleaned from nonverbal behavior and
observation of the parent–child interaction. Observations should include
predominant affective tone of parent and child (positive, negative, apathetic), involvement in the situation (curiosity, disinterest), social responsiveness (mutuality of gaze, auditory responsiveness), and reactions to
transitions (including separation).
A screen for maternal depression* is critical at this stage, as is an assessment of the mother’s (or other caregiver’s) ability to respond rapidly on a
contingent basis to the child’s expressed needs, regulate the child’s rapid
shifts of emotion and behavior, and provide a stimulus shelter to prevent
the child from being overwhelmed.
Standardized screening instruments (Ages and Stages Questionnaires,
Brief Infant-­Toddler Social & Emotional Assessment, Early Childhood
Screening Assessment, Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Parents’ Evaluation of Developmental Status, and Survey of Well-­being of
Young Children) designed for this age-­group can be helpful in systematizing the evaluation. In addition, the Infant, Toddler and Preschool Mental
Status Exam (ITP-­MSE) is a reference tool that describes how traditional
categories of the mental status examination can be adapted to observations of young children. Additional categories, including sensory and state
regulation, have been added that reflect important areas of development
in young children.
Diagnostic systems that are more age appropriate than DSM-­5 have
been developed for infants and young children. These systems include
the Research Diagnostic Criteria–Preschool Age (RDC-­PA) and Zero
to Three Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood-­Revised (DC: 0-­3R). The
DC: 0-­3R includes a relationship classification that assesses the range
of interactional adaptation in each parent–child relationship and regulation disorders of sensory processing that identify a range of constitutionally and maturationally based sensory reactivity patterns, motor
patterns, and behavior patterns that together can dysregulate a child
internally and impact the child’s interactions with caregivers.

Chapter 33

Psychopharmacology
David R. DeMaso and Heather J. Walter
Psychopharmacology is the first-­line treatment for several child and
adolescent mental health disorders (e.g., attention-­deficit/hyperactivity [ADHD], schizophrenia spectrum, and bipolar disorders) and is
used adjunctively with psychosocial treatments for other disorders (or
comorbid conditions), including anxiety, depressive, autism spectrum,
trauma-­related, and obsessive-­compulsive disorders. Before prescribing
a psychotropic medication, primary care practitioners (PCPs) should
review full prescribing information for each medication (in package
inserts or at reliable websites such as the National Institutes of Health
DailyMed*) to obtain complete and up-­to-­date information about indications, contraindications, warnings, interactions, and precautions.
* https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/index.cfm.

It is helpful for PCPs to be guided by principles for effective use of
psychotropic medications in their medication assessment and management (Table 33.1). These principles involve a series of interconnected
steps, including conducting a focused behavioral health assessment,
establishing target symptom(s) and appropriate level of care, deciding
on a medication and a monitoring plan, obtaining treatment assent/
consent, and implementing treatment. In following this approach,
PCPs are well positioned to provide safe and effective first-­line psychopharmacology for common mental health conditions (e.g., ADHD,
anxiety, depression) with moderate symptom presentations. Severe/
complex presentations likely are better served through consultation
with and/or referral to a behavioral health specialist.
Questions remain about the quality of the evidence supporting the
use of many psychotropic medications in children and adolescents. In
general, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms are targets for
medication treatment when (1) there is no or insufficient response to
available evidence-­based psychosocial interventions, (2) the patient’s
symptoms are severe and the patient is experiencing significant distress
or functional impairment, and/or (3) the patient’s symptoms convey
significant risk of harm. Common target symptoms include agitation, aggression, anxiety, depression, mania, hyperactivity, inattention,
impulsivity, obsessions, compulsions, and psychosis (Table 33.2). All
these symptoms can be quantitatively measured with standardized rating scales to establish baseline symptom severity and facilitate “treating
to target.”

STIMULANTS AND OTHER ADHD MEDICATIONS

Stimulants are sympathomimetic drugs that act both in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripherally by enhancing dopaminergic and
noradrenergic transmission (Table 33.3). Strong evidence (approximate effect size 1.00, large) exists for the effectiveness of these medications for the treatment of ADHD (Chapter 50); stimulants also are
effective for the management of aggression. In some cases, stimulants
have been used as monotherapy for fatigue or malaise associated with
chronic physical illnesses.
No major differences in efficacy or tolerability have been found
between different classes of stimulants, and no consistent patient profile identifies those who will respond preferentially to one class over
another. The most common (generally dose-­dependent) side effects
of stimulants include headache, stomachache, appetite suppression,
weight loss, blood pressure (BP) and heart rate increases, and delayed
sleep onset. Less common side effects include irritability (more prominent in younger children), aggression, social withdrawal, and rarely,
hallucinations (visual or tactile).
Stimulants have been associated with elevations in mean BP (<5 mm
Hg) and pulse (<10 beats/min); a subset of individuals (5–10%) may
have greater increases. The rate of sudden death in pediatric patients
taking stimulants is comparable to children in the general population;
the hazard ratio for serious cardiovascular (CV) events is 0.75 (although
up to a twofold increase in risk could not be ruled out). Moreover, a
case series analysis of children with a CV incident and treatment with
methylphenidate demonstrated an increased risk of arrhythmia (incidence rate ratio, 1.61) that was highest in the presence of congenital
heart disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that stimulants should be avoided in the presence of structural
cardiac abnormalities (e.g., postoperative tetralogy of Fallot, coronary
artery abnormalities, subaortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) and patient symptoms (syncope, palpitations, arrhythmias) or
family history (e.g., unexplained sudden death) suggestive of CV disease. In these circumstances, cardiology consultation is recommended
before prescribing. Routine electrocardiograms (ECGs) are not recommended in the absence of cardiac risk factors.
The α-­adrenergic agents clonidine and guanfacine are presynaptic adrenergic agonists that appear to stimulate inhibitory presynaptic
autoreceptors in the CNS (see Table 33.3). The extended release formulations of both agents have FDA approval for ADHD. The extended-­
release formulation of guanfacine has strong evidence (approximate
effect size 0.80, large) for the monotherapy of ADHD. Extended-­
release guanfacine also has moderate evidence for effective treatment

Sedation, somnolence, headache, abdominal pain, hypotension, bradycardia, cardiac conduction abnormalities, dry mouth, depression,
and confusion are potential side effects of clonidine and guanfacine.
Abrupt withdrawal can result in rebound hypertension; overdose can
result in bradycardia and hypotension leading to hospitalization or
death.

Atomoxetine is a selective inhibitor of presynaptic norepinephrine
reuptake that increases dopamine and norepinephrine in the prefrontal
cortex (see Table 33.3). It is less effective for the treatment of ADHD
(approximate effect size 0.60, medium) than stimulants, but atomoxetine
has a longer duration of action (approximately 24 hours). Atomoxetine
can have an onset of action within 1-­2 weeks of starting treatment,
but there is an incrementally increasing response for up to 4-­6 weeks
or longer. Common side effects include nausea, headache, abdominal
pain, insomnia, somnolence, erectile dysfunction, irritability, fatigue,

decreased appetite, weight loss, and dizziness, along with nonclinical
increases in heart rate and BP. Potential serious neuropsychiatric reactions include psychosis, mania, panic attacks, aggressive behavior,
depression, seizures, and suicidal thinking. Atomoxetine carries an FDA
warning regarding the risk of suicidal thinking and the need to monitor
this closely. Atomoxetine also has been associated with rare hepatotoxicity and should be discontinued in patients with jaundice or laboratory
evidence of liver injury, and should not be restarted. Because of the risk
of sudden death, atomoxetine generally should be avoided in youth with
known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, heart
rhythm abnormalities, or other serious cardiac problems.
Viloxazine is a second selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor
that was approved for ADHD by the FDA in 2021. It has once daily dosing, reaches steady state by day 2, and has a similar side effect profile to
atomoxetine (including FDA warnings on suicidality and increases in
heart rate and blood pressure).

ANTIDEPRESSANTS

Antidepressant drugs act on presynaptic and postsynaptic receptors
affecting the release and reuptake of brain neurotransmitters, including
norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine (Table 33.4). There is moderate evidence for the effectiveness of antidepressant medications in
the treatment of anxiety and obsessive-­compulsive disorders (approximate effect size 0.70, medium) and weaker evidence for the treatment
of depressive disorders (approximate effect size 0.30, small). Suicidal
thoughts have been reported during treatment with all antidepressants.
The overall risk difference of suicidal thoughts/behaviors across randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of all antidepressants and all indications has been reported as 0.7%, corresponding to a number needed to
harm of 143. All antidepressants carry an FDA warning for suicidality;
careful monitoring is recommended during the initial stages of treatment and following dose adjustments.
The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine outperforms all other antidepressants (both SSRI and non-­SSRI) studied
and is the only SSRI separating from placebo in studies of depressed
preadolescents. Side effects to SSRIs generally manifest in the first few
weeks of treatment, and many will resolve with time. More common

side effects include nausea, irritability, insomnia, appetite changes,
weight loss/gain, headaches, dry mouth, dizziness, bruxism, diaphoresis, tremors, akathisia, and restlessness. A small proportion of youth
taking SSRIs, particularly younger children, develop behavioral activation (motor or mental restlessness, increased impulsivity, disinhibited behavior, talkativeness, insomnia) that can be confused with
mania, but the activation symptoms typically resolve when the dose
is decreased or the medication discontinued. Because the likelihood
of activation events has been associated with higher antidepressant
plasma levels, slow up-­titration and close monitoring (particularly in
younger children) is warranted and underscores the importance of
educating parents/guardians and patients in advance about this potential side effect.
Sexual side effects are common, including decreased libido, anorgasmia, and erectile dysfunction. There is an increased risk of bleeding,
especially when used with aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs).
SSRIs can be associated with abnormal heart rhythms, and citalopram causes dose-­dependent QT interval prolongation, contraindicating doses >40 mg/day. Patients with diabetes may experience
hypoglycemia during SSRI treatment and hyperglycemia on discontinuation. Discontinuation symptoms (e.g., dysphoric mood, irritability,
agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania) are common
with short-­acting SSRIs (sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram), leading
to a recommendation for divided doses if these medications are used at
higher doses and graduated reduction if discontinued.
Serotonin syndrome results from excessive agonism of the CNS and
peripheral nervous system serotonergic receptors and can be caused by
prescribing multiple serotonergic medications concomitantly (Chapter 94). Symptoms can arise within 24-­48 hours and are characterized
by mental status changes (confusion, agitation, anxiety), neuromuscular hyperactivity (tremors, clonus, hyperreflexia, muscle rigidity),
and autonomic hyperactivity (hypertension, tachycardia, arrhythmias,
tachypnea, diaphoresis, shivering, vomiting, diarrhea). Advanced
symptoms include fever, seizures, arrhythmias, and unconsciousness,
which can lead to fatalities. Treatment is hospital based and includes
discontinuation of all serotonergic agents and supportive care with continuous cardiac monitoring. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)
play a role in most cases of serotonin syndrome and should be avoided
in combination with any other serotonergic drug, including another
MAOI. Moreover, caution should be exercised when combining two or
more non-­MAOI serotonergic drugs, including antidepressants, opioids and other pain medications, stimulants, cough/cold/allergy medications, and other over-­the-­counter products. Caution entails starting
the second non-­MAOI serotonergic drug at a low dose, increasing the
dose slowly, and monitoring for symptoms, especially in the first 24-­48
hours after dosage changes. Adolescents should be informed that certain recreational drugs (e.g., dextromethorphan, “ecstasy”) are highly
serotonergic and can cause serious interactions with antidepressants.
The non-­SSRI antidepressants include duloxetine, venlafaxine,
bupropion, and mirtazapine (see Table 33.4). These medications all
lack rigorous evidence to support their effectiveness in children and
adolescents and as such should not be considered first-­line options.
Duloxetine and venlafaxine are serotonin-­norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Duloxetine has FDA approval for treatment
of generalized anxiety disorder in children and adolescents but typically is not as effective for anxiety as the SSRIs. Studies of duloxetine
for depression in youth have been negative. There is some evidence in
adults that duloxetine can be useful for fibromyalgia and chronic musculoskeletal pain, an effect that has also been observed in children and
adolescents. Common side effects of duloxetine include nausea, diarrhea, decreased weight, and dizziness. Increases in heart rate and BP
have been noted; BP should be monitored at each visit and with each
dosage change. In addition, there have been reports of hepatic failure,
sometimes fatal; duloxetine should be discontinued and not resumed
in patients who develop jaundice or other evidence of liver dysfunction. Duloxetine also has been associated with severe skin reactions
(erythema multiforme and Stevens-­Johnson syndrome).

ADHD, Attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder; FDA, U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Bupropion, a norepinephrine-­
dopamine reuptake inhibitor
(NDRI), appears to have an indirect mixed-­agonist effect on norepinephrine and dopamine transmission. No rigorous studies of bupropion for anxiety or depression have been conducted with children or
adolescents, although some evidence suggests that bupropion may be
effective for smoking cessation and ADHD in youth. Common side
effects include irritability, nausea, anorexia, headache, and insomnia.
Dose-­related seizures (0.1% risk at 300 mg/day and 0.4% risk at 400
mg/day) have occurred with bupropion, so it is contraindicated in
those with epilepsy, eating disorders, or at risk for seizures.
Venlafaxine has only negative trials for the treatment of depression
in children and adolescents but does have some favorable evidence for
the treatment of anxiety. Side effects are similar to SSRIs, including
hypertension, irritability, insomnia, headaches, anorexia, nervousness,
and dizziness, and dropout rates are high in clinical trials of venlafaxine. BP should be monitored at each visit and with each dosage change.
Discontinuation symptoms are more pronounced with venlafaxine
than the other non-­SSRI antidepressants. In addition, suicidal thinking
and agitation may be more common with venlafaxine than with other
antidepressants, requiring close monitoring. In light of the substantial
adverse effects, venlafaxine likely should be considered to be a third-­
line medication.
Mirtazapine is both a noradrenergic and a specific serotonergic
antidepressant. Mirtazapine has only negative trials for the treatment of depression in youth and has no rigorous evidence of effectiveness for any other child or adolescent psychiatric disorder.
Mirtazapine is associated with a risk for substantial weight gain and,
more rarely, hypotension, elevated liver enzymes, agranulocytosis,
and QT prolongation. Although its sedating properties have led to
its adjunctive use for insomnia in adults with depressive/anxiety
disorders, there is no evidence for use of mirtazapine in childhood
sleep disorders.

The tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have mixed mechanisms of
action; for example, clomipramine is primarily serotonergic, and imipramine is both noradrenergic and serotonergic. With the advent of the
SSRIs, the lack of efficacy studies, particularly in depression, and more
serious side effects, the use of TCAs in children and adolescents has
substantially declined. Clomipramine has been used in the treatment of
obsessive-­compulsive disorder (see Table 33.4). TCAs also have been
used for neuropathic pain. TCAs cause both blood pressure and heart
rate increases and are class I antiarrhythmics with quinidine-like properties that are potentially fatal in overdose. Anticholinergic symptoms
(e.g., dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation) are the most common
side effects.
Anxiolytic agents, including lorazepam, clonazepam, and hydroxyzine, have been effectively used for the short-­term relief of the symptoms of acute anxiety (see Table 33.4). They are less effective as chronic
(>4 months) anxiolytic medications, particularly when used as monotherapy. Chronic use carries a significant risk of physical and psychologic dependence.

ANTIPSYCHOTICS

Based on their mechanism of action, antipsychotic medications can
be divided into first-­generation (blocking dopamine D2 receptors) and
second-­
generation (mixed dopaminergic and serotonergic antagonists) agents (Table 33.5).
The second-­
generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have relatively
strong antagonistic interactions with 5-­HT2 receptors and perhaps
more variable activity at central adrenergic, cholinergic, and histaminic sites, which might account for the varying side effects, particularly metabolic, noted among these agents. The SGAs have moderate
evidence for the treatment of agitation in autism and for the treatment
of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and aggression. Haloperidol is a

high-­potency first-­generation antipsychotic that is most commonly
used in treatment of agitation and schizophrenia.
The antipsychotic agents have significant side effects, including
sedation, extrapyramidal symptoms, hyperprolactinemia, anticholinergic, seizures, orthostasis, CV effects, weight gain, hyperlipidemia, metabolic syndrome, glucose abnormalities, hematologic
effects (e.g., leukopenia, neutropenia), and elevated liver transaminases (Table 33.6). They have an FDA warning for increased risk
of diabetes. Youth appear to be more sensitive to sedation, extrapyramidal side effects (except akathisia), withdrawal dyskinesia,
prolactin abnormalities, weight gain, hepatotoxicity, and metabolic
abnormalities. The development of diabetes or tardive dyskinesia
appears less prevalent than in adults, although this may be a function of short follow-­up periods because these side effects may not
emerge until adulthood.
The management of adverse effects should be proactive with baseline assessment and ongoing monitoring (Table 33.7). Abnormal
movements (dystonia, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia) need periodic
assessment using a standardized instrument such as the Abnormal
Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). The need for antiparkinsonian
agents may be a consideration, particularly for patients at risk for
acute dystonia or who have a previous history of dystonic reactions.
CV effects include prolongation of the QTc interval, tachycardia,

orthostatic hypertension, and pericarditis. In patients with a personal or family history of cardiac abnormalities, including syncope,
palpitations, arrhythmias, or sudden unexplained death, a baseline
ECG with subsequent monitoring should be considered, along with
cardiology consultation before prescribing. Alternative pharmacology should be considered if the resting heart rate exceeds 130
beats/min, or the PR, QRS, and QTc exceed 200, 120, and 460 msec,
respectively.
The cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes metabolize the antipsychotics and as such necessitate that the PCP and psychiatrist are alert for
potential drug-­drug interactions that may impact the serum levels
of all patient medications. CYP3A4 is mainly relevant to lurasidone,
quetiapine, olanzapine, and haloperidol, whereas CYP2D6 predominately clears aripiprazole and risperidone. Asenapine is metabolized by
CYP1A2 as well as direct glucuronidation by UGT1A4. Because <10%
of paliperidone undergoes CYP first-­pass metabolism, there is a lower
likelihood of drug-­drug interactions.
Primary prevention strategies to manage weight and metabolic dysfunction include educating the youth and family about healthy lifestyle
behaviors and selecting an agent that has the lowest likelihood of
impacting metabolic status. Secondary strategies would include
intensifying healthy lifestyle instructions, consideration of switching agents, and a weight loss treatment program. Consideration

of weight management interventions and increased monitoring of
blood glucose and lipid levels should be implemented if weight gain
exceeds the 90th percentile of body mass index (BMI) for age, or
a change of 5 BMI units in youth who were obese at the initiation
of treatment. Tertiary strategies, where diabetes, hypertension, obesity, or another metabolic abnormality has occurred, require more
intensive weight reduction interventions, changing medication,
and consultation with a medical subspecialist. Metformin has been
found to be an effective treatment for antipsychotic-induced weight
gain in children with autism spectrum disorder. Extrapyramidal
adverse effects are generally dose- and titration rate–dependent and
may respond to dose or titration rate reductions. More disabling
effects may benefit from adjunctive treatment (e.g., anticholinergics,
antihistamines).
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare, potentially fatal
reaction that can occur during antipsychotic therapy (see Chapter
94). The syndrome generally manifests with fever, muscle rigidity,
autonomic instability, and delirium. It is associated with elevated
serum creatine phosphokinase levels, a metabolic acidosis, and high
end-­tidal CO2 excretion. It has been estimated to occur in 0.2–1%
of patients treated with dopamine-­blocking agents. Malnutrition

and dehydration in the context of an organic brain syndrome and
simultaneous treatment with lithium and antipsychotic agents (particularly haloperidol) can increase the risk. Mortality rates may be
as high as 20–30% as a result of dehydration, aspiration, kidney failure, and respiratory collapse. Differential diagnosis of neuroleptic
malignant syndrome includes infections, heat stroke, malignant
hyperthermia, lethal catatonia, agitated delirium, thyrotoxicosis, serotonin syndrome, drug withdrawal, and anticholinergic or
amphetamine, ecstasy, and salicylate toxicity.

MOOD STABILIZERS

Because of their limited evidence of effectiveness and concerns about
safety, mood-­stabilizing medications (see Table 33.5) have limited use
in the treatment of child and adolescent psychiatric disorders. For the
treatment of bipolar mania in adolescents, antipsychotics are considered first-­line therapy.
Of the mood stabilizers, lithium alone has rigorous support for
the treatment of bipolar mania. Lithium’s mechanism of action is
not well understood; proposed theories relate to neurotransmission,
endocrine effects, circadian rhythm, and cellular processes. Common side effects include polyuria and polydipsia, hypothyroidism,

hyperparathyroidism, weight gain, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, acne, and CNS symptoms (sedation, tremor, somnolence,
memory impairment). Periodic monitoring of lithium levels along
with thyroid and renal function is needed. Lithium serum levels of
0.8-­1.2 mEq/L are targeted for acute episodes, and levels of 0.6-­0.9
mEq/L are targeted for maintenance therapy. Acute overdose (level
>1.5 mEq/L) manifests with neurologic symptoms (e.g., tremor,
ataxia, nystagmus, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, slurred speech,
delirium, coma, seizures) and altered renal function. Toxicity is
enhanced when dehydrated or with drugs that affect renal function,
such as NSAIDs or angiotensin-­converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome has been reported in patients
concurrently taking antipsychotic drugs and lithium.

MEDICATION USE IN PHYSICAL ILLNESS

There are special considerations in the use of psychotropic medications
with physically ill children. Between 80% and 95% of most psychotropic
medications are protein bound; the exceptions are lithium (0%), methylphenidate (10–30%), and venlafaxine (25–30%). As a result, psychotropic levels may be directly affected because albumin binding is reduced
in many physical illnesses. Metabolism is primarily through the liver and
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, with excretion via the kidney. Therefore dosages
may need to be adjusted in children with hepatic or renal impairment.

Hepatic Disease

In general, it is necessary to use lower doses of medications for
patients with hepatic disease. Initial dosing of medications should

230 Part III u Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders
be reduced, and titration should proceed slowly. In acute hepatitis,
there is generally no need to modify dosing because metabolism is
only minimally altered. In chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, hepatocytes are destroyed, and doses may need to be modified.
In steady-­state situations, changes in protein binding can result
in elevated unbound medication, resulting in increased drug action
even in the presence of normal serum drug concentrations. Albumin and α1 glycoproteins produced in the liver may be reduced
with infectious and inflammatory hepatic disease, whereas surgery,
trauma, and cirrhosis may result in elevated protein levels. Because
it is often difficult to predict changes in protein binding, it is
important to maintain attention to the clinical effects of psychotropic medications and not rely exclusively on serum drug
concentrations.
Medications with high baseline rates of liver clearance (e.g., haloperidol, sertraline, venlafaxine) are significantly affected by hepatic disease. For drugs that have significant hepatic metabolism, intravenous
(IV) administration may be preferred because parenteral administration avoids first-­pass liver metabolic effects, and the dosing and action
of parenteral medications are similar to those in patients with normal
hepatic function.

Gastrointestinal Disease

GI disease primary affects drug absorption. Examples that impact
absorption include conditions affecting GI motility, surgical alterations
of the GI tract, short bowel syndrome, or celiac disease. Any condition
that diverts blood away from the GI tract (e.g., congestive heart failure,
shock) may also reduce absorption.
Psychotropic medications have the potential to cause GI side effects.
Medications with anticholinergic side effects can slow GI motility,
affecting absorption and causing constipation. SSRIs increase gastric
motility and can cause diarrhea. SSRIs can increase the risk of GI bleeding, especially when administered with NSAIDs. Extended-­release or
controlled-­release preparations of medications can reduce GI side
effects, particularly where gastric distress is related to rapid increases
in plasma drug concentrations. Using extended-­release medication
preparations may reduce these side effects.

Renal Disease

In general, initial dosages of medication should be reduced or dosing intervals lengthened in renal failure. The rule of two thirds is
that dosages should be reduced by one third of the normal dosage
for a patient with renal insufficiency. However, most psychotropic
medications, with the exceptions of lithium and gabapentin, do
not require significant dosing adjustments in kidney failure. It is
important to monitor serum concentrations in renal insufficiency,
particularly for medications with a narrow therapeutic index.
Cyclosporine can elevate serum lithium levels by decreasing lithium
excretion. Although TCAs have been largely supplanted by SSRIs,
patients with kidney failure and those on dialysis appear to be more
sensitive to their side effects, possibly because of the accumulation
of hydroxylated tricyclic metabolites.
Because most psychotropic medications are highly protein bound,
they are not significantly cleared by dialysis. Lithium is essentially
completely removed by dialysis, and the common practice is to administer lithium after dialysis. Patients on dialysis often have significant
fluid shifts and are at risk for dehydration, with neuroleptic malignant
syndrome more likely in these situations.

Cardiac Disease

Antipsychotics, TCAs, and citalopram (>40 mg/day) can lead to
prolongation of the QTc interval, with increased risk of ventricular
tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, particularly in patients with

structural heart disease. Patients with a baseline QTc interval of >440
msec should be particularly considered at risk. The normal QTc value
in children is 400 msec (±25-­30 msec). A QTc value that exceeds 2
standard deviations (SDs; >450-­460 msec) is considered too long
and may be associated with increased mortality. An increase in the
QTc from a baseline of >60 msec is also associated with increased
mortality.
There is increased risk of morbidity and mortality in patients
with preexisting cardiac conduction problems. Patients with Wolff-­
Parkinson-­White syndrome who have a short PR interval (<0.12
sec) and widened QRS interval associated with paroxysmal tachycardia are at high risk for life-­threatening ventricular tachycardia
that may be exacerbated by the use of antipsychotics, TCAs, and
citalopram.

Respiratory Disease

Anxiolytic agents can increase the risk of respiratory suppression in
patients with pulmonary disease. SSRIs are the first-­line medications
to consider in treating disabling anxiety. Possible airway compromise
caused by acute laryngospasm should be considered when dopamine-­
blocking antipsychotic agents are used.

Neurologic Disease

Psychotropic medications can be used safely with epilepsy following
consideration of potential interactions among the medication, the
seizure disorder, and the anticonvulsant. Any behavioral toxicity of
anticonvulsants used either alone or in combination should be considered before proceeding with psychotropic treatment. Simplification of
combination anticonvulsant therapy or a change to another agent can
result in a reduction of behavioral or emotional symptoms and obviate
the need for psychotropic intervention. Clomipramine and bupropion
possess significant seizure-­inducing properties and should be avoided
when the risk of seizures is present.

Principles for Psychotropic Prescribing in Primary
Care

In the context of a severe and prolonged shortage of child and
adolescent psychiatrists (CAPs), PCPs are increasingly managing
behavioral health conditions in primary care. The principles for
effective use of psychotropic medications outlined in the beginning of this chapter can be used by PCPs to guide their medication assessment and management (see Table 33.1). This approach
emphasizes baseline assessment with standardized symptom rating scales to identify target symptoms and their level of severity,
prioritizing FDA-­approved medications for the target symptom
and patient age range, adherence to recommendations regarding therapeutic dosage ranges, using a follow-­up symptom rating
scale assessment to monitor medication response, continuing the
medication trial for sufficient duration, and switching to an alternative FDA-­approved medication if the first medication trial is
ineffective.
PCPs can access support for psychotropic prescribing through the
development of collaborative relationships with CAPs who can provide timely consultation for questions/advice; interim management
until stable; and ongoing care for patients with severe, complex,
unsafe, or treatment-­
refractory conditions. Ideally, consultation
with a CAP should occur if one is considering using psychotropic
medications with very young children, multiple psychotropic medications, medication doses outside of therapeutic range, or non–
FDA-­approved medications.

Psychotherapy

PSYCHOTHERAPY

Psychotherapy is the first-­line treatment for many child and adolescent psychiatric disorders (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD],
depression, anxiety, behavior, substance-­
related) because for these
disorders, psychotherapy produces outcomes greater than or equal
to pharmacotherapy, with less risk of harm. Even with disorders (e.g.,
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]) for which medication is typically the first-­line treatment,
adjunctive psychotherapy can convey additional benefit.
Psychotherapy is moderately effective in reducing psychiatric symptomatology and achieving remission of illness. In a 2017 multilevel
meta-­analysis of almost 500 randomized trials over 5 decades, there
was a 63% probability that a youth receiving psychotherapy fared better than a youth in a control condition. Effects varied across multiple
moderators. The mean posttreatment and follow-­up effect sizes were
highest for anxiety, followed by behavior/conduct, ADHD, and depression, and lowest for multiple concurrent comorbidities. Effect sizes varied according to outcome measure informant, with youth and parents
generally reporting larger effects than teachers.
A variety of psychotherapeutic modalities have been developed, with
varying levels of effectiveness (Table 34.1). Differences between therapeutic approaches may be less pronounced in practice than in theory.
The quality of the therapist-­patient alliance is consistently one of the
most important predictors of treatment outcome. A positive working
relationship, expecting change to occur, facing problems assertively,
increasing mastery, and attributing change to the participation in the
therapy have all been associated with effective therapy, irrespective of
the specific psychotherapeutic modality.
All psychotherapy interventions involve a series of interconnected
steps, including performing an assessment, constructing working diagnoses and an explanatory formulation, deciding on treatment and a monitoring plan, obtaining treatment assent/consent, implementing treatment,
terminating treatment, and following for symptom recurrence. Psychotherapists ideally develop a treatment plan by combining evidence-­based
therapies with clinical judgment and patient/family preference to collaboratively arrive at a specific intervention plan for the individual patient.

Behavior Therapy

Behavior therapy is based on both classic (Pavlovian) and operant
(Skinnerian) conditioning. Both approaches address the antecedent
stimuli and consequent outcomes of problematic thoughts or behaviors. The treatment begins with a behavioral assessment along with a
functional analysis of the setting, immediately preceding events, and
real-­world outcomes of the behavior to identify the settings in which
the behavior occurs and/or the reason the child engages in the behavior.
Often the function of problematic behavior is to gain access to attention or a tangible item the child wants or to avoid a task or stressful
situation. The goal is to teach the child a more adaptive response using
tools such as positive and negative reinforcement; social and tangible
rewards; response cost/consequences; shaping, modeling, and prompting; systematic desensitization; and aversive conditioning.
Behavior therapy has shown particular effectiveness with oppositional behavior, obsessive-­compulsive, autism spectrum disorder, and
substance use disorders, and ADHD.

Cognitive-­Behavioral Therapy

Cognitive-­behavioral therapy (CBT) is based on social and cognitive
learning theories and extends behavior therapy to address the influence

231

of cognitive processes on behavior. CBT is a short-­term, problem-­and
goal-­oriented treatment centered on correcting problematic patterns in
thinking and behavior that lead to emotional difficulties and functional
impairments. The CBT therapist seeks to help the patient identify and
change cognitive distortions (e.g., learned helplessness, irrational
fears); identify and incrementally approach aversive situations; and
identify and practice distress-­
reducing behavior. Self-­monitoring
(daily thought records), self-­instruction (brief sentences asserting
thoughts that are comforting and adaptive), and self-­reinforcement
(rewarding oneself for adaptive behaviors) are key tools used to facilitate achievement of the CBT goals.
CBT has good-­
quality evidence for the treatment of anxiety,
obsessive-­compulsive disorder (OCD), behavior disorders, substance
abuse, and insomnia, and fair evidence for the treatment of depression. For many childhood psychiatric disorders, CBT alone provides
outcomes comparable to psychotropic medication alone, and the combination of both may convey additional benefit in symptom and harm
reduction. Modified versions of CBT have shown applicability to the
treatment of other disorders.

Trauma-­Focused Cognitive-­Behavioral Therapy

Trauma-­focused cognitive-­behavioral therapy (TF-­CBT) is designed to
process and master the psychologic, behavioral, and physiologic consequences of a specific traumatic experience. It involves a combination of education about the broad effects of trauma exposure; teaching
effective relaxation, affective modulation, and cognitive coping and
processing skills; creating a trauma narrative to foster understanding;
mastering trauma reminders; enhancing future safety and development; and teaching parents how to support youth with trauma exposure. TF-­CBT is considered the first-­line treatment for PTSD.

Dialectical Behavioral Therapy

Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) is a modality targeted at emotional and behavioral dysregulation by synthesizing or integrating the
seemingly opposite strategies of acceptance and change. Dialectic conflicts (wanting to die vs wanting to live) often exist in the same patient.
The four skills modules—mindfulness (the practice of being fully
aware and present in the moment), distress tolerance (how to tolerate emotional pain), interpersonal effectiveness (how to maintain
self-­respect and effective communication in relationships with others), and emotion regulation (how to manage complex emotions)—
are balanced in terms of acceptance and change. The treatment
targets, in order of priority within a given session, are life-­threatening
behaviors, such as suicidal and self-­injurious behaviors or communications; therapy-­interfering behaviors, such as coming late to sessions,
canceling appointments, and being uncollaborative in working toward
treatment goals; quality-­of-­life behaviors, including relationship and
occupational problems and financial crises; and skills acquisition to
help patients achieve their goals. DBT has good-­quality evidence for
self-­injurious thoughts and behaviors and has shown promise for the
treatment of bipolar disorder and other manifestations of emotional-­
behavioral dysregulation.

Interpersonal Psychotherapy

Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) focuses on resolving interpersonal
difficulties that lead to psychologic distress and maladaptive behaviors.
Patients are viewed as having strengths and vulnerabilities that determine the manner in which they cope with or respond to an interpersonal crisis (stressor). The main goals of IPT include expanding social
support, decreasing interpersonal stress, enhancing the processing of
emotions, and improving social functioning within significant relationships. The interpersonal inventory, a detailed review of the patient’s
significant relationships, both current and past, with their emotional
valence, leads to a formulation linking the interpersonal situations to
the emotional/behavior symptoms. Various techniques (linking emotions/behaviors to interpersonal events, communication and problem-­
solving training, perspective-­taking, role adaptation) are utilized to
resolve interpersonal difficulties. IPT is a well-­established treatment
for adolescent depression.

Psychodynamic Psychotherapy

At the core of psychodynamic psychotherapy lies a dynamic interaction between different dimensions of the mind, conscious and unconscious. This approach is based on the belief that much of one’s mental
activity occurs outside one’s awareness. The patient is often unaware of
internal conflicts because threatening or painful emotions, impulses,
and memories are repressed to avoid experiencing psychologic pain.
Behavior is then controlled by what the patient does not know about
himself or herself. Therapy objectives are to increase self-­understanding
and acceptance of painful conflicting feelings, and to develop realistic

relationships between self and others. A fundamental difference of this
modality is its nondirective approach to allow a patient’s characteristic patterns of thinking and behavior to emerge over time. The relationship between the patient and the therapist can play a key role in
identifying these patterns, as they are recapitulated in the therapeutic
environment. The therapist can then analyze and interpret the manifest
pattern so that self-­understanding and a corrective emotional experience can be fostered.
Psychodynamic psychotherapy has shown applicability for the
treatment of self-­injurious thoughts and behaviors as well as anxiety,

depression, and maladaptive aspects of personality. Brief, time-­limited
psychodynamic psychotherapy can be appropriate for youth who are in
acute situational distress. Long-­term therapy can be appropriate when
the biologic or social factors destabilizing the child’s adaptation and
development are chronic, or the psychologic difficulties are complex,
or if entrenched conflicts and developmental interferences are present.

Supportive Psychotherapy

Supportive psychotherapy aims to minimize levels of emotional distress
through the provision of individual and contextual support. The goal is
to reduce symptoms, and treatment is focused on the “here and now.”
The therapist is active and helpful in providing the patient with symptomatic relief by helping the patient to contain and manage anxiety,
sadness, and anger. The therapist provides support and encouragement
(“coaching”) to bolster a patient’s existing coping mechanisms, facilitates problem solving, and provides social and instrumental support
for ameliorating or lessening contextual precipitants. CBT-­informed
techniques are often combined with supportive psychotherapy. Probably the most common psychotherapy employed by therapists, supportive psychotherapy has shown comparable results to CBT in a number
of research studies, particularly those targeting depression.

Family Therapy

The core premise in family therapy is that dysfunctional family interaction patterns precipitate and/or perpetuate an individual’s emotional
or behavioral difficulties. Family dysfunction can take a variety of
forms, including enmeshment, disengagement, role-­reversal or confusion, and maladaptive communication patterns. Family therapy begins
with an assessment of the family system, including observing patterns
of interaction; assessing family beliefs and the meanings attached to
behaviors; defining social and cultural contexts; exploring the presenting problem in the context of individual and family development;
assessing the family’s style of dealing with problems; and identifying
family strengths and weaknesses.
Family therapy techniques are drawn from two major theoretical
models: structural and behavioral. Structural family therapy develops
structures believed to foster well-­functioning families, including clear
and flexible boundaries between individuals, well-­defined roles, and an
appropriate balance between closeness and independence. Behavioral
family therapy focuses on behavioral sequences that occur in daily life
and attempts to interrupt unhelpful behavioral patterns and strengthen
positive behavioral patterns through effective communication and
problem solving.
Family therapy has shown established applicability in anorexia nervosa, behavior problems, and substance use and may be a promising
treatment for depression and bipolar disorder.

Parenting Interventions

See Chapters 20 and 42 for more details.
Parenting interventions seek to improve both the parent–child relationship and parenting skills using the principles of behavior therapy
previously described. These interventions can be provided in individual
or group therapy formats. Core relationship recommendations include
spending quality time with the child to foster a strong parent–child
bond, increasing positive verbal interaction, showing physical affection, and engaging in child-­directed play. Core parenting skills include
increasing reinforcement of positive behaviors; decreasing reinforcement of negative behaviors; ignoring merely annoying behaviors;
applying logical consequences for dangerous/destructive behaviors;
and making parental responses predictable, contingent, and immediate. Parenting interventions have shown applicability for behavior disorders and ADHD.

Common Elements of Evidence-­Based
Psychotherapies

A major challenge for the practitioner is selecting the “right intervention” for the “right person” in the “right setting,” and delivering the
intervention in the “right way” (to meet the needs of patients and
families). This challenge has led to an interest in identifying common

233

practice elements across efficacious evidence-­based therapies that
could be “matched” in a flexible way to patients of a certain age, gender,
and race/ethnicity who have certain psychiatric disorders. Table 34.2
provides the major practice elements for three of the most common
child and adolescent psychiatric disorders: anxiety, depression, and
disruptive behaviors. These practice elements, when made available to
patients with psychiatric disorders in a system of care, are estimated
to be relevant to approximately two thirds of the patients. Six of the
practice elements—psychoeducation of the parent, problem-­solving
skills, relaxation skills, self-­monitoring, cognitive/coping skills, and
psychoeducation of the child—are applicable to all three disorders
and as such could be considered “core competencies” for both mental
health specialists as well as primary care practitioners (PCPs) interested in delivering brief psychotherapeutic interventions in the context of anticipatory guidance (see Discussion of Common Factors in
Chapter 18).
Psychoeducation is the education of the parent and child about the
cause, course, prognosis, and treatment of the disorder. Problem solving includes techniques, discussions, or activities designed to bring
about solutions to targeted problems, with the intention of imparting
skills for how to approach and solve future problems in a similar manner. Relaxation includes techniques designed to create and maintain
the physiologic relaxation response. Self-­monitoring is the repeated
measurement of a target emotional or behavioral metric by the child
or parent to establish goals for treatment and monitor progress toward
mastery. Cognitive/coping skills consist of techniques designed to alter
interpretations of events through examination of the child’s reported
thoughts, accompanied by exercises designed to test the validity of the
reported thoughts.

Modular Therapy Packages

Of considerable importance to day-­to-­day clinical work is the manner
in which common therapy practice elements are selected, sequenced,
repeated, or selectively applied. This coordination of psychotherapeutic elements is particularly relevant for patients presenting with
multiple concurrent psychiatric disorders whose primary concern may
shift between sessions. The Modular Approach to Therapy for Children
(MATCH) is a multi-­disorder intervention system that incorporates
treatment procedures (practice elements) and treatment logic (coordination) corresponding to efficacious interventions for childhood
anxiety, depression, traumatic stress, and behavior problems, with
modifications to allow the system to operate as a single protocol. Compared with standard manualized treatments for individual disorders
and with usual care, the modular package outperformed both comparators on multiple clinical and service outcome measures when assessed
over a 2-­year period, although additional, independently derived evidence is needed to determine the conditions under which it is most
effective and categorize this treatment approach as well established.

Treatment Engagement Interventions

Treatment engagement is conceptualized as a multidimensional
construct targeting cognitive, attendance, and adherence domains.
Research has identified several key factors addressing these domains
that are associated with treatment engagement: accessibility promotion, psychoeducation about services, appointment reminders, assessment of treatment barriers, patient assessment, setting of positive
expectations, modeling, homework assignments, rapport building,
cultural acknowledgement, and goal setting (Table 34.3). To promote
treatment engagement, the first 10 of these factors can be addressed by
the PCP and the medical home team as soon as a mental health problem is identified that would benefit from treatment (see Chapter 18 for
further discussion).

Psychotherapy in the Medical Home

Recognizing that up to one half of visits to PCPs involve a mental
health problem and that an estimated one fifth of pediatric patients
have a functionally impairing psychiatric disorder, in the context of
limited access to specialty mental health services in community or
hospital settings a number of models have been developed to deliver

psychotherapy in primary care. Two prominent models, both originally developed for adult populations, are collaborative care and primary care behavioral health.
Collaborative care, which spans a spectrum ranging from coordinated to co-­located to integrated, provides mental healthcare for
patients through a collaboration between mental health specialists
and PCPs. In integrated collaborative care, patients’ mental health
problems are managed in the medical home setting by an interdisciplinary care team of PCPs, mental health clinicians, and care
coordinators supported by a consulting psychiatrist. The PCP is
the “team captain”; the mental health clinician maintains a population registry, provides brief, focused psychosocial interventions,
and monitors treatment response; the care coordinator facilitates
external referrals; and the consulting psychiatrist provides input
regarding evidence-­
based psychiatric diagnosis and treatment.
The four critical elements of integrated collaborative care are that
it is team-­driven, population-­focused, measurement-­guided, and
evidence-­based. These elements guide a treatment approach in
which the patient perceives a seamless integration of medical and
mental healthcare.
In children and adolescents, randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
have shown that integrated collaborative care for child behavior problems, adolescent depression, and adolescent substance use is associated with more favorable treatment adherence, symptom reduction,

disorder remission, and consumer satisfaction outcomes than usual
care, with or without specialty referral. In a meta-­analysis of collaborative care RCTs, larger effects were observed for treatment trials targeting diagnoses and elevated symptoms relative to prevention trials and
for mental health diagnoses relative to substance-­related diagnosis, as
well as for integrated models relative to other types of collaborative
mental healthcare.
Primary care behavioral health employs a mental health clinician (psychologist, social worker, mental health counselor) in the
primary care setting to provide focused assessment of patients
with mental health, health behavior, and substance use problems,
and short-­term therapy as well as health/mental health promotion and prevention interventions. Mental health clinicians typically collaborate with PCPs to develop treatment plans, monitor
patient progress, and flexibly provide care to meet patients’ changing needs. The model uses a “wide net” approach aimed at serving
the entire primary care population, with emphasis on brief, focused
interventions.
The results of brief interventions, particularly applicable to the
fast-­paced medical home setting, are encouraging. Interventions
lasting only one session, particularly those utilizing CBT techniques,
can be effective for mild presentations of multiple child psychiatric
disorders, particularly anxiety and behavior problems in children
(vs adolescents). These interventions can greatly expand capacity to

David R. DeMaso

Medically unexplained physical symptoms are common in children
and adolescents. Although frequently chronic and disabling, these
symptoms do not often result in referrals for mental health assessment and treatment (see Chapter 212). The Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-­5) somatic symptom and related disorders (SSRDs) are those conditions in which
the physical symptoms are unexplained or for which the patient’s
response to the underlying medical condition is disproportionate and
debilitating.
The SSRDs include somatic symptom disorder (Table 35.1), conversion disorder (Table 35.2), factitious disorders (Table 35.3), illness
anxiety disorder (Table 35.4), and other specified/unspecified somatic
symptom disorders (Table 35.5), as well as psychologic factors affecting other medical conditions (Table 35.6). With the exception of illness
anxiety disorder (with high level of anxiety about health in the absence
of significant somatic symptoms) and psychologic factors affecting
other medical conditions (with psychologic and/or behavioral factors
adversely affect a pediatric condition), SSRDs are classified on the basis
of physical symptoms associated with clinically significant distress
and impairment, with or without the presence of a diagnosed medical
condition.
Most patients with SSRDs are seen by primary care practitioners or
by pediatric subspecialists, who may make specialty-­specific diagnoses
such as visceral hyperalgesia, chronic fatigue syndrome, psychogenic
syncope, or noncardiac chest pain. Even within psychiatry, SSRDs are
variously referred to as functional or psychosomatic disorders or as
medically unexplained symptoms. The nosologic heterogeneity across
the pediatric subspecialties contributes to the varying diagnostic
labels. There is a significant overlap in the symptoms and presentation
of patients with somatic symptoms who have received different diagnoses from different specialties. Moreover, SSRDs share similarities

in etiology, pathophysiology, neurobiology, psychologic mechanisms,
patient characteristics, and management and treatment response,
which is indicative of a single spectrum of somatic disorders.
It is helpful for all healthcare providers to avoid the dichotomy of
approaching illness using a medical model in which diseases are considered physically or psychologically based. In contrast, a developmental biopsychosocial continuum of disease better characterizes these
illnesses as occurring across a spectrum ranging from a predominantly
biologic to a predominantly psychosocial etiology. Indeed, there is a
neurobiologic component to the related functional neurologic disorders, especially related to pain symptoms (see Chapters 212 and 389).

SOMATIZATION

The term somatization is defined as a pattern of seeking medical help
for physical symptoms that cannot be fully explained by pathophysiologic mechanisms but are nevertheless attributed to physical disease by the sufferer. It has been described as the propensity to express

psychologic distress through somatic complaints. It is thought to occur
universally in young children (but occurs in every age group) who have
not yet developed the cognitive and a linguistic skill needed to comprehend and communicate their feelings.
Between 10% and 30% of children worldwide experience physical
symptoms that are seemingly unexplained by a physical illness, with
recurrent somatic complaints generally falling into cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, pain, and pseudoneurologic symptom clusters (Chapter
212). The prevalence of somatization is roughly equal among school-­
age males and females with a rise in adolescence, at which point somatic
complaints in females are five times greater than those in males. Youth
with a history of somatization are more likely to experience emotional/
behavioral difficulties, be absent from school, and perform poorly
academically. There are high rates of anxiety and depressive disorders
in youth with SSRDs. Youth with conversion disorder, specifically

nonepileptic seizures, have increased rates of comorbid psychopathology including internalizing disorders and posttraumatic stress disorders. Somatization is common in cultures that accept physical illness
but not psychologic symptoms as a reason for disability.

RISK FACTORS FOR SOMATIZATION

Genetic and biologic factors, stressful life events, personality traits and
coping styles, cognitive and learning difficulties, learned complaints,
family factors, and sociocultural background are potential risk factors
that have been associated with pediatric somatization.

Genetic and Biologic Factors

Somatization clusters in families with increased rates in first-­degree
relatives of patients with SSRDs. The concordance rates for somatization approximate 29% in monozygotic twin studies. Genetic factors
have been hypothesized to contribute to the development of personality traits that may predispose to somatization when combined with
environmental factors. Neuroimaging studies have found neuronal
areas (premotor and supplementary motor cortexes, the middle frontal
gyrus, the anterior cingulate cortex, the insula, and the posterior cingulate cortex) to differ between patients with SSRDs.

Stressful Life Events

Stressful life events, including childhood trauma, physical/sexual
abuse, bullying, and exposure to natural disasters have all been associated with somatization. Youth with SSRDs have shown high rates of
comorbid anxiety, suicidal histories, family psychiatric histories, bullying, learning difficulties, and significant life events.

Personality Traits and Coping Styles

Somatization has been postulated to occur in patients who are unable
to verbalize emotional distress and instead use physical symptoms
as a means of expression. Physical symptoms have been called a
form of body language for children who have difficulty expressing
emotions verbally. Examples include individuals who have difficulties with disclosing traumatic events and high-­achieving children
who cannot admit they are under too much pressure. Alexithymia
has been used to describe individuals with somatic concerns who
do not have a verbal vocabulary to describe their feelings. Somatic
complaints have also been linked to somatosensory amplification,
which is the tendency to experience normal somatic sensations
as “intense, noxious and disturbing.” When present, patients are
hypervigilant to their own bodily sensations, overreact to these sensations, and interpret them as indicating physical illness.

237

Cognitive and Learning Difficulties

Children with difficulties learning and using academic skills, particularly in the context of high parental expectations, are associated with
increased rates of somatization. Compared with unaffected siblings,
youth with “functional” neurologic disorders have been found to score
lower on tests of full-­scale IQ, vocabulary level, and mathematics as
well as to have more learning difficulties. Between 40% and 60% of
patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are reported to have
learning and subtle language problems.

Learned Complaints

In operant conditioning learning, attention and sympathy from others
and/or decrease in responsibilities (secondary gain) can reinforce somatic
complaints. If somatic symptoms are reinforced (i.e., increased parental
attention and/or avoidance of unpleasant school pressures) early in the
course of an SSRD the likelihood increases that the somatic complaints
will become more ingrained and less amenable to change. Social learning
theory suggests that somatic symptoms may be a result of “modeling” or
“observational learning” within the family. Family members with similar
physical complaints (symptom model) are commonly found in SSRDs.

Family Factors

In family systems theory, somatization can serve the function of drawing attention away from other areas of tension with a family. It has
been suggested that children in families with significant conflict may
develop somatic complaints as a mechanism to avoid any emotional
expression that may exacerbate family conflict.

Sociocultural Background

SSRDs have been reported to be more common in rural areas and
among individuals of lower socioeconomic status. Spells or visions are
common aspects of culturally sanctioned religious and healing rituals,
and falling down with loss or alteration in consciousness is a feature in
a variety of culture-­specific syndromes.

ASSESSMENT

The diagnosis of SSRD must be based on the presence of somatic
symptoms that are distressing and/or result in significant impairment
of daily life. These somatic symptoms must be accompanied by excessive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to these symptoms and/
or associated health concerns. SSRDs are not diagnoses of exclusion;
the mere absence of a medical explanation is insufficient to make the
diagnosis.
The assessment of suspected SSRDs should include an assessment
of biologic, psychologic, social, and developmental realms, both
separately and in relation to each other. A collaborative healthcare
approach between pediatric practitioners and mental health clinicians
is indicated to ensure that all realms are considered in the assessment
of medically unexplained physical symptoms (Table 35.7)

Medical Assessment

A comprehensive medical workup to rule out serious physical illness is
necessary, but must be carefully balanced with efforts to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful tests and procedures. Certain medical
conditions are notoriously overlooked and should be carefully considered as part of the diagnostic workup for problematic somatic symptoms (Table 35.8).
The presence of a medical condition does not exclude the possibility of
somatization playing an important role in the presentation. Somatic symptoms early in a disease course that can be directly attributed to a specific
physical illness (e.g., acute respiratory illness) may evolve into psychologically based symptoms, particularly in situations where the patient may
experience benefit from adopting the sick role. Symptoms may not follow known physiologic principles or anatomic patterns and may respond
to suggestion or placebo. Physical findings may occur secondary to the
effects of the SSRD, especially when chronic or severe (e.g., deconditioning, disuse atrophy from prolonged immobilization, nutritional deficiency,
gastroparesis and constipation from chronic poor oral intake).

Psychosocial Assessment

If somatization is suspected, a mental health consultation should be
included early in the diagnostic workup. This can be a difficult step for
many families given their belief that there is a medical cause for their
child’s problem. A common response is for the family to react adversely
and think that their child’s symptoms are not being taken seriously. It is
helpful for the pediatric practitioner to frame the consultation as a routine
part of the medical workup as well as an opportunity to assess the level of
stress connected with the current physical symptoms. The practitioner can
communicate that the mental health consultation will be used to gain a
more complete understanding of the origins of their child’s distress, what
perpetuates it, and which treatments are likely to be most effective.
The mental health assessment should include a careful assessment of
psychosocial stressors, comorbid depression or anxiety disorders, individual and family histories of somatization, the presence of a model
of illness behavior, and evidence of secondary gain resulting from the
symptoms. The assessment should provide the pediatric practitioner(s)
with a biopsychosocial explanation of the child’s symptoms (diagnosis
and formulation), which will inform the development of a comprehensive biopsychosocial management plan.

Differential Diagnoses

The primary differential diagnosis is between an SSRD and a physical
illness. Importantly, however, these disorders are not mutually exclusive and often coexist. Depressive and anxiety disorders frequently
include the presence of physical symptoms, which tend to remit with
treatment of the primary depressive or anxiety symptoms, and which
appear distinct from physical complaints seen in SSRDs. Distinguishing features of other physical complaint disorders are noted in Table
35.9. Chronic pain syndromes may be caused by fibromyalgia and
small fiber autonomic neuropathy and complex regional pain syndrome (see Chapter 211).

MANAGEMENT

Effective management of SSRDs begins with the development of a positive working relationship between the patient, family, pediatric practitioner, and mental health clinician based on a shared understanding
of the diagnosis, formulation, and a management plan that generally
incorporates a number of different treatment modalities.
The formulation of the problem is the crucial first step. Patients and
their families routinely present with the belief that their symptoms
are caused by a medical illness alone. This view needs to be reframed
from this narrow medical model view to a comprehensive biopsychosocial understanding. With the completion of medical and psychosocial assessments, a joint meeting of the pediatric practitioner(s) and

mental health clinician (as well as any involved pediatric specialists)
should be arranged to reach and ensure a consensus on the diagnosis
and treatment plan and facilitate adequate and consistent communication among all providers.
The next step is an “informing conference or meeting” that
includes both the managing pediatric practitioner and the family. It
is important in this meeting that this practitioner present the medical
and psychosocial findings together to the patient and the family in a
supportive and nonjudgmental manner. If patients and their families
believe that the practitioner understands and empathizes with the
degree of distress the somatic symptoms have produced, then they
are more likely to be active participants in treatment. Depending on
the comfort and expertise of the pediatric practitioner and the severity of the SSRD, the mental health clinician may or may not elect to
attend this meeting.
After complete medical investigations yield no unifying results,
labeling the symptoms as “psychiatric” may be problematic because it
can shift the search for the cause onto family functioning, resulting in
children and parents feeling blamed for the symptoms. The goal is to
avoid such labeling and instead help the family move toward an understanding of the mind-­body connection and to shift their approach from
searching for the cause of the symptoms to increasing child functioning.
Providing mind-­body examples, such as facial flushing when embarrassed, hand shaking when frightened, or phantom limb pain, will help
the patient and family understand how the brain may produce physical
symptoms.

Treatment

With child and family acceptance of a biopsychosocial understanding,
an integrated medical and psychosocial treatment approach focused on
the development and implementation a treatment plan to improve the
patient’s functioning, and not a continued search for a cause of the presenting symptoms, can be implemented. It is helpful to establish realistic goals that emphasize improvements in functioning rather than the
illusion that the symptoms can be completely removed. Those patients
with mild-­moderate presentations can be treated effectively in the primary or specialty pediatric care setting with appropriate mental health
follow-­up, whereas those with severe presentations and high complexity are better managed in the psychiatry specialty care setting.

Role of the Pediatric Practitioner

The pediatric practitioner serves an important role in providing ongoing
monitoring and treatment for possible physical illness in addition to the

recommended mental health interventions. Frequent, brief, and ongoing
pediatric visits can be scheduled as a means of helping avoid unnecessary medical investigations and procedures. This arrangement permits
the patient to receive attention from their pediatric practitioner without
having to develop somatic symptoms. Furthermore it may reassure the
family that the team is continuing to monitor for symptoms that would
require further evaluation and helps ensure that any further medical
evaluation is directed by a clinician knowledgeable about the previous
symptoms and evaluations. It is generally more helpful for the practitioner to attend to a patient’s anxiety in relation to their physical symptoms
rather than the symptoms themselves. This approach has been shown to
reduce overall healthcare utilization and to improve patient satisfaction.

Using Rehabilitation Approach

A rehabilitative approach acknowledges the reality of the symptoms,
emphasizes the necessary involvement of mind and body in the recovery
process, and shifts the focus from “cure” to “return to normal functioning” while allowing youth to “save face” through the promotion of physical recovery as the primary goal. A rehabilitative approach includes the
use of intensive physical and occupational therapy that emphasizes the
recovery of function. This approach can be combined with a behavioral
modification program, with incentives for improvements in functioning,
while removing secondary gain for illness behavior.
In severely disabled patients, it may be preferable to recommend
admission to an inpatient medical-­psychiatric treatment program that
specializes in SSRDs. Another useful option to consider is that of day
treatment or partial hospitalization programs. Multidisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation programs have much to offer these patients because
they are designed to support both physical and psychologic recovery.
Families are generally reassured that multidisciplinary staff can continue to monitor physical symptoms, thus ensuring that any missed
diagnoses will be recognized quickly.
Youth with a high level of impairment often miss a significant
amount of school. Communication with the school is often crucial
in coordinating a successful reintegration. In addition to discussions
with the school guidance counselor and/or nurse, a letter for the school
providing education and recommended approaches for the patient’s
symptoms can be beneficial. These interventions can be formalized by
having the school work with the family to develop either a 504 plan
for accommodations needed in regular education settings, or an individualized educational plan (IEP) if the child needs special education
services. Ongoing communication between the school and the pediatric practitioner for monitoring of further symptoms is recommended.

240 Part III u Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders
Psychotherapy and Psychopharmacology

Meta-­analyses have shown that psychologic treatments improve symptom load, disability, and school attendance in youth suffering from
various somatic symptoms including functional abdominal symptoms,
fatigue, tension-­type headache, and musculoskeletal pain. Cognitive-­
behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions modify symptom experience and restore central nervous system abnormalities associated with
functional impairment. CBT techniques (e.g., relaxation training,
biofeedback, hypnosis) can be used to teach patients the control they
can have over certain physiologic processes, such as autonomic system
activity. Cognitive restructuring is effective in addressing and altering
dysfunctional thoughts regarding symptoms and their implications for
functioning. Treatments that encourage active coping strategies and
emotional expression and modulation are helpful in reducing symptoms and improving functioning. Modifying parental response patterns that are overprotective and potentially reinforcing (e.g., allowing
the child to sleep late or to stay home from school in response to symptoms) help to decrease disability.
Psychopharmacologic treatment may be considered when psychiatric comorbidities are present, specifically, depressive and anxiety
disorders. A combination of pharmacotherapy, physical therapy, and
psychologic interventions in multicomponent management programs
has been shown to be effective.

Rumination and Pica
Chase B. Samsel, Heather J. Walter, and
David R. DeMaso

particularly when the regurgitation is associated with restricted food
intake (which may be designed to avoid regurgitation in front of others). They may attempt to hide the regurgitation behavior or avoid
eating among others.

EPIDEMIOLOGY

Originally thought of as a disorder predominantly seen in infants
and those with intellectual disability, rumination disorder has also
been recognized in healthy individuals across the life span and can
be overlooked in adolescents. In otherwise healthy children, rumination disorder typically appears in the first year of life, generally
between ages 3 and 12 months. The disorder can have an episodic
course or can occur continuously until treatment is initiated. In
infants the disorder frequently remits spontaneously but can be
protracted with problematic and even life-­threatening malnutrition. Additional complications related to the secondary effects of
malnutrition include growth delay and negative effects on development and learning potential.

ETIOLOGY AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

Risk factors for rumination disorder in infants and young children
include a disturbed relationship with primary caregivers, lack of
an appropriately stimulating environment, neglect, stressful life
situations, learned behavior reinforced by pleasurable sensations,
distraction from negative emotions, and inadvertent reinforcement (attention) from primary caregivers. Risk factors for rumination disorder in adolescents include similar early childhood factors
along with female gender and comorbid anxiety and depression. The
differential diagnosis includes congenital gastrointestinal system
anomalies, pyloric stenosis, Sandifer syndrome, gastroparesis, hiatal
hernia, increased intracranial pressure, diencephalic tumors, adrenal
insufficiency, and inborn errors of metabolism. Older children and
adults with anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa may also engage in
regurgitation because of concerns about weight gain. The diagnosis of
rumination disorder is appropriate only when the severity of the disturbance exceeds that routinely associated with a concurrent physical
illness or mental disorder.

TREATMENT

36.1 Rumination Disorder
Chase B. Samsel, Heather J. Walter, and
David R. DeMaso
Rumination disorder is the repeated regurgitation of food, in which
the regurgitated food may be rechewed, reswallowed, or spit out,
for a period of at least 1 month following a period of normal functioning. Regurgitation is typically frequent and daily; it does not
occur during sleep. It is not caused by an associated gastrointestinal
illness or other medical conditions (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux,
pyloric stenosis). It does not occur exclusively during the course of
anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-­eating disorder, or avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. If the symptoms occur in the
context of an intellectual or other neurodevelopmental disorder, the
symptoms must be sufficiently severe to warrant additional clinical
attention.
Weight loss and failure to make expected weight are common features in infants with rumination disorder. Infants may display a characteristic position of straining and arching the back with the head
held back while making sucking movements with their tongue. In
infants and older individuals with intellectual disability, the rumination behavior may appear to have a self-­soothing or self-­stimulating
function. Malnutrition may occur in older children and adults,

The first step in treatment begins with a behavioral analysis to determine whether the disorder serves a self-­stimulation purpose and/or is
socially motivated. The behavior may begin as self-­stimulation, but it
subsequently becomes reinforced and maintained by the social attention given to the behavior. The central focus of behavioral treatment
is to reinforce correct eating behavior while minimizing attention to
rumination. Diaphragmatic breathing and postprandial gum chewing,
when used as a competing response, have been shown to be helpful.
Aversive conditioning techniques (e.g., withdrawal of positive attention, introducing bitter/sour flavors when regurgitating) are considered when a child’s health is jeopardized but can be more reasonable
and useful in adolescents. Additional techniques shown to be useful in
adolescents include reswallowing all regurgitation, use of paradoxical
intention, and guided progressive food trials.
Successful behavioral treatment requires the child’s primary
caregivers to be involved in the intervention. The caretakers need
education and counseling on responding adaptively to the child’s
behavior as well as altering any maladaptive responses. No current
evidence supports a psychopharmacologic intervention for rumination disorder. In more severe or intractable cases (e.g., severe dehydration, malnutrition), an intensive integrated medical-­behavioral
treatment program on a medical or medical-­psychiatric unit may
be necessary.

Chapter 37 u Motor Disorders and Habits

36.2 Pica
Chase B. Samsel, Heather J. Walter, and
David R. DeMaso
Pica involves the persistent eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances (e.g., paper, soap, plaster, charcoal, clay, wool, ashes, paint,
earth) over a period of at least 1 month. The eating behavior is inappropriate to the developmental level (e.g., the normal mouthing and
tasting of objects in infants and toddlers), and therefore a minimum
age of 2 years is suggested. The eating behavior is not part of a culturally supported or socially normative practice. A diagnosis of pica
may be assigned in the presence of any other feeding and eating
disorder.

EPIDEMIOLOGY

Pica can occur throughout life but occurs most frequently in childhood. It is more common in those with intellectual disability and
autism spectrum disorders, and to a lesser degree in obsessive-­
compulsive and schizophrenic disorders. The prevalence of pica is
unclear, although it appears to increase with the severity of an intellectual disability. It usually remits in childhood but can continue
into adolescence and adulthood. Geophagia (eating earth) is associated with pregnancy and is not seen as abnormal in some cultures
(e.g., rural or preindustrial societies in parts of Africa and India).
Children with pica are at increased risk for lead poisoning, iron-­
deficiency anemia, mechanical bowel problems, intestinal obstruction, intestinal perforations, dental injury, and parasitic infections.
Pica can be fatal based on substances ingested.

Motor Disorders and
Habits
Jung Won Kim, Heather J. Walter, and
David R. DeMaso
Motor disorders are interrelated sets of psychiatric symptoms characterized by abnormal motor movements and associated phenomena. In
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition
(DSM-­5), they include tic, stereotypic movement, and developmental
coordination disorders. Tic disorders (Tourette, persistent motor or
vocal tic, provisional tic, other specified/unspecified tic) and stereotypic movement disorders (SMDs) are addressed in this chapter. Habits present as repetitive and often problematic motor behaviors (e.g.,
thumb sucking, nail biting, teeth grinding). When the problems cause
significant distress or impairment they are discussed as body-­focused
repetitive behavior disorder in the Obsessive Compulsive and Related
Disorders section of DSM-­5.

37.1 Tic Disorders
Jung Won Kim, Heather J. Walter, and
David R. DeMaso

TREATMENT

Tourette disorder (TD), persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder (PTD), and provisional tic disorders are characterized by involuntary, rapid, repetitive, and single or multiple motor and/or vocal/
phonic tics that wax and wane in frequency but have persisted for
>1 year since the first tic onset (<1 year for provisional tic disorder)
(Table 37.1). PTD is differentiated from TD in that PTD is limited to
either motor or vocal tics (not both), whereas TD has both motor and
vocal tics at some point in the illness (although not necessarily concurrently). The tic disorders are hierarchical in order (i.e., TD followed by
PTD followed by provisional tic disorder), such that once a tic disorder
at one level of the hierarchy is diagnosed, a lower-­hierarchy diagnosis
cannot be made. Other specified/unspecified tic disorders are presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a tic disorder that cause
significant distress or impairment predominate but do not meet the full
criteria for a tic or other neurodevelopmental disorder.

Tics are sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movements or
vocalizations. Simple motor tics (e.g., eye blinking, neck jerking, shoulder shrugging, extension of the extremities) are fast, brief movements
involving one or a few muscle groups. Complex motor tics involve
sequentially and/or simultaneously produced, relatively coordinated
movements that can seem purposeful (e.g., brushing back one’s hair
bangs, tapping the foot, imitating someone else’s movement [echopraxia], or making a sexual or obscene gesture [copropraxia]). Simple
vocal tics (e.g., throat clearing, sniffing, coughing) are solitary, meaningless sounds and noises. Complex vocal tics involve recognizable
word or utterances (e.g., partial words [syllables], words out of context,
obscenities or slurs [coprolalia], repeating one’s own sounds or words
[palilalia], or repeating the last heard word or phrase [echolalia]).

ETIOLOGY AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

Numerous etiologies have been proposed but not proved, ranging
from psychosocial causes to physical ones. They include nutritional
deficiencies (e.g., iron, zinc, calcium), low socioeconomic factors
(e.g., lead paint exposure), child abuse and neglect, family disorganization (e.g., poor supervision), mental disorder, learned behavior,
underlying (but undetermined) biochemical disorder, and cultural
and familial factors. The differential diagnosis includes anorexia
nervosa, factitious disorder, and nonsuicidal self-­injury. A separate diagnosis of pica should be made only if the eating behavior
is sufficiently severe enough to warrant additional clinical
attention.

Combined behavioral, social, and medical approaches are generally indicated for pica. Assessment for neglect and family supervision combined with psychiatric assessment for concurrent mental
disorders and developmental delay are important in developing an
effective intervention strategy for pica. Behavioral interventions,
particularly applied behavioral analysis in patients with intellectual
disability or autism spectrum disorders, are increasingly found to
be helpful. The sequelae related to an ingested item can require specific treatment (e.g., lead toxicity, iron-­deficiency anemia, parasitic
infestation). Ingestion of hair can require medical or surgical intervention for a gastric bezoar.

Sensory phenomena (premonitory urges) that precede and trigger
the urge to tic have been described. Individuals with tics can suppress
them for varying periods of time, particularly when external demands
exert their influence, when deeply engaged in a focused task or activity,
or during sleep. Tics are often suggestible and are worsened by anxiety, excitement, or exhaustion. Parents have described increasing frequency of tics at the end of the day.

CLINICAL COURSE

Onset of tics is typically between ages 4 and 6 years. The frequency
of tics tends to wax and wane with peak tic severity between ages 10
and 12 years and marked attenuation of tic severity in most individuals
(65%) by age 18-­20 years. A small percentage will have worsening tics
into adulthood. New onset of tics in adulthood is very rare and most
often is associated with exposure to drugs or insults to the central nervous system. Tics manifest similarly in all age groups, with changes in
affected muscle groups and vocalizations that occur over time. Some
individuals may have tic-­free periods of weeks to months.

EPIDEMIOLOGY

Prevalence rates for all tics range from 6–18% for males and 3–11%
for females, with the rate of TD alone estimated as 0.8%. In general,
PTD/TD has a male preponderance with a gender ratio varying from
2:1 to 4:1.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

The differential diagnosis includes other repetitive movements of
childhood (Table 37.2). Tics may be difficult to differentiate from stereotypies. Although stereotypies may resemble tics, stereotypies are

typically rhythmic movements and do not demonstrate the change
in body location or movement type over time that is typical of tics.
Compulsions may be difficult to differentiate from tics when tics have
premonitory urges. Tics should be differentiated from a variety of
developmental and benign movement disorders (e.g., benign paroxysmal torticollis, Sandifer syndrome, benign jitteriness of newborns,
shuddering attacks). Although tics may present in various neurologic
illnesses (e.g., Wilson disease, neuroacanthocytosis, Huntington syndrome, various frontal-­subcortical brain lesions), it is rare for tics to be
the only manifestation of these disorders (Table 37.3).
Individuals presenting with tics in the context of declining motor
or cognitive function should be referred for neurologic assessment.
Substances/medications that are reported to worsen tics include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), lamotrigine, and cocaine. If
tics develop in close temporal relationship to the use of a substance or
medication and then remit when use of the substance is discontinued,
a causal relationship is possible. Stimulants do not commonly increase
tics.

COMORBIDITIES

Comorbid psychiatric disorders are common, often with both patient
and family viewing the accompanying condition as more problematic than the tics. There is a bidirectional association between PTD/
TD (especially TD) and obsessive-­compulsive disorder (OCD), with
20–60% of TD patients meeting OCD criteria and 20–40% of OCD
patients reporting tics (Fig. 37.1). Attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) occurs in approximately 50% of all childhood PTD/
TD, but estimates in clinically referred patients suggest much higher
rates (60–80%). PTD/TD is often accompanied by behavior problems,
including poor frustration tolerance, temper outbursts, and oppositionality. Learning disabilities have been found in >20% of these
patients. Concurrent anxiety and depression have also been observed.
Some patients with PTD/TD will display symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD); careful assessment is required to determine
which disorder is primary.

ETIOLOGY

Tics are proposed to be the result of dysfunctional corticostriatal-­
thalamocortical motor pathways in the basal ganglia, striatum, and
frontal lobes associated with abnormalities in the dopamine, serotonin,
and norepinephrine neurotransmitter systems. Male predominance in
PTD/TD may be attributable to influences of sex hormones on the neurodevelopment of these motor pathways, as reflected by the effects of
antiandrogens in the treatment of TD.
Family studies suggest a 10-­100–fold increased risk of PTD/TD
among first-­degree relatives compared to rates in the general population. Twin studies also support a genetic link, with approximately 80%
of monozygotic twins and 30% of dizygotic twins showing concordance
for PTD/TD. Candidate-­gene association and nonparametric linkage
studies have not identified specific susceptibility genes for PTD/TD.
Autoimmune-­
mediated mechanisms have been hypothesized as
having a potential etiologic role in some tic disorders. The pediatric
autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS) designation describes cases of acute childhood onset of OCD and/or tics following a streptococcal infection.
Pediatric acute-­onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) describes a
subtype of acute childhood-­onset OCD (tics are not a required feature) in which a link to a prior streptococcal infection is not evident,
suggesting that other infectious agents may be responsible. In addition
to a diagnosis of OCD and tics, children with PANS/PANDAS may
potentially have separation anxiety, nightmares, personality change,
oppositional behaviors, and deterioration in math skills and handwriting. Although some studies suggest a prior history of infections may
increase the risk for developing tic disorder, this remains controversial.
Premorbid stress has been hypothesized to act as a sensitizing agent
in the pathogenesis of TD among susceptible individuals by affecting
stress-­responsive biologic systems such as the hypothalamic-­pituitary-­
adrenal axis.

the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with tic disorders. J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry. 2013;52(12):1341–1359.

SEQUELAE

Many individuals with mild to moderate tics express minimal to no
distress or functional impairment and may even be unaware of their
tics. Even individuals with moderate to severe tics can experience
minimal functional impairment, but psychologic distress may occur.
Infrequently, the presence of tics can lead to social isolation, social
victimization, inability to work or attend school, or impaired quality
of life. TD/PTD is associated with increased risk of suicide. Suicidal
behavior should be monitored, particularly in those with persistent
tics, history of suicide attempts, and psychiatric comorbidities.

SCREENING

Pediatric practitioners should routinely screen for unusual movements
(e.g., sudden twitches or jerks, eye blinking, neck twisting, muscle tightening, shoulder shrugging, or involuntary gestures) or vocalizations
(e.g., utter involuntary sounds, like grunts, yelps, squeaks, or throat
clears). Often families are unaware that frequent sniffing, coughing, or
blinking may be indicative of tics, attributing these behaviors to medical problems (e.g., allergies, visual problems). A careful assessment of
the timing, triggers, and specific characteristics may differentiate tics
from other medical problems. If differentiation is difficult, a referral to
a pediatric specialist in the affected system is warranted.

ASSESSMENT

If the screening suggests the presence of a tic disorder, a more comprehensive evaluation should ensue, including the age of onset,
types of tics, tic frequency, alleviating and aggravating factors, and
a family history of tics. Parent rating scales specific for tics (e.g., the
Motor Tic, Obsessions and Compulsions, Vocal Tic Evaluation Survey
[MOVES] and Autism-­Tics, ADHD and other Comorbidities inventory (A-­TAC) can supplement the assessment. For clinician-­rated tic
severity, the most comprehensive, reliable, and valid instrument is
the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS), though its relatively long
administration makes routine use in clinical practice problematic

(https://candapediatricmedicalhomes.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/
yale-­global-­tic-­severity-­scale.pdf).
A medical workup should be considered for new-­onset tics, particularly for presentations characterized by sudden onset, atypicality, or mental status abnormalities. Basic laboratory measures
(hemogram, renal/hepatic function panel, thyroid panel, and ferritin, along with urine drug screen for adolescents) should be considered. For new, sudden onset, or severe symptom exacerbation,
pediatric practitioners may assess for concurrent acute infection
(e.g., culture, rapid viral tests). Electroencephalography and brain
imaging are not routinely recommended for isolated tics and should
be reserved for patients with other neurologic findings that might
suggest an autoimmune encephalitis syndrome (limbic encephalitis). Comorbid psychiatric disorders (e.g., OCD, ADHD, ASD)
should be investigated.

TREATMENT

The decision to treat tics is made with the child and family based on the
level of impairment and distress caused by the tics. If tics are mild in
severity, the pediatric practitioner can provide the family with education, often with no need for further intervention.
Patient and family education should include common symptom
presentations, implications of concurrent conditions, course and prognosis, and treatment options (including no treatment). The patient’s
typical exacerbating and alleviating factors should be outlined. Pediatric practitioners can also direct the patient and family to informational websites, including the Tourette Association of America
(www.tourette.org).
Almost 75% of children with TD/PTD receive some form of classroom accommodation (e.g., directions to ignore tics and permission
to leave the room as needed). The accommodations may need to be
formalized in an individualized education plan (IEP) if a child needs
special education services or a 504 plan if the child just needs accommodations in the regular classroom.

Referral to a behavioral treatment specialist should be considered
when tics are distressing or functionally impairing. The behavioral
interventions with the strongest empirical support are habit reversal
therapy (HRT) and comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics
(CBIT). The basic components of HRT include premonitory urge
awareness training and building a competing response to the urge to
tic (Table 37.4). Based on HRT, CBIT additionally includes relaxation
training and a functional intervention designed to mitigate against
tic-­generating situations. A course of HRT/CBIT treatment typically
takes several months or 8-­10 sessions. CBIT has been found to reduce
significantly the severity of tics compared to education and supportive
therapy.
Medications should be considered when the tics are causing severe
impairment in the quality of life or when psychiatric comorbidities
are present. The only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–
approved medications to treat TD in children and adolescents are

two first-­generation antipsychotics (haloperidol, pimozide) and one
second-­generation antipsychotic (aripiprazole). α-­Agonists (clonidine,
guanfacine) are also considered as first-­line agents because of their
more favorable side effect profile compared with the antipsychotic
medications (see Chapter 33).
Youths with tic disorders may benefit from SSRIs for the treatment of comorbid obsessive-­
compulsive, anxiety, or depressive
disorders. Augmentation of SSRIs with an atypical antipsychotic
has been a consideration in patients with concurrent tic disorders
and OCD responding poorly to an SSRI alone. The presence of
tics does not preclude the use of stimulants to address comorbid
ADHD. Treatment of tics and comorbid ADHD with a combination of α-­agonists and stimulants (e.g., clonidine with methylphenidate) decreases tics. Close clinical monitoring is required for
possible exacerbation of tics during stimulant treatment. Anger and
rage outbursts are common particularly among youth with severe
tics (up to 80% in clinically referred samples). Behavioral therapies
(cognitive-­behavioral therapy [CBT], parent management training;
see Chapter 34) that address anger management may be useful.
A systematic review indicated high confidence of efficacy for
CBIT; moderate confidence for medications, such as haloperidol,
risperidone, aripiprazole, clonidine; and low confidence for medications, such as ziprasidone, guanfacine, and topiramate. No evidence exists to differentiate the effectiveness of HRT/CBIT alone vs
combined with pharmacotherapy as tic disorder treatment options.
There is no rigorous scientific evidence to support the use of deep
brain stimulation, repetitive magnetic stimulation, or dietary supplements in the treatment of TD or PTD.
In severe presentations, pediatric practitioners should consider
seeking consultations from and/or making referrals to pediatric tic
disorder specialists (i.e., behavioral psychologist, pediatric neurologist, developmental-­behavioral pediatrician, or child and adolescent psychiatrist) in determining a treatment regimen.

Chapter 37 u Motor Disorders and Habits

37.2 Stereotypic Movement Disorder
Jung Won Kim, Heather J. Walter, and David R. DeMaso
Stereotypic movement disorder (SMD) is defined in DSM-­5 as a
neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by repetitive, seemingly
driven, and apparently purposeless motor behavior (stereotypy) that
interferes with social, academic, or other activities and may result
in self-­injury. The onset of SMD is the early developmental period
(often before age 3 years), and the symptoms are not attributable to
the physiologic effects of a substance or neurologic condition and
are not better explained by another neurodevelopmental or mental disorder. The disorder is considered mild if symptoms are easily
suppressed by sensory stimulation or distraction, and severe if continuous monitoring and protective measures are required to prevent
serious injury, with moderate falling between mild and severe.

DESCRIPTION

Examples of stereotypic movements include hand shaking or waving, body rocking, head banging, self-­biting, and hitting one’s own
body. The presentation depends on the nature of the stereotypic
movement and level of the child’s awareness of the behavior. Among
typically developing children, the repetitive movements may be
stopped when attention is directed to the movements or when
the child is distracted from performing them. Among youth with
intellectual disability, the behaviors may be less responsive to such
efforts. Each individual presents with their own uniquely patterned
behavior. Stereotypic movements may occur many times during a
day, lasting a few seconds to several minutes or longer. The behaviors may occur in multiple contexts, including when the individual
is excited, stressed, fatigued, or bored.

CLINICAL COURSE

Stereotypic movements typically begin before age 3 years. In those who
develop complex motor stereotypies, the great majority exhibit these
symptoms before 24 months. In most typically developing youth, these
movements resolve over time. Among those with intellectual disability,
the stereotyped behaviors may persist for years, although the pattern
may change over time.

EPIDEMIOLOGY

Simple stereotypic movements are common in typically developing young children. Some children may bang their head on their
mattress as they are falling asleep or may sit and rock when bored
or overstimulated. Self-­injurious habits, such as self-­biting or head
banging, can occur in up to 25% of typically developing toddlers
(often during tantrums), but they are almost invariably associated
with developmental delay in youth older than 5 years. Complex stereotypic movements are much less common (approximately 3–4%).
Between 4% and 16% of patients with intellectual disability engage
in stereotypic movements.

COMORBIDITY

Stereotypic movements are a common manifestation of a variety of
neurogenetic disorders, such as Lesch-­Nyhan, Rett, fragile X, Cornelia
de Lange, and Smith-­Magenis syndromes.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

According to DSM-­5, stereotypic movements must be differentiated
from normal development, ASDs, tic disorders, OCDs, and other
neurologic/medical conditions. Simple stereotypic movements
occurring in the context of typical development usually resolve with
age. Stereotypic movements may be a presenting symptom of ASD,
but SMD does not include the deficits in the social communication
characteristic of ASD. When ASD is present, SMD is diagnosed only

245

when there is self-­injury or when the stereotypic behaviors are sufficiently severe to become a focus of treatment. Typically, SMD has
an earlier age of onset than the tic disorders. SMD is distinguished
from OCD by the absence of obsessions as well as the nature of
the repetitive behaviors, which in OCD are purposeful (e.g., in
response to obsessions). The diagnosis of stereotypic movements
requires the exclusion of mannerisms, paroxysmal dyskinesias, and
benign hereditary chorea. A neurologic history and examination
are required to assess features suggestive of other disorders, such as
myoclonus, dystonia, and chorea.

ETIOLOGY

There is a possible evolutionary link between repetitive abnormal
grooming-­like behaviors and early human experience with adversity. Brain regions implicated in this model (e.g., amygdala, hippocampus) are those involved in navigating human experience
through unpredictable, anxiety-­provoked emotional states, as well
as regions (e.g., nucleus accumbens) related to pleasure and reward
seeking. The latter involves the hypothesis that individuals experience some level of gratification from performing the stereotypic
behavior.
Social isolation with insufficient stimulation (e.g., severe neglect)
is a risk factor for self-­stimulation that may progress into stereotypies, particularly repetitive rocking or spinning. Environmental
stress may trigger stereotypic behaviors. Repetitive self-­injurious
behavior may be a behavioral phenotype in neurogenetic syndromes
(e.g., Lesch-­Nyhan, Rett, and Cornelia de Lange syndromes). Lower
cognitive functioning is also linked to greater risk of stereotypic
behaviors.

TREATMENT

The initial approach to mild stereotypy is for the primary caretakers to ignore the undesired behavior, encourage substitute behavior,
and not convey worry to their child. These behaviors may disappear
with time and elimination of attention in young children. However, in children with intellectual disability or ASDs, stereotypies
may be more refractory to treatment than in typically developing
children and may necessitate referral to a behavioral psychologist,
developmental-­behavioral pediatrician, or child and adolescent psychiatrist for behavioral and/or psychopharmacologic management.
The pediatric practitioner should consider and rule out neglect of
the child, which can be associated with repetitive rocking, spinning,
or other stereotypic movements.
Behavior therapy is the mainstay of treatment, using a variety of
strategies, including habit reversal, relaxation training, self-­monitoring,
contingency management, competing responses, and negative practice.
The environment should also be modified to reduce risk of injury to
those engaging in self-­injurious behavior.
Atypical antipsychotic medications may be helpful in reducing stereotypic movements in youth with ASD. Patients with anxiety and
obsessive-­compulsive behaviors treated with SSRIs may show improvement in their stereotypic movements.

HABITS

Habits involve an action or pattern of behavior that is repeated
often. Habits are common in childhood and range from usually
benign and transient behaviors (e.g., thumb sucking, nail biting)
to more problematic (e.g., trichotillomania, bruxism). In DSM-­5,
habits are not included as a diagnostic category because they are not
viewed as disorders causing clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning. When they do cause distress or impairment
or are associated with repeated attempts by the individual to stop
the behavior they are discussed as body-­focused repetitive behavior
disorder. HRT has been effective as a first-­line treatment approach
(see Table 37.4).

246 Part III u Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders
Table 37.4  Components of Habit Reversal Training
INCREASE INDIVIDUAL’S AWARENESS OF HABIT
Response description—have individual describe behavior to therapist
in detail while reenacting the behavior and looking in a mirror.
Response detection—inform individual of each occurrence of the
behavior until each occurrence is detected without assistance.
Early warning—have individual practice identifying earliest signs of
the target behavior.
Situation awareness—have individual describe all situations in which
the target behavior is likely to occur.
TEACH COMPETING RESPONSE TO HABIT
The competing response must result in isometric contraction of
muscles involved in the habit, be capable of being maintained for
3 min, and be socially inconspicuous and compatible with normal
ongoing activities but incompatible with the habit (e.g., clenching
one’s fist, grasping and clenching an object). For vocal tics and
stuttering, deep relaxed breathing with a slight exhale before
speech has been used as the competing response.
SUSTAIN COMPLIANCE
Habit inconvenience review—have individual review in detail all
problems associated with target behavior.
Social support procedure—family members and friends provide high
levels of praise when a habit-­free period is noted.
Public display—individual demonstrates to others that he or she
can control the target behavior in situations in which the behavior
occurred in the past.
FACILITATE GENERALIZATION—SYMBOLIC REHEARSAL
PROCEDURE
For each situation identified in situation awareness procedure,
individual imagines himself or herself beginning the target behavior
but stopping and engaging in the competing response.

Thumb Sucking

Thumb sucking is common in infancy and occurring in as many as
25% of children age 2 years and 15% of children age 5 years. Thumb
sucking beyond 5 years of age may be associated with sequelae (e.g.,
paronychia, anterior open bite). As with other rhythmic patterns of
behavior, thumb sucking is self-­soothing. Basic behavioral management, including encouraging parents to ignore thumb sucking and
instead focus on praising the child for substitute behaviors, is often
an effective treatment. Simple reminders and reinforcers can also
be considered; giving the child a sticker or other reward for each
block of time that they do not thumb suck. In rare cases, mechanical devices placed on the thumb or in the mouth to prevent thumb
sucking or noxious agents (bitter salves) placed on the thumb may
be part of the treatment plan.

Bruxism

Bruxism or teeth grinding is common (5–30% of children), can begin
in the first 5 years of life, and may be associated with daytime anxiety.
Persistent bruxism can manifest as muscular or temporomandibular
joint pain. Untreated bruxism can cause problems with dental occlusion. Helping the child find ways to reduce anxiety might relieve the
problem; bedtime can be made more relaxing by reading or talking
with the child and allowing the child to discuss fears. Praise and other
emotional support are useful. Persistent bruxism requires referral to a
dentist given the risk for dental occlusion.

Anxiety Disorders,
Obsessive-­Compulsive
Disorder, and Post­
traumatic Stress Disorder
Rosa K. Kim
Anxiety is not necessarily pathologic, is seen across the life span, and
can be adaptive (e.g., the anxiety one might feel during life-­threatening
situations). It has both a cognitive-­behavioral component, expressed in
worrying and wariness, and a physiologic component, mediated by the
autonomic nervous system. Anxiety is characterized as pathologic (e.g.,
a disorder) when it becomes disabling, interferes with social interactions, or derails normal development.
Anxiety disorders are some of the most common psychiatric disorders in childhood. The point prevalence worldwide is nearly 7%, and
the estimated lifetime prevalence in the United States is approximately
20–30%. Anxiety disorders are often comorbid with other psychiatric
and medical disorders, and they can have physical manifestations, such
as weight loss, palpitations, tremors, muscle cramps, paresthesias, hyperreflexia, and abdominal distress (Table 38.1). Although onset can be
acute, the course is generally chronic with periods of fluctuating severity.
The potential consequences of untreated anxiety include impairments
in social, educational, and overall functioning. Because anxiety is both
a normal phenomenon and, when highly activated, strongly associated
with impairment, the clinician is tasked with differentiating between
normal anxiety and abnormal anxiety across development (Fig. 38.1).
The median age of onset is 11 years. However, there are known periods of typical onset during specific developmental phases for both normal and pathologic anxiety. Normal stranger anxiety begins around
7-­9 months of age. Preschoolers typically have specific fears related to
the dark, animals, and imaginary situations. Separation anxiety can
occur during the preschool years. Although most school-­aged children
abandon the imaginary fears of early childhood, some replace them
with fears of bodily harm or other worries, reaching the level of a specific phobia (Table 38.2). Some characteristics of obsessive-­compulsive
disorder (OCD) can be considered typical in early school-­ages, but
OCD often has its onset in the mid–school-­aged years (Table 38.3).
Social anxiety occurs in later grade-­school ages and early adolescence
(Table 38.4) as the value of peer relationships increases. Generalized
anxiety, panic, and agoraphobia tend to occur during the teen and
young adult years (Tables 38.5 to 38.7).
Genetic or temperamental factors contribute more to the development of some anxiety disorders, whereas environmental factors are
closely linked to the cause of others. Specifically, behavioral inhibition
(sensitivity to novel stimuli) appears to be a heritable tendency and is
linked with social phobia, generalized anxiety, and selective mutism.
OCD and other disorders associated with OCD-­like behaviors, such as
Tourette syndrome and other tic disorders, tend to have high genetic
risk as well (see Chapter 37.1). Environmental factors, such as parent–
infant attachment and exposure to trauma, contribute more to separation anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
(Table 38.8). Parental anxiety disorder is associated with an increased
risk of anxiety disorder in offspring.

KEY CLINICAL INSIGHTS TO RECOGNIZE
Major depressive disorder is the highest comorbidity in anxiety disorder and
associated with higher severity, suicidality, disability and chronicity; clinicians
must comprehensively assess because major depressive disorder comorbidity
requires more intensive pharmacologic treatment and a different form of
psychotherapy treatment (e.g., cognitive-­behavioral therapy for depression
rather than for anxiety disorder)
Anxiety is often present in bipolar disorder and is associated with rapid
cycling; targeting anxiety could aid in mood stabilization; bipolar disorder
requires focus on mood stabilization and considerate use of medication, which
could induce mania (especially antidepressants)
People who have obsessive-­compulsive disorder engage in ritualistic,
repetitive behavior to deal with their fears, which is absent in anxiety disorder;
these people often realize that their behavior is irrational and inappropriate
The intense experience of anxiety in posttraumatic stress disorder is specifically
in response to a psychologic trauma (e.g., abuse, war, or accident); specific
psychotherapies focused on the trauma associated with the posttraumatic
stress disorder should be used
Anxiety is specifically related to preoccupation with having or acquiring a
serious, undiagnosed medical illness
When suspected, clinicians should conduct a psychiatric interview of substance
use disorders, with potential breath, urine, or plasma drug screening;
comorbidity of alcohol or benzodiazepine abuse with anxiety disorder is
considerable

Chest pain or palpitations (which is
also common in panic disorder)
Palpitations, tremor, panic attacks,
or persistent anxiety
Shortness of breath

Clinical evaluation, including electrocardiogram, assessment of plasma troponin
concentration, or Holter monitoring
Laboratory assessment of plasma thyroid-­stimulating hormone

Panic attacks or bodily sensations

Blood pressure monitoring over 24 hr or hormone assessment (e.g., in blood or
urine)

Anxiety symptoms as part of aura
or start of seizure

Clinical evaluation or neurologic referral when the causes of symptoms are
unclear

Clinical evaluation with a pulmonary function test

*In previous classifications of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and International Classification of Diseases, these disorders were included in the classification
of anxiety disorders. In current classifications (e.g., the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the 11th edition of the International
Classification of Diseases), they are integrated in different classifications.

ASSESSMENT

There is no recommendation for routine screening of children and
adolescents for anxiety disorders. Freely available general screening
instruments such as the Pediatric Symptom Checklist and Strengths
and Difficulties Questionnaire can be used to identify anxiety concerns
in primary care and school settings. Rating scales can be used to support diagnosis and to follow response to treatment, but they are not
diagnostic on their own. Commonly used anxiety rating scales include
the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED),
the Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale (SCAS), the Preschool Anxiety
Scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-­7 (GAD-­7), and the Patient
Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)
Pediatric Short Form-­Anxiety-­8a.
Symptoms of anxiety are typically identified through the clinical
interview by asking questions about “worries,” “fears,” and “stress” or
by the patient and family’s spontaneous report. The interview must be
developmentally sensitive, and further discussions with the family may
reveal environmental reinforcements, including the caregiver’s parenting style and enabling of avoidance behaviors.
Because some degree of anxiety is considered normal, it is important to clarify when the symptom severity reaches the point of being
pathologic and to differentiate between the subtypes (Table 38.9). The
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition
(DSM-­5) has specific criteria for each type of anxiety with requirements for frequency, duration, and extent of functional impairment.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS AND COMORBIDITIES

In addition to determining whether diagnostic criteria are met for
a specific anxiety disorder, it is also crucial to rule out alternative
explanations. The differential diagnosis includes numerous medical

249

Table 38.6  DSM-­5 Diagnostic Criteria for Panic Disorder
A.	Recurrent unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is an abrupt
surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak
within minutes, and during which time four (or more) of the
following symptoms occur:
Note: The abrupt surge can occur from a calm state or an anxious
state.
1.	Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate.
2.	Sweating.
3.	Trembling or shaking.
4.	Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering.
5.	Feelings of choking.
6.	Chest pain or discomfort.
7.	Nausea or abdominal distress.
8.	Feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-­headed, or faint.
9.	Chills or heart sensations.
10.	Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations).
11.	Derealizations (feeling or unreality) or depersonalization
(being detached from oneself).
12. Fear of losing control or “going crazy.”
13.	Fear of dying.
Note: Culture-­specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness,
headache, uncontrollable screaming or crying) may be seen. Such
symptoms should not count as one of the four required symptoms.
B.	At least one of the attacks has been followed by 1 mo (or more) of
one or both of the following:
1.	Persistent concern or worry about additional panic attacks or
their consequences (e.g., losing control, having a heart attack,
“going crazy”).
2.	A significant maladaptive change in behavior related to the
attacks (e.g., behaviors designed to avoid having panic attacks,
such as avoidance of exercise or unfamiliar situations).
C.	The disturbance is not attributable to the physiologic effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical
condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism, cardiopulmonary disorders).
D.	The disturbance is not better explained by another mental
disorder (e.g., the panic attacks do not occur only in response to
feared social situations, as in social anxiety disorder; in response
to circumscribed phobic objects or situations, as in specific
phobia; in response to obsessions, as in obsessive-­compulsive
disorder; or in response to reminders of traumatic events, as in
posttraumatic stress disorder; or in response to separation from
attachment figures, as in separation anxiety disorder).

conditions and medication-­induced anxiety (Table 38.10). Anxiety disorders also frequently occur with not just other anxiety subtypes but
also other psychiatric comorbidities, notably depression and substance
use disorders (Table 38.11; see Table 38.1).

TREATMENT OF ANXIETY
Cognitive-­Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

Cognitive-­behavioral therapy (CBT) is a therapy that targets the cognitions, behaviors, and physiologic symptoms of anxiety, with a particular focus on the interconnections between the three. Its framework
typically involves homework assignments for practicing the skills in
real-­life environments. The goal is to achieve functional improvement
within approximately 18 sessions. Because it is a skills-­based treatment,
CBT is thought to be a durable treatment, an important consideration
when treating children and adolescents. It is specifically recommended
to patients 6-­18 years old with social anxiety, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, specific phobia, and panic disorder.
Specialized training and experience are paramount to the effective
delivery of this treatment modality, and it is worth taking the time to
ensure that patients identify therapists with the training and experience
to provide rigorous CBT. CBT typically should incorporate graduated
exposure, in which stepwise mastery of a hierarchy of fearful stimuli
results in desensitization.

250 Part III u Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders
Table 38.7  DSM-­5 Diagnostic Criteria for Agoraphobia
A.	Marked fear or anxiety about two (or more) of the following five situations:
1.	Using public transportation (e.g., automobiles, buses, trains, ships, planes).
2.	Being in open spaces (e.g., parking lots, marketplaces, bridges).
3.	Being in enclosed places (e.g., shops, theaters, cinemas).
4.	Standing in line or being in a crowd.
5.	Being outside of the home alone.
B.	The individual fears or avoids these situations because of thoughts that escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of
a developing panic-­like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms (e.g., fear or falling in the elderly, fear of incontinence).
C.	The agoraphobic situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety.
D.	The agoraphobic situations are actively avoided, require the presence of a companion, or are endured with intense fear or anxiety.
E.	The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the agoraphobic situations and to the sociocultural context.
F.	The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 mo or more.
G.	The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important area of
functioning.
H.	If another medical condition (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson disease) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly
excessive.
I.	The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms or another mental disorder—for example, the symptoms are
not confined to specific phobia or situational type; do not involve only social situations (as in social anxiety disorder); and are not related
exclusively to obsessions (as in obsessive-­compulsive disorder), reminders or traumatic events (as in posttraumatic stress disorder), or fear of
separation (as in separation anxiety disorder).
Note: Agoraphobia is diagnosed irrespective of the presence of panic disorder. If an individual’s presentation meets criteria for panic disorder
and agoraphobia, both diagnoses should be assigned.

Table 38.8  DSM-­5 Diagnostic Criteria for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER
Note: The following criteria apply to adults, adolescents, and children older than 6 yr. For children 6 yr and younger, see corresponding criteria
below.
A.	Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence in one (or more) of the following ways:
1.	Directly experiencing the traumatic event(s).
2.	Witnessing, in person, the event(s) as it occurred to others.
3.	Learning that the traumatic event(s) occurred to a close family member or close friend. In cases of actual or threatened death of a family
member or friend, the event(s) must have been violent or accidental.
4.	Experiencing repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of the traumatic event(s) (e.g., first responders collecting human remains;
police officers repeatedly exposed to details of child abuse).
Note: Criterion A4 does not apply to exposure through electronic media, television, movies, or pictures, unless this exposure is work related.
B.	Presence of one (or more) of the following intrusion symptoms associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning after the traumatic event(s)
occurred:
1.	Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic event(s).
Note: In children older than 6 yr, repetitive play may occur in which themes or aspects of the traumatic event(s) are expressed.
2.	Recurrent distressing dreams in which the content and/or effect of the dream are related to the traumatic event(s).
Note: In children, there may be frightening dreams without recognizable content.
3.	Dissociative reactions (e.g., flashbacks) in which the individual feels or acts as if the traumatic event(s) were recurring. (Such reactions may
occur on a continuum, with the more extreme expression being a complete loss or awareness of present surroundings.)
Note: In children, trauma-­specific reenactment may occur in play.
4.	Intense or prolonged psychologic distress at exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic
event(s).
5.	Marked physiologic reactions to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event(s).
C.	Persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning after the traumatic event(s) occurred, as evidenced by one or
both of the following:
1.	Avoidance of or efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s).
2.	Avoidance of or efforts to avoid external reminders (people, places, conversations, activities, objects, situations) that arouse distressing
memories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s).
D.	Negative alterations in cognitions and mood associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning or worsening after the traumatic event(s)
occurred, as evidenced by two (or more) of the following:
1.	Inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event(s) (typically due to dissociative amnesia and not to other factors such as
head injury, alcohol, or drugs).
2. Persistent and exaggerated negative beliefs or expectations about oneself, others, or the world (e.g., “I am bad,” “No one can be
trusted,” “The world is completely dangerous,” “My whole nervous system is permanently ruined”).
3.	Persistent, distorted cognitions about the cause or consequences of the traumatic event(s) that lead the individual to blame himself/herself
or others.
4.	Persistent negative emotional state (e.g., fear, horror, anger, guilt, or shame).
5.	Markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities.

Depersonalization: Persistent or recurrent experiences of feeling detached from, and as if one were an outside observer of, one’s mental
processes or body (e.g., feeling as though one were in a dream; feeling a sense of unreality of self or body or of time moving slowly).
2.	
Derealization: Persistent or recurrent experiences of unreality of surroundings (e.g., the world around the individual is experienced as
unreal, dreamlike, distant, or distorted).
Note: To use this subtype, the dissociative symptoms must not be attributable to the physiologic effects of a substance (e.g., blackouts, behavior
during alcohol intoxication) or another medical condition (e.g., complex partial seizures).
Specify if:

symptoms may be immediate).
POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER FOR CHILDREN 6 YEARS AND YOUNGER
A.	In children 6 yr and younger, exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence in one (or more) of the following ways:
1.	Directly experiencing the traumatic event(s).
2.	Witnessing, in person, the event(s) as it occurred to others, especially primary caregivers.
Note: Witnessing does not include events that are only in electronic media, television, movies, or pictures.
3.	Learning that the traumatic event(s) occurred to a parent or caregiving figure.
B.	Presence of one (or more) of the following intrusion symptoms associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning after the traumatic event(s)
occurred:
1.	Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic event(s).
Note: Spontaneous and intrusive memories may not necessarily appear distressing and may be expressed as play reenactment.
2.	Recurrent distressing dreams in which the content and/or effect of the dream is related to the traumatic event(s).
Note: It may not be possible to ascertain that the frightening content is related to the traumatic event.
3.	Dissociative reactions (e.g., flashbacks) in which the child feels or acts as if the traumatic event(s) were recurring. (Such reactions may occur
on a continuum, with the most extreme expression being a complete loss of awareness of present surroundings.) Such trauma-­specific
reenactment may occur in play.
4.	Intense or prolonged psychologic distress at exposure to internal or external cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic
event(s).
C.	One (or more) of the following symptoms, representing either persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the traumatic event(s) or
negative alterations in cognitions and mood associated with the traumatic event(s), must be present, beginning after the event(s) or worsening
after the event(s):
PERSISTENT AVOIDANCE OF STIMULI
1.	Avoidance of or efforts to avoid activities, places, or physical reminders that arouse recollections or the traumatic event(s).
2.	Avoidance of or efforts to avoid people, conversations, or interpersonal situations around recollections of the traumatic event(s).
NEGATIVE ALTERATIONS IN COGNITIONS
3.	Substantially increased frequency of negative emotional states (e.g., fear, guilt, sadness, shame, confusion).
4.	Markedly diminished interest or participation in significant activities, including constriction of play.
5.	Socially withdrawn behavior.
6.	Persistent reduction in expression of positive emotions.
D.	Alterations in arousal and reactivity associated with the traumatic event(s), beginning or worsening after the traumatic event(s) occurred, as
evidenced by two (or more) of the following:
1.	Irritable behavior and angry outbursts (with little or no provocation), typically expressed as verbal and physical aggression toward people or
objects (including extreme temper tantrums).
2.	Hypervigilance.
3.	Exaggerated startle response.
4.	Problems with concentration.
5.	Sleep disturbance (e.g., difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep or restless sleep).
E.	The duration of the disturbance is more than 1 mo.
F.	The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in relationships with parents, siblings, peers, or other caregivers or with
school behavior.
G.	The disturbance is not attributable to the physiologic effects of a substance (e.g., medication or alcohol) or another medical condition.

All of the SSRIs carry a “black box” warning for suicidal thinking and
behavior through age 24 years, and this specific risk must be discussed
with the patient and caregiver and documented before initiation. Other
potential adverse effects include behavioral activation, hypomanic or
manic symptoms, and serotonin syndrome (see Chapter 33).

Combination Treatment

The combination of CBT and an SSRI is generally thought to be better
than either treatment alone for moderate to severe anxiety. It is important to continue recommending CBT even after the decision has been
made to start pharmacologic treatment.

Serotonin-­Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors
component of treatment, and specific plans for anxiety management can
be included in a child’s 504 plan or individualized education plan (IEP).
The therapy with the most evidence for PTSD is a subtype of CBT
called trauma-­focused CBT (TF-­CBT). Given that standard anxiety
medications are less effective in PTSD, it is particularly crucial that
clinicians refer these patients to trauma-­focused therapy. In TF-­CBT,
the therapist amplifies stress management techniques in preparation
for exposure-­based interventions with the goal of achieving mastery
over trauma triggers. In small adult trials, ketamine-­or 3,4-­methyl
enedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-­assisted therapy have shown
benefit. There is insufficient evidence to currently recommend either
therapy.

Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as a class are effective in
treating anxiety. The available options include citalopram, escitalopram,
fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, and vilazodone. Despite
randomized clinical trials (RCTs) providing support for the safety and
effectiveness of this medication class, no specific SSRIs are U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)–approved for anxiety in children. SSRIs are
generally well tolerated, with the most common side effects involving
xerostomia, gastrointestinal upset, headache, somnolence or insomnia,
dizziness, fatigue, and changes in appetite (see Chapter 33).
RCTs in children and adolescents with PTSD found no significant difference between SSRI and placebo. SSRIs may be considered in pediatric
patients with PTSD who have comorbid conditions responsive to SSRIs,
including depression, affective numbing, and anxiety (see Table 33.5).

Duloxetine is a serotonin-­norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI)
and has an FDA indication for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in children ages 7-­17. However, it is still considered a second-­line
treatment as SSRIs tend to be more effective. The other SNRI options
are venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine. Potential side effects of duloxetine include xerostomia, diaphoresis, abdominal discomfort, gastrointestinal distress, headache, tremor, sedation or insomnia, decreased
appetite, and weight loss. Of note, it is less likely to cause behavioral
activation than the SSRIs.

α-­Agonists

Clonidine and guanfacine are α-­agonists and may be helpful for PTSD
by targeting sleep disturbances like nightmares, persistent physiologic
arousal, and exaggerated startle response.

OBSESSIVE-­COMPULSIVE DISORDER AND
PEDIATRIC ACUTE-­ONSET NEUROPSYCHIATRIC
SYNDROME

Obsessive-­
compulsive symptoms can be effectively treated with
SSRIs (sertraline, fluoxetine). If the patient’s symptoms prove to be
treatment-­refractory to the standard options, then one might consider
fluvoxamine and/or clomipramine, which is a heterocyclic antidepressant. These are indicated when a patient has failed two or more SSRI
trials. Habit reversal training is an important nonpharmacologic treatment modality for OCD as well.
A proportion of abrupt-­onset OCD cases are attributed to an immune
response that targets the brain (pediatric acute-­onset neuropsychiatric
syndrome [PANS]). The immune response may be brought about by

CRITERION 1
Abrupt, dramatic onset of obsessive-­compulsive disorder or severely

Concurrent presence of additional neuropsychiatric symptoms with

Symptoms are not better explained by a known neurologic or
medical disorder, such as Sydenham chorea, systemic lupus
erythematosus, Tourette disorder, autoimmune encephalitis, or
others. The diagnostic workup of patients with suspected PANS
must be comprehensive enough to rule out these and other relevant
disorders. The nature of the co-­occurring symptoms will dictate
the necessary assessments, which may include MRI scans, lumbar
puncture, electroencephalograms, or other diagnostic tests.

infections (commonly, but not exclusively, streptococcal infections) or
other mechanisms that activate the immune system.
There are no DSM-­5 diagnostic criteria for PANS. One suggested
approach to PANS diagnostic criteria is noted in Table 38.12. Of note
is the abrupt-­sudden onset of OCD, the presence of additional psychiatric disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, emotional lability), and the
requirement to rule out other disorders like Sydenham chorea.
If PANS is suspected, a comprehensive evaluation is warranted
primarily to rule out neurologic and medical conditions (see Table
38.12). Children with an abrupt onset of psychiatric and neurologic findings should be evaluated with MRI, electroencephalogram (EEG), and blood plus cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) autoimmune
encephalitis antibody testing. Children with a sudden onset of only
psychiatric symptoms (OCD, tics, anxiety) do not require extensive testing except for testing for a group A streptococcus, unless
they have severe and disabling psychiatric features, The latter group
should be evaluated to rule out the disorders noted in Table 38.12.
Once diagnosed, clinicians should prioritize the target symptoms of
the individual patient and select treatments accordingly. The three
realms of PANS treatment are psychotherapeutic, antimicrobial,
and immunomodulatory. Because behavioral interventions take
time to work, psychiatric interventions should begin expeditiously
for symptomatic relief. Antibiotics may eliminate the underlying
source of neuroinflammation, and immunomodulatory options can
help treat immune system disturbances.

SPECIFIC PHOBIAS

Specific phobias may not typically require treatment with an SSRI
and may be better targeted with exposure response prevention therapies and with premedicating with a β blocker before an anticipated
exposure. The exception to this is needle phobia; premedication
with a β blocker is not indicated in this instance because of the risk
of exacerbating the vasovagal response. Physical maneuvers, such
as crossing the legs and tensing the muscles, may be effective in
needle phobia.

Mood Disorders
Colleen K. Manak and Rosa K. Kim
Mood disorders encompass several different entities on the spectrum
between depression and mania. Mood disorders are interrelated sets
of psychiatric symptoms characterized by a core deficit in emotional
self-­
regulation. Classically, the mood disorders have been divided
into depressive and bipolar disorders, representing the two emotional
polarities, dysphoric (“low”) and euphoric (“high”) mood. Mood disorders in children and adolescents are highly prevalent and are the most
common psychiatric illnesses seen after attention-­deficit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) and anxiety. Primary care is often their first point of
contact when seeking treatment.

39.1 Depressive Disorders
Colleen K. Manak and Rosa K. Kim
Depressive disorders include major depressive, persistent depressive,
disruptive mood dysregulation, other specified/unspecified depressive,
premenstrual dysphoric, and substance/medication-­
induced disorders, as well as depressive disorder caused by another medical condition (Fig. 39.1).

DESCRIPTION

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by a distinct
period of at least 2 weeks (an episode) in which there is a depressed or
irritable mood and/or loss of interest or pleasure in almost all activities that is present for most of the day, nearly every day (Table 39.1
and Fig. 39.2). Major depression is associated with characteristic vegetative and cognitive symptoms, including disturbances in appetite,
sleep, energy, and activity level; impaired concentration; thoughts
of worthlessness or guilt; and suicidal thoughts or actions. Major
depression is considered mild if few or no symptoms in excess of
those required to make the diagnosis are present, and the symptoms
are mildly distressing, manageable, and result in minor functional
impairment. Major depression is considered severe if symptoms substantially in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are present, and the symptoms are highly distressing, unmanageable, and
markedly impair function. Moderate major depression is intermediate in severity (Fig. 39.3).
Persistent depressive disorder is characterized by depressed or irritable mood for more days than not, for at least 1 year (in children and
adolescents). This chronic form of depression is associated with characteristic vegetative and cognitive symptoms; however, the cognitive
symptoms of persistent depression are less severe (e.g., low self-­esteem
rather than worthlessness, hopelessness rather than suicidality). Persistent depressive disorder is characterized as mild, moderate, or severe
(Table 39.2).
Overall, the clinical presentation of major and persistent depressive disorders in children and adolescents is similar to that in adults.
The prominence of the symptoms can change with age: irritability and
somatic complaints may be more common in children, and energy,
activity level, appetite, and sleep disturbances may be more common
in adolescents. Because of the cognitive and linguistic immaturity of
young children, symptoms of depression in that age group may be
more likely to be observed than self-­reported.
The core feature of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder
(DMDD) is severe, persistent irritability evident most of the day,
nearly every day, for at least 12 months in multiple settings (at
home, at school, with peers). The irritable mood is interspersed

A.	Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present
during the same 2-wk period and represent a change from previous
functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed
mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.
1.	Depressed most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by
either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or
observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful).
Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.
1.	Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all,
activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by
either subjective account or observation).
2.	Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g.,
a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or
decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day.
Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.
1.	Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
2.	Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day
(observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of
restlessness or being slowed down).
3.	Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.

4.	Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt
(which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely
self-­reproach or guilt about being sick).
5.	Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness,
nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed
by others).
6.	Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent
suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt
or a specific plan for committing suicide.
B.	The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
C.	The episode is not attributable to the physiologic effects of a
substance or to another medical condition.
Note: Criteria A-­C represent a major depressive episode.
D.	The occurrence of the major depressive episode is not better
explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform
disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and unspecified
schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders.
E.	There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode.

with frequent (≥3 times/week) and severe temper outbursts (verbal
rages, physical aggression; Table 39.3). This diagnosis is intended
to characterize more accurately the extreme irritability, which some
investigators had considered a developmental presentation of bipolar disorder, and to distinguish extreme irritability from the milder
presentations characteristic of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)
and intermittent explosive disorder. Table 39.4 highlights some of
the similarities and differences between the various mood disorders
and also factors that distinguish mood disorders from grief experienced in response to loss.
Other specified/unspecified depressive disorder (subsyndromal
depressive disorder) applies to presentations in which symptoms
characteristic of a depressive disorder are present and cause clinically significant distress or functional impairment but do not meet
the full criteria for any of the disorders in this diagnostic class.

EPIDEMIOLOGY

The current prevalence of depressive disorder in the United States among
3-­17 year olds is approximately 3.2%; the lifetime prevalence rates increase
to 4.9% for ages 6-­17 and to 12.8% for 12-­17 year olds. The male:female
ratio (excluding DMDD) is approximately 1:1 during childhood and
beginning in early adolescence rises to 1:1.5-­3.0 by adulthood.
Based on rates of chronic and severe persistent irritability, which is
the core feature of DMDD, the overall 6 month to 1 year prevalence
has been estimated in the 2–5% range. In three community samples,
the 3-month prevalence rate of DMDD ranged from 0.8–3.3%, with
the highest rates occurring in preschoolers (although Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition [DSM-­5] does not
permit this diagnosis until age 6 years). Approximately 5–10% of children and adolescents are estimated to have subsyndromal (unspecified) depression.

ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS

Models of vulnerability to depressive disorders are grounded in genetic
and environmental pathways. Genetic studies have demonstrated the
heritability of depressive disorders, with monozygotic twin studies finding concordance rates of 40–65%. In families, both bottom-­up (children
to parents) and top-­down (parents to children) studies have shown
a two- to four–fold bidirectional increase in depression among first-­
degree relatives. Cerebral variations in structure and function (particularly serotonergic), the function of the hypothalamic-­pituitary-­adrenal
axis, difficult temperament/personality (i.e., negative affectivity), and

ruminative, self-­devaluating cognitive style have been implicated as
components of biologic vulnerability. The great majority of depressive
disorders arise in youth with long-­standing psychosocial difficulties,
among the most predictive of which are physical/sexual abuse, neglect,
chronic illness, school difficulties (bullying, academic failure), social
isolation, family or marital disharmony, divorce/separation, parental
psychopathology, and domestic violence. Longitudinal studies demonstrate the greater importance of environmental influences in children
who become depressed than in adults who become depressed. Factors
shown to be protective against the development of depression include
better family function, a prosocial peer group, higher IQ, greater educational aspirations, a positive relationship with a caregiver, and closer
caregiver supervision, monitoring, and involvement.

Fig. 39.2 Defining major depressive disorder. Key symptoms of Diag-

nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM)­5 for major depressive disorder. For a diagnosis of major depressive
disorder, the individual needs to present with five or more of any of
the symptoms nearly every day during the same 2-­week period, provided at least one of these symptoms is a fundamental one. The clinical
symptoms of major depressive disorder are usually accompanied by
functional impairment. The greater the number and severity of symptoms (as opposed to particular symptoms), the greater the probability
of the functional impairment they are likely to confer. The symptoms
of depression can be grouped into emotional, neurovegetative, and
neurocognitive domains. Importantly sleep, weight, and appetite are
usually diminished in depression but can also be increased, and suicidal ideation, plans, or an attempt should be documented whenever
depression is suspected. (From Malhi GS, Mann JJ. Depression. Lancet.
2018;392[10161]:2299–2312:Fig. 1, p. 2300.)

Adolescents presenting in the primary care setting should be queried,
along with their caregiver(s), about depressed mood as part of the routine clinical interview. A typical screening question would be, “Everyone feels sad or angry some of the time; how about you (or your teen)?”
The caregivers of younger children can be queried about overt signs of
depression, such as tearfulness, irritability, boredom, or social isolation. A number of standardized screening instruments widely used in
the primary care setting (e.g., Pediatric Symptom Checklist, Strengths
and Difficulties Questionnaire, Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating
Scales) have items specific to sad mood and as such can be used to focus
the interview. Additionally, screening tools specific to depression, such
as the Patient Health Questionnaire-­9 (PHQ-­9) and Beck Depression
Inventory, can be utilized as part of routine screening (Table 39.5).
The role of universal depression screening using standardized
depression-­specific instruments is unclear. A Cochrane review found
that the use of depression screening in primary care has little or no
impact on the recognition, management, or outcome of depression.
Nonetheless, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends the universal use of depression screening instruments, but only
among adolescents and only when systems are in place to ensure adequate follow-­up. Targeted screening of known high-­risk groups (e.g.,
youth who are homeless, refugees, attracted to the same sex, involved
with child welfare or juvenile justice), or youth experiencing known
psychosocial adversities or self-­reporting a dysphoric mood, may be a
higher-­yield case-­finding strategy than universal screening.

Assessment

Youth (and/or their caregivers) presenting in the primary care setting
who self-­report, or respond affirmatively to queries about a distressing
life experience or a depressed or irritable mood should be offered the
opportunity to talk about the situation with the pediatric practitioner
(separately with the older youth). By engaging in active listening (e.g.,

melancholic features and has partly remitted in response to initial treatment. (From Malhi GS, Mann JJ. Depression. Lancet. 2018;392[10161]:2299–

Table 39.2  DSM-­5 Diagnostic Criteria for Persistent
­Depressive Disorder

Table 39.3  DSM-­5 Diagnostic Criteria for Disruptive Mood
Dysregulation Disorder

A.	Depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, as
indicated either by subjective account or observation by others,
for at least 2 yr.
Note: In children and adolescents, mood can be irritable and
duration must be at least 1 yr.
B.	Presence, while depressed, of two (or more) of the following:
1.	Poor appetite or overeating.
2.	Insomnia or hypersomnia.
3.	Low energy or fatigue.
4.	Low self-­esteem.
5.	Poor concentration or difficulty making decisions.
6.	Feelings of hopelessness.
C.	During the 2 yr period (1 yr for children or adolescents) of the
disturbance, the individual has never been without the symptoms
in Criteria A and B for more than 2 mo at a time.
D.	Criteria for a major depressive disorder may be continuously
present for 2 yr.
E.	There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode,
and criteria have never been met for cyclothymic disorder.
F.	The disturbance is not better explained by a persistent
schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, delusional disorder, or
other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other
psychotic disorder.
G.	The symptoms are not attributable to the physiologic effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another
medical condition (e.g., hypothyroidism).
H.	The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
Note: Because the criteria for a major depressive episode include
four symptoms that are absent from the symptom list for persistent
depressive disorder (dysthymia), a very limited number of individuals
will have depressive symptoms that have persisted longer than 2
yr but will not meet criteria for persistent depressive disorder. If
full criteria for a major depressive episode have been met at some
point during the current episode of illness, they should be given
a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Otherwise, a diagnosis
of other specified depressive disorder or unspecified depressive
disorder is warranted.

A.	Severe recurrent temper outbursts manifested verbally (e.g.,
verbal rages) and/or behaviorally (e.g., physical aggression toward
people or property) that are grossly out of proportion in intensity
or duration to the situation or provocation.
B.	The temper outbursts are inconsistent with developmental level.
C.	The temper outbursts occur, on average, three or more times per
week.
D.	The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable or
angry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by
others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers).
E.	Criteria A-­D have been present for 12 or more months.
Throughout that time, the individual has not had a period lasting
3 or more consecutive months without all of the symptoms in
Criteria A-­D.
F.	Criteria A and D are present in at least two of three settings (i.e.,
at home, at school, with peers) and are severe in at least one of
these.
G.	The diagnosis should not be made for the first time before age 6
yr or after age 18 yr.
H.	By history or observation, the age at onset of Criteria A-­E is
before 10 yr.
I.	There has never been a distinct period lasting more than 1 day
during which the full symptom criteria, except duration, for a
manic or hypomanic episode have been met.
Note: Developmentally appropriate mood elevation, such as occurs
in the context of a highly positive event or its anticipation, should
not be considered as a symptom of mania or hypomania.
J.	The behaviors do not occur exclusively during an episode of
major depressive disorder and are not better explained by another
mental disorder (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, posttraumatic
stress disorder, separation anxiety disorder, persistent depressive
disorder [dysthymia]).
Note: The diagnosis cannot coexist with oppositional defiant
disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, or bipolar disorder,
though it can coexist with others, including major depressive
disorder, attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct
disorder, and substance use disorders. Individuals whose
symptoms meet criteria for both disruptive mood dysregulation
disorder and oppositional defiant disorder should only be given
the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. If an
individual has ever experienced a manic or hypomanic episode,
the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should
not be assigned.
K.	The symptoms are not attributable to the physiologic effects of a
substance or to another medical or neurologic condition.

“I hear how upset you have been feeling; tell me more about what happened to make you feel that way”), the clinician can begin to assess the
onset, duration, context, and severity of the symptoms and associated
dangerousness, distress, and functional impairment. In the absence of
acute dangerousness (e.g., suicidality, psychosis, substance abuse) and
significant distress or functional impairment, the pediatric practitioner
can schedule a follow-­up appointment within 1-­2 weeks to conduct a
depression assessment. At this follow-­up visit, to assist with decision-­
making about appropriate level of care, a depression-­specific screening
or standardized rating scale can be administered to assess symptom
severity (see Table 39.5), and additional risk factors can be explored.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

A number of psychiatric disorders, general medical conditions, and
medications can generate symptoms of depression or irritability and
must be distinguished from the depressive disorders. The psychiatric
disorders include autism spectrum disorder (ASD), ADHD, and bipolar, anxiety, trauma-­and stressor-­related, disruptive/impulse control/
conduct, and substance-­related disorders. Medical conditions include
neurologic disorders (including autoimmune encephalitis), endocrine
disorders (including hypothyroidism and Addison disease), infectious
diseases, tumors, anemia, uremia, failure to thrive, chronic fatigue disorder, and pain disorder. Medications include narcotics, chemotherapy
agents, β blockers, corticosteroids, and contraceptives. The diagnosis

of a depressive disorder should be made after these and other potential
explanations for the observed symptoms have been ruled out.

COMORBIDITY

Major and persistent depressive disorders often co-­occur with other
psychiatric disorders. Depending on the setting and source of referral, 40–90% of youths with a depressive disorder have other psychiatric
disorders, and up to 50% have two or more comorbid diagnoses. The
most common comorbid diagnosis is an anxiety disorder and as such
may reflect a common diathesis; other common comorbidities include
ADHD and disruptive behavior, eating, and substance use disorders.
The development of depressive disorders can both lead to and follow
the development of comorbid disorders.
DMDD may occur with other psychiatric disorders, including other
depressive disorders, ADHD, conduct disorder, and substance use disorders. Because the symptoms of DMDD overlap in part with symptoms of bipolar disorder, ODD, and intermittent explosive disorder, by
DSM-­5 convention, hierarchical diagnostic rules apply. Thus bipolar
disorder takes precedence over DMDD if a manic/hypomanic episode

TREATMENT

Treatment decisions should be guided by the understanding that
depression in youth is highly responsive to placebo (50–60%) or brief
nonspecific intervention (15–30%). The goal of treatment is remission,
defined as a period of at least 2 weeks with no or very few depressive
symptoms, and ultimately recovery, defined as a period of at least 2
months with no or very few depressive symptoms. Assessment of
remission and recovery can be aided using the depression-­specific
standardized rating scales, in which remission is defined as scores
below the scale-­specific clinical cut point.
For mild symptoms (manageable and not functionally impairing)
and in the absence of major risk factors (e.g., suicidality; psychosis;
substance use; history of depression, mania, or traumatic exposures;
parental psychopathology, particularly depression; severe family
dysfunction), guided self-­help (anticipatory guidance) with watchful waiting and scheduled follow-­up may suffice. Guided self-­help

can include provision of educational materials (e.g., pamphlets,
books, workbooks, apps, internet sites) that provide information
to the youth about coping adaptively with stressful situations, as
well as advice to caregivers about strengthening the caregiver–
child relationship and modifying triggering exposures (e.g., taking
action against bullying, increasing opportunities for social interaction and support, protecting child from exposure to marital discord). Additional self-­help activities that have shown promise in
improving mild depressive symptoms include behavioral activation
(e.g., physical exercise, social engagement, participation in a
hobby), mindfulness (e.g., yoga, meditation), and a regular sleep
schedule.
For youths who continue to have mild depression after a few weeks
of guided self-­help, supportive therapy by a mental health professional may be an appropriate subsequent step. For youths who have
not responded to approximately 4–8 weeks of supportive psychotherapy, or who from the outset exhibit moderate to severe, comorbid, or
recurrent depression or suicidality, or who have a history of mania,
traumatic exposures, or severe family dysfunction or psychopathology,

Chapter 39 u Mood Disorders
assessment and treatment by a child-­trained mental health clinician
should be obtained.
For moderate to severe depression, specific manualized psychotherapies, antidepressant medication, or a combination of both should be
considered. There is insufficient evidence on which to base definitive
conclusions about the relative effectiveness of these treatments.

Psychotherapies

Clinical trials of acute treatments have generated support for the efficacy of cognitive-­
behavioral therapy (CBT)/behavioral activation
therapy and interpersonal therapy as monotherapies in depressed
youth, but overall effect sizes are modest. CBT focuses on identifying
and correcting cognitive distortions that may lead to depressed mood
and teaches problem-­solving, behavior activation, social communication, and emotional regulation skills to combat depression. Interpersonal therapy focuses on enhancing interpersonal problem solving
and social communication to decrease interpersonal conflicts. Each of
these therapies typically involves 8-­12 weekly visits. Limited evidence
suggests that family therapy may be more effective than no treatment
in decreasing depression and improving family functioning. Manualized CBT treatment as well as alternative therapy modalities such as
play therapy are also available for younger children.

Pharmacologic Treatment

Two selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), fluoxetine and
escitalopram, are the only antidepressants approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of depression in
youth; fluoxetine alone is approved for preadolescents. Other SSRIs,
with the exception of paroxetine, which has been shown to be ineffective in children, are frequently used off-­label and may be considered for
use in depressed children and teens despite the lack of FDA approval.
There are several considerations to keep in mind when starting an
SSRI, including family history of response to SSRIs, comorbid medical
conditions, and other concurrent medications. Fluoxetine should be
given in the morning, given its propensity to be activating for some
patients; escitalopram is preferentially dosed in the evening as it can
be sedating. Sertraline has the advantage of a very wide dosing range,
which can be helpful when small dosing changes are preferred.
All SSRIs carry a “black box” warning for increased suicidal thinking
in patients under age 25 that must be discussed with all patients and
caregivers before starting an SSRI. The risk for this side effect is highest when initiating treatment and when making dose adjustments. All
SSRIs can cause akathisia, an uncomfortable feeling of internal restlessness; this side effect is more common in children than it is in adults.
Gastrointestinal upset and headaches are among the most common side
effects; they typically self-­resolve after a few weeks. However, they may
recur when dose increases are made. Education around the expected
course and resolution of these side effects can be helpful when providing informed consent and may lead to improved adherence in the early
phase of treatment. Sexual side effects of SSRIs, including decreased
libido and difficulty reaching orgasm, are also important considerations
and should be addressed with patients before treatment initiation.
If the first trial of an SSRI is unsuccessful, a trial of a second SSRI
should be considered. An adequate trial of an SSRI requires that a sufficient dose be achieved and that it be continued for a reasonable amount
of time. Given the length of time it takes for SSRIs to take full effect, an
adequate trial would be at least 6-­8 weeks at a target dose. Trials may
end early if patients experience intolerable side effects. For patients
who do not respond to two adequate trials of an SSRI, it is appropriate
to consider referral to a psychiatrist for further management.
Clinical severity, comorbidity, family conflict, low drug concentration, nonadherence, anhedonia, sleep difficulties, subsyndromal manic
symptoms, and child maltreatment have all been related to treatment
resistance. Approximately 50% of depressed youth failing to respond to
the first SSRI respond after switching to a second antidepressant plus
CBT, vs approximately 40% who respond to a second medication alone.
For youth with psychotic depression, augmenting the antidepressant
with an atypical antipsychotic medication should be considered, while
monitoring closely for side effects.

259

Because of the high rate of recurrence, successful treatment should
continue for 6-­12 months. The findings from one trial suggested that
the addition of relapse-­prevention CBT to ongoing medication management reduces the risk of relapse more than medication management
alone, even after the end of treatment. When treatment concludes, all
antidepressants (except possibly fluoxetine because of its long half-­life)
should be discontinued gradually to avoid withdrawal symptoms (gastrointestinal upset, disequilibrium, sleep disruption, flulike symptoms,
sensory disturbances). Patients with recurrent (two or more episodes),
chronic, or severe major depression may require treatment beyond 12
months.
Ketamine or esketamine, glutamatergic N-­methyl-­d-­aspartate
(NMDA) receptor antagonists have demonstrated efficacy in treating
treatment resistant depression in adults.
There are no rigorous studies evaluating the effectiveness of pharmacologic or psychosocial treatment approaches to persistent depressive disorder or DMDD. The aforementioned treatments for MDD may
prove helpful in persistent depressive disorder. In suspected cases of
DMDD, child and adolescent psychiatry consultation may be helpful
to clarify diagnosis and suggest treatment approaches.

LEVEL OF CARE

Most children and adolescents with mild to moderate depressive disorders can be safely and effectively treated as outpatients, provided that
a clinically appropriate schedule of visits can be maintained through
the phases of treatment. Inpatient treatment should be considered for
youth who present with a substantial risk of suicide, serious self-­harm,
or self-­neglect, or when the family is not able to provide an appropriate level of supervision or follow-­up with outpatient treatment recommendations, or when comprehensive assessment for diagnostic clarity
is needed. When considering inpatient admission for a young person
with depression, the benefits of inpatient treatment need to be balanced against potential detrimental effects, such as separation from
family and community support.

CLINICAL COURSE

Major depression may first appear at any age, but the likelihood of
onset greatly increases with puberty. Incidence appears to peak in the
20s. The median duration of a major depressive episode is about 5-­8
months for clinically referred youth and 3-­6 months for community
samples. The course is quite variable in that some individuals rarely
or never experience remission, whereas others experience many years
with few or no symptoms between episodes. Persistent depressive
disorder often has an early and insidious onset and, by definition, a
chronic course (average untreated duration in both clinical and community samples: 3.5 years).
Depressed children appear to be more likely to develop nondepressive psychiatric disorders in adulthood than depressive disorders.
However, depression in adolescents has a probability of recurrence
reaching 50–70% after 5 years. The persistence of even mild depressive symptoms during remission is a powerful predictor of recurrence;
other negative prognostic factors include more severe symptoms, longer time to remission, history of maltreatment, and comorbid psychiatric disorders. Up to 20% of depressed adolescents develop a bipolar
disorder; the risk is higher among adolescents who have a high genetic
risk for bipolar disorder, who have psychotic depression, or who have
had pharmacologically induced mania.

SEQUELAE

Approximately 60% of youths with MDD report thinking about suicide;
30% attempt suicide. Youths with depressive disorders are also at high
risk of substance abuse, impaired family and peer relationships, early
pregnancy, legal problems, educational and occupational underachievement, and poor adjustment to life stressors, including physical illness.
Children with DMDD have displayed elevated rates of social impairments, school suspension, and service use. Irritability in adolescence
has predicted the development of major depressive and dysthymic disorders and generalized anxiety disorder (but not bipolar disorder) 20
years later, as well as lower educational attainment and income.

260 Part III u Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders
PREVENTION

Experimental trials have sought to demonstrate the effectiveness of
psychologic or educational strategies in preventing the onset of depressive disorders in children and adolescents. These programs generally
have provided information about the link between depressed mood,
thoughts, and behaviors, as well as training in skills intended to modify
these thoughts and behaviors. A Cochrane review found small effects
of these programs on depression symptoms when implemented universally vs no intervention, with selective programs targeted at high-­risk
groups performing better than universal programs; however, the effect
of prevention programs was null compared with attention controls.

39.2 Bipolar Disorders
Colleen K. Manak and Rosa K. Kim
The bipolar and related disorders include bipolar I, bipolar II, cyclothymic, and other specified/unspecified bipolar and related disorders,
as well as bipolar and related disorder caused by another medical
condition.
A manic episode is characterized by a distinct period of at least 1
week in which there is an abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased goal-­
directed activity or energy that is present for most of the day, nearly
every day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary). The episode
is associated with characteristic cognitive and behavioral symptoms,
including disturbances in self-­regard, speech, attention, thought, activity, impulsivity, and sleep (Table 39.6). To diagnose bipolar I disorder,
criteria must be met for at least one manic episode, and the episode
must not be better explained by a psychotic disorder. The manic episode may be preceded and may be followed by hypomanic or major
depressive episodes. Bipolar I disorder is rated as mild, moderate, or
severe in the same way as the depressive disorders.
To diagnose bipolar II disorder, criteria must be met for at least
one hypomanic episode and at least one major depressive episode. A
hypomanic episode is similar to a manic episode but is briefer (at
least 4 days) and less severe (causes less impairment in functioning,
is not associated with psychosis, and would not require hospitalization) (Table 39.7). In bipolar II disorder, there must never have been
a manic disorder, the episodes must not be better explained by a psychotic disorder, and the symptoms of depression or the unpredictability caused by frequent alternation between periods of depression
and hypomania must cause clinically significant distress or functional
impairment. Bipolar II disorder is also rated as mild, moderate, or
severe.
Cyclothymic disorder is characterized by a period of at least 1 year
(in children and adolescents) in which there are numerous periods
with hypomanic and depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria
for a hypomanic episode or a major depressive episode, respectively
(Table 39.8).

EPIDEMIOLOGY

The lifetime prevalence of bipolar disorder I among adults in the
United States varies from 0.8–1.6%, and bipolar II carries a lifetime
prevalence of around 1.1%. Bipolar I disorder affects males and females
equally, whereas bipolar II disorder is more common in females. Lifetime rates of mania among youth have ranged from 0.1–1.7%. The
estimated annual number of U.S. office-­based visits of youth with a
diagnosis of bipolar disorder increased from 25 per 100,000 population
in 1994-­1995 to 1,003/100,000 in 2002-­2003. U.S. hospital discharge
diagnoses increased from 1.4 to 7.3/10,000 in 9-13-­year-­old children
and from 5.1 to 20.4 per 10,000 in 14-­19 year olds. These increases
were not found in U.K. diagnoses or hospital discharges, raising questions about whether bipolar disorder was being over-­diagnosed in the

Table 39.6  DSM-­5 Diagnostic Criteria for a Manic Episode
A.	A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated,
expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently
increased goal-­directed activity or energy, lasting at least 1 wk
and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if
hospitalization is necessary).
B.	During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy
or activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the
mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and
represent a noticeable change from usual behavior:
1.	Inflated self-­esteem or grandiosity.
2.	Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hr of
sleep).
3.	More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.
4.	Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are
racing.
5.	Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or
irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed.
6.	Increase in goal-­directed activity (either socially, at work or
school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposeless
non–goal-­directed activity).
7.	Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential
for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained
buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business
investments).
C.	The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked
impairment in social or occupational functioning or to necessitate
hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others, or there are
psychotic features.
D.	The episode is not attributable to the physiologic effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment)
or to another medical condition.
Note: A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant
treatment (e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists
at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiologic effect of that
treatment is sufficient evidence for a manic episode and, therefore,
a bipolar I diagnosis.
Note: Criteria A-­D constitute a manic episode. At least one lifetime
manic episode is required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.

United States, with resultant increases in prescribing of antipsychotic
and mood-­stabilizing medications.

ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS

Twin studies suggest the heritability of bipolar disorder may be
60–90%; shared and unique environmental factors may account for
30–40% and 10–20%, respectively. Offspring of parents with bipolar
disorders are at high risk for early-­onset bipolar disorders as well as
anxiety and behavioral disorders and mood dysregulation. There is an
average 10-­fold increased risk among adult relatives of individuals with
bipolar disorder, with the magnitude of risk increasing with the degree
of kinship. Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia likely share a common
genetic origin, reflected in familial co-­aggregation of the two disorders.
Studies to date suggest key roles for the amygdala, anterior paralimbic cortices, and their connections in the emotional dysregulation of
bipolar disorder. Some of these abnormalities are apparent by adolescence, whereas others appear to progress over adolescence into young
adulthood.
Dysthymic (sad), cyclothymic (labile), or hyperthymic (irritable) temperaments may presage eventual bipolar disorder. Premorbid anxiety
and dysphoria also are common. Environmental factors such as irritable and negative parenting styles, physical and sexual abuse, poor
social support, and prenatal alcohol exposure may interact with genetic
vulnerability to produce early onset of bipolar illness as well as negative
prognostic indicators. Affective lability, in particular, has been associated with high levels of childhood trauma, and gradual sensitization to
stressors has been linked to episode recurrence.

parent-­completed versions of mania-­specific rating scales (e.g., General Behavior Inventory, Child Mania Rating Scale, Young Mania Rating
Scale) have been associated with increased likelihood of a bipolar diagnosis. However, screening tools for bipolar disorder have suboptimal
psychometric properties when applied to young people. Because of the
complexity of diagnosing and treating bipolar disorders, any suspected
cases should be referred to the specialty mental health setting for comprehensive assessment and treatment.

PRESENTATION

In adolescents, the clinical manifestations of mania are similar to those
in adults; psychosis (delusions, hallucinations) often is an associated
symptom (see Chapter 47). Mood in a manic episode is often described
as euphoric, excessively cheerful, high, or “feeling on top of the world.”
During the episode, the adolescent may engage in multiple new projects that are initiated with little knowledge of the topic and often at
unusual hours (middle of the night). Inflated self-­esteem is usually
present, ranging from uncritical self-­confidence to marked grandiosity,
and may reach delusional proportions. The adolescent may sleep little,
if at all, for days and still feel rested and full of energy. Speech can be
rapid, pressured, and loud and characterized by jokes, puns, amusing
irrelevancies, and theatricality. Frequently there is a “flight of ideas,”
evidenced by an almost continuous flow of accelerated speech, with
abrupt shifts from one topic to another. Distractibility is evidenced by
an inability to censor irrelevant extraneous stimuli, which often prevents an individual with mania from engaging in a rational conversation. The expansive mood, grandiosity, and poor judgment often lead
to reckless involvement in activities with high potential for personal
harm.
Controversy surrounds the applicability of the diagnostic criteria for
mania to prepubertal children. It may be developmentally normal for
children to be elated, expansive, grandiose, or talkative, reducing the
specificity of these symptoms to this disorder. In addition, the distractibility, overactivity, impulsivity, and irritability formerly ascribed to
bipolar disorder by some investigators may be better explained by a
diagnosis of ADHD, with or without comorbid ODD. The presentation
of severe and pervasive irritability formerly diagnosed as “bipolar disorder” may be better captured by the diagnosis of DMDD.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

Numerous psychiatric disorders, general medical conditions, and
medications can generate manic-­like symptoms and must be distinguished from the bipolar and related disorders. The psychiatric disorders include ADHD, ODD, and intermittent explosive, posttraumatic
stress, depressive, anxiety, substance abuse, and borderline personality
disorders. Medical conditions include neurologic disorders, endocrine
disorders, infectious diseases, tumors, anemia, uremia, and vitamin
deficiencies. Medications include androgens, bronchodilators, cardiovascular medications, corticosteroids, chemotherapy agents, thyroid
preparations, and certain psychiatric medications (benzodiazepines,
antidepressants, stimulants). The diagnosis of a bipolar disorder should
be made after these other explanations for the observed symptoms
have been ruled out. Substance-­induced mood disorder should also be
considered and ruled out in patients presenting with mania.

262 Part III u Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders
For bipolar II disorder, the main differential is unipolar depression
(MDD) or cyclothymic disorder, which are ruled out by the lack of a
hypomanic episode and by not meeting full criteria for either a major
depressive or hypomanic episode, respectively.

COMORBIDITY

The most common simultaneous comorbidities (ADHD, ODD,
conduct disorder, anxiety) may be difficult to distinguish from
mania because of considerable symptom overlap. Substance use
also is a common comorbidity in adolescents, and presentations
that appear to be manic may remit when the substances of abuse
are discontinued.

TREATMENT
Pharmacologic Treatment

Medication is the primary treatment for mania (Table 39.9). Studies
have demonstrated the superiority of antipsychotics over mood stabilizers in the treatment of mania. Risperidone and olanzapine are the
most efficacious agents; quetiapine, risperidone, and olanzapine ranked
as the most tolerable agents. The choice of antipsychotic medication is
based on factors such as side effect profiles, comorbidities, adherence,
and positive response of a family member.
Among traditional mood stabilizers, only lithium is FDA approved
for the treatment of bipolar disorder from age 12 years; its efficacy
and tolerability compared to placebo has been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). There also is evidence that lithium
reduces the risk of suicide and total deaths in patients with both unipolar and bipolar depressive disorder.
Given the co-­occurrence of sleep disturbance with bipolar disorders,
the use of medications to help regulate sleep can have a significant benefit on mood and functioning. Medications to promote sleep, including benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine receptor agonists, and melatonin
receptor agonists have some evidence for the treatment of sleep in
bipolar disorder in adults. When treating children and adolescents, it
is important to monitor for paradoxical activation/disinhibition when
using benzodiazepines.
Medication trials should be systematic and their duration sufficient
(generally 6-­8 weeks) to determine effectiveness. Care should be taken
to avoid unnecessary polypharmacy, in part by discontinuing agents
that have not demonstrated significant benefit. Because these medications are associated with significant side effects, careful monitoring of
baseline and follow-­up indices is imperative (see Chapter 33).
The regimen needed to stabilize acute mania should be maintained
for 12-­24 months. Maintenance therapy is often needed for adolescents
with bipolar I disorder, and some patients need lifelong medication.
Any attempts to discontinue prophylactic medication should be done
gradually while closely monitoring the patient for relapse.
Antidepressants alone should not be prescribed for depressive symptoms in confirmed cases of bipolar I disorder because of the risk of
manic switch. For treatment of depression in bipolar II, antidepressant

medication may be used cautiously. Comorbid ADHD can be treated

Psychotherapies

Psychotherapy is a potentially important adjunctive treatment for
bipolar disorders. Therapies with some evidence of efficacy, primarily
as adjunctive to pharmacotherapy, include multifamily psychoeducational psychotherapy and family-­focused treatment, child and family–­
focused CBT, dialectical behavioral therapy, and interpersonal and
social rhythm therapy. Active components of these therapies include
family involvement and psychoeducation, along with self-­regulation,
cognitive restructuring, communication, problem-­solving, and emotion regulation skills. Factors that adversely influence response to therapy include high-­conflict families and sleep impairment, suggesting
the importance of targeting these factors in treatment. Sleep hygiene is
an important factor in the treatment of mania, and there is support for
the use of CBT in treating insomnia related to bipolar disorder. Ensuring patients get adequate rest will help with recovery and the prevention of future episodes of mania.

LEVEL OF CARE

Most youths with bipolar disorders can be safely and effectively treated
as outpatients, provided that an appropriate schedule of visits and laboratory monitoring can be maintained through the course of treatment.
Youths who are suicidal, homicidal, psychotic, or present an intentional danger to themselves or others typically require inpatient care.

Clinical Course and Prognosis

The mean age of onset of the first manic episode is approximately 18
years old for bipolar I disorder. Premorbid problems are common in
bipolar disorder, especially temperamental difficulties with mood and
behavioral regulation. Premorbid anxiety also is common. The early
course of adolescent-­onset bipolar I disorder appears to be more
chronic and refractory to treatment than adult-­onset bipolar disorder.
Comorbidity predicts functional impairment, and age at onset predicts duration of episodes. Sleep impairment and family conflict are
inversely related to favorable treatment response, suggesting important targets for treatment. The bipolar disorders are highly recurrent,
and 70–80% of bipolar I patients will have additional mood episodes.
Recurrent episodes can approximate 4 in 10 years, with the inter-­
episode interval shortening as the patient ages. Although the majority
of patients with bipolar I return to a fully functional level between episodes, approximately 30% continue to be symptomatic and functionally impaired between episodes.
The initial presentation of bipolar I disorder is often a major depressive episode. Switching from a depressive episode to a manic episode
by adulthood may occur in 10–20% of youth, both spontaneously and
during depression treatment. Factors that predict the eventual development of mania in depressed youth include a depressive episode
characterized by rapid onset, psychomotor retardation, and psychotic
features; a family history of affective disorders, especially bipolar disorder; and a history of mania or hypomania after antidepressant therapy.
The mean age of onset of bipolar II disorder is 20 years old. The illness most often begins with a depressive episode and is not recognized
as bipolar II disorder until a hypomanic episode occurs, in about 12%
of individuals with the initial diagnosis of major depression. Many
individuals experience several episodes of major depression before
experiencing the first recognized hypomanic episode. Anxiety, substance misuse, or eating disorders may also precede the onset of bipolar
II, complicating its detection. About 5–15% of individuals with bipolar
II disorder will ultimately develop a manic episode, which changes the
diagnosis to bipolar I disorder.
Depression in bipolar I or II usually has an earlier age of onset, more
frequent episodes of shorter duration, an abrupt onset and offset, is
linked to comorbid substance misuse, and is triggered by stressors.
Atypical symptoms such as hypersomnia, lability, and weight instability are also common in bipolar depression, reported in up to 90% of
cases vs 50% in unipolar depression. Psychosis, psychomotor retardation, and catatonia are also more characteristic of bipolar depression,

whereas somatic complaints are more frequent in unipolar depression.
A family history of mania is also a relevant discriminating factor.
Provision of clinical services is poor for youth with bipolar disorder. In one healthcare system study spanning 2-­year follow-­up after
diagnosis, despite complex drug regimens, medication appointments
were infrequent, averaging one visit every 2 months. More than 50%
of patients needed one or more hospitalizations, and almost half had
psychiatric emergency department visits. In a national study, 38% of
youths diagnosed with bipolar disorder had received no treatment
at all.

EPIDEMIOLOGY

SEQUELAE

More than 30% of 9th-­12th grade students in the United States felt so
sad or hopeless almost every day for 2 or more weeks in a row during the previous year that they stopped doing usual activities. During
that same period, 18.8% of the students reported that they had seriously considered attempting suicide, and 8.9% reported that they had
attempted suicide one or more times. A suicide attempt in the previous year that resulted in an injury, poisoning, or overdose that had to
be treated by a physician or nurse was reported by 2.5% of students.
Ingestion is the most common method of attempted suicide. The
15–19-­year-­old age-­group is the most likely to intentionally harm themselves by ingestion, receive treatment in the ED, and survive. Attempts are
more common in adolescent females than males and in Hispanic females
than their non-­Hispanic counterparts. LGBTQ+ and bullied youths also
have disproportionately high rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts
(see Chapter 154). Prior self-­harm (self-­injury) from poisoning, drowning,
firearms, fires, asphyxiation (hanging), and traffic injury are risk factors
for suicide. Repeated episodes of self-­harm are a higher risk factor than a
single episode (see Chapter 46). Attempters who have made prior suicide
attempts, who used a method other than ingestion, who have a plan, who
have no regret, and who still want to die are at increased risk for completed
suicide. Nonetheless, a significant number of children and adolescents
who have completed suicide had no previous attempts.

Bipolar disorder has one of the higher rates of suicide among mental health diagnoses, with a lifetime risk of suicide in individuals with
bipolar disorder estimated to be at least 15 times that of the general
population. Factors associated with suicide attempts include female
gender, young age at illness onset, depressive polarity of first illness
episode or current or most recent episode, comorbid anxiety disorder,
any comorbid substance use disorder, borderline personality disorder,
and first-­degree family history of suicide. In contrast, completed suicides are associated with male sex and a first-­degree family history of
suicide. Despite patients with bipolar disorder having normal or even
superior cognition before diagnosis, bipolar disorder has been associated with decrements in executive function and verbal memory. Youths
with bipolar disorder are also at high risk for substance abuse, antisocial behavior, impaired academic performance, impaired family and
peer relationships, and poor adjustment to life stressors.

PREVENTION

Although empirical support is sparse, one study demonstrated the
effectiveness of family-­focused treatment vs an educational control in
hastening and sustaining recovery from mood symptoms in a high-­
familial-­risk cohort of youths with subsyndromal symptoms of mania.
Family-­focused treatment is a manualized psychoeducational intervention designed to reduce family stress, conflict, and affective arousal
by enhancing communication and problem solving between youths
and their caregivers. Pharmacologic interventions for subsyndromal
mania have produced equivocal results.

Chapter 40

Suicide and Attempted
Suicide
Jennifer A. Zaspel and Rosa K. Kim
Youth suicide is a major public health concern. In 2021, suicide was the
second leading cause of death in adolescents and young adults (aged
10-­24 years) and the tenth leading cause of death for all ages. The rates
of emergency department (ED) visits for psychiatric chief complaints
have also increased over time, with a 2.5-­fold increase in suicide-­
related visits in adolescents. There are numerous genetic, psychiatric,
social, cultural, and environmental risk factors for suicidal behavior
(Fig. 40.1). There are also many protective factors and interventions
that can reduce rates of self-­injury and suicide. Knowledge of these risk
factors and protective factors may facilitate identification and treatment in youths at highest risk for intentional harm to themselves.

Suicide rates for children and adolescents have been increasing over
time, with the overall suicide rates increasing by 35% since 1999. It is
estimated that 46% of people who die by suicide were diagnosed with a
psychiatric condition at the time of their death. Linear trends in suicide
attempts from 2009–2019 have also increased and specifically among
certain demographic groups. A better understanding of which groups
are at risk for suicide and parasuicidal behavior can help pediatricians
identify and support those who are at risk (Table 40.1).

Suicidal Ideation and Attempts

Suicide Completions

In the United States, completed suicide is very rare before age 10.
Rates of completed suicide increase steadily across adolescence into
young adulthood, peaking in the early 20s. The male-­to-­female ratio
for completed suicide rises with age from 3:1 in children to approximately 4:1 in those aged 15-­24 and greater than 6:1 among those ages
20-­24. Although exact rates have changed over time, firearms, suffocation, and poisoning remain the most common methods of suicide
(Fig. 40.2).
For both male and female youth ages 15-­24, suicide rates remain
highest among Indigenous American and Indigenous Alaskan youth
and White youth relative to Black, Asian or Pacific Islander, and Hispanic youth. However, rates have been rising for both Black and Asian
or Pacific Islander youth, with the rates in Black males increasing
47% between 2013 and 2019 (12.2/100,000 to 17.9/100,000 individuals) and Asian or Pacific Islander males increasing 40% between 2013
and 2019 (12.0/100,000 to 16.8/100,000 individuals). Similar increases
have also been seen in female youth in these groups in this time, with
a rate increase of 59% among Black female youth (2.7 to 4.3/100,000)
and 42% among Asian or Pacific Islander (3.6 to 5.1/100,000). In 2021,
the combined (male and female, age 10-24) suicide rates among Indigenous youths increased ~16% (over 2018 rates); Increases were also
noted among Black youths (~36%) and Hispanic youths (~8%).

RISK FACTORS

Multiple risk factors predispose youth to suicide (see Fig. 40.1, Table
40.1). Dynamic risk factors are those that change over time and are
most amenable to risk mitigation through treatment, resources, and
support. Static risk factors are those that increase an individual’s risk of
suicide attempt and completion but are not amenable to direct intervention. They include genetic factors, demographic information, an
individual’s past psychiatric history, family psychiatric history, and
history of suicidal and parasuicidal behavior. The risk associated with
each factor varies, with the highest risk associated with a personal

history of a suicide attempt. Risk is also cumulative, with childhood
adversity leading to an increased lifetime risk of suicide.

Access to Firearms

Firearms are the most lethal method of suicide completion; the death
rate with respect to firearms is approximately 80–90%, whereas the
death rate is only 1.5–4% for drug overdoses. Firearms have long been
the most common method of completed suicide across all ages and
genders and have become the most common method of suicide completion for adolescent males (see Fig. 40.2). Limiting access to lethal
means, in particular firearms, reduces rates of completed suicide.

Suicide Contagion

Suicide attempts may also be precipitated by exposure to news of
another person’s suicide or by reading about or viewing a suicide portrayed in a romantic light in the media. Media coverage of suicide is
linked to fluctuating incidence rates of suicides, particularly among
adolescents. Glorification of suicide whether in news or in fictional
media has been associated with an increase in suicides. When media
coverage includes a detailed description of specific means used, the use
of that particular method may increase in the overall population.

Preexisting Psychiatric Illness

Approximately 90% of youths who complete suicide have a preexisting psychiatric illness, most often major depression. Among females,
chronic anxiety, especially panic disorder, also is associated with suicide attempts and completion. Among males, conduct disorder and
substance use confer increased risk. Comorbidity of a substance use
disorder, a depressive disorder, and/or conduct disorder are linked to
suicide by firearm. Schizophrenia spectrum disorders are linked to suicide attempts and completions (see Chapter 47.1).

Suicidal and Parasuicidal Behavior

History of a previous suicide attempt is recognized as the strongest predictive risk factor for future suicidal behavior. Individual definitions
of suicide attempts can vary; therefore parasuicidal behavior should
be explored when considering past attempts. Some patients may not
consider an aborted attempt or interrupted attempt an actual suicide
attempt, but these behaviors carry considerable risk, as do researching

of the association between each

suicide methods, preparatory acts, rehearsals, giving away possessions,
and making arrangements for responsibilities (e.g., finding someone
else to care for a pet or family member in their planned absence).
Nonsuicidal self-­injury (NSSI) is the direct and deliberate destruction of one’s own body tissue with the absence of intent to die (see Chapter 46). The most common self-­harm behavior is cutting or carving, but
other behaviors include scratching, burning, punching or hitting oneself, biting, and others. NSSI is common among adolescents, especially
females. Up to 47.4% of youth with a diagnosis of depression engage in
NSSI, and lifetime prevalence rates of NSSI are between 17% and 60%.
Although the intent of these behaviors may not be to cause death, they
are important to note, as they are strong predictors of future suicidality
if left untreated. Seventy percent of adolescents who engaged in NSSI
report a lifetime suicide attempt, and 55% reported multiple attempts.
Individuals who are most likely to engage in NSSI are those who have
a family member or close friend who have engaged in self-­harm and
those who believe that peers engage in self-­harm.

Protective Factors

Protective factors (Table 40.2) can provide a counterbalance for those
contemplating suicide. Internal protective factors are those that are
inherent to the individual. External protective factors are typically
dependent on relationships and interactions with others. Protective
factors, even if present, may not counteract significant acute risk.

ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENTION

All suicidal ideation (including planning) and suicide attempts should
be taken seriously and require a thorough assessment by a child-­trained
mental health clinician to evaluate the youth’s current state of mind,
ongoing risk of harm, and next best steps in treatment. Emergency
mental health assessment is needed for immediate threat to self (i.e.,
active suicidal ideation with plan and intent); urgent mental health
assessment (48-­72 hours) is needed for severe psychiatric symptoms,
significant change in overall functioning, and suicidal ideation without intent or plan. Routine mental health assessment is appropriate for
mild to moderate psychiatric symptoms without suicidal ideation.
Pediatric practitioners should expect the mental health clinician to
evaluate the presence and degree of suicidality and underlying risk factors. The reliability and validity of child interviewing are affected by

children’s level of cognitive development as well as their understanding
of the relationship between their emotions and behavior. Confirmation of the youth’s suicidal behavior can be obtained from information
gathered by interviewing others who know the child or adolescent. A
discrepancy between patient and parent reports is not unusual, with
both children and adolescents more likely to disclose suicidal ideation
and suicidal actions than their parents.

Suicide Inquiry

In the mental health assessment, suicidal ideation is assessed by
explicit questions posed in a nonjudgmental, noncondescending,
matter-­of-­fact approach. The clinician should explore all aspects of

265

suicidal ideation (i.e., frequency, intensity), suicide plan, parasuicidal
behaviors like preparatory acts or writing notes, and intent associated
with their thoughts. The assessment of a suicide attempt should also
include a detailed exploration of the hours immediately preceding an
attempt to identify precipitants as well as the circumstances of the
attempt itself to better understand the patient’s intent and potential
lethality. It is important to recognize that suicidal ideation is dynamic
in nature and should be considered on an individual basis; a patient
should be compared to their own baseline when assessing for risk of
harm to self.

Children Under 12 Years

Although suicidal ideation and attempts are less frequent in children
under 12 than older teens and adults, they do occur. A developmental approach must be taken, as children vary in their understanding
of death, moral reasoning, and cognitive reasoning based on age and
whether they are following a typical developmental trajectory. A young
child may not recognize that their means are not lethal, but that fact
should not discount their intent.
Unlike adolescents, Black male children are most likely to complete
suicide, most often by hanging or strangulation. Children who are
at risk of suicide may be less likely to demonstrate classical symptoms of depression than teens and are more likely to attempt at home.
Children who die by suicide have higher rates of attention-­deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), emphasizing the importance of
impulsivity in suicide attempts. Relationship problems are the most
common precipitating circumstance, but the specific relationship differs along developmental lines. Younger adolescents are more likely
to have had relationship problems with peers or a significant other,
whereas children are more likely to have had relationship problems
with family.

Determining Risk

The calculation of the level of risk of harm to self is complex, requiring
a determination across a spectrum of risk. At the low end of the risk
spectrum are youth with thoughts of death or wanting to die but without suicidal thoughts, intent, or plan. Those with specific suicide plans,
preparatory acts or suicide rehearsals, low probability of being found
during an attempt, and clearly articulated intent are at the high end.
A history of suicide attempts, presently impaired judgment, and poor
social support further exacerbates the heightened risk. Among adolescents who consider self-­harm, those who carry out self-­injury are more
likely to have family or friends who have engaged in self-­harm. When
considering all aspects of a suicide risk assessment, positive responses
to a suicide inquiry carry more weight and concern than risk factors
alone.

Levels of Psychiatric Care

For youth who are an imminent danger to themselves (i.e., have active
thoughts of killing themselves with plan and intent), inpatient level of
psychiatric care is necessary to ensure safety, clarify diagnoses, and
plan comprehensive treatment. These patients can be hospitalized
voluntarily or involuntarily. It is helpful for the pediatric practitioner
to have an office protocol to follow in these situations. This protocol
should take into consideration state laws regarding involuntary hospitalization, transportation options, nearest emergency assessment site,
necessary forms for hospitalization, and available emergency mental
health consultants.
For those youth suitable for treatment in the outpatient setting
(e.g., suicidal ideation without plan or intent, intact mental status, few or no other risk factors for suicidality, willing and able to
participate in outpatient treatment; has caregivers able to provide
emotional support, supervision, safeguarding, and adherence to
follow-­up), an appointment should be scheduled within a few days
with a mental health clinician. Ideally, this appointment should be
scheduled before leaving the assessment venue. A procedure should
be in place to contact the family to encourage mental health follow­up and provide additional support or resources, if needed. Some

evidence suggests that quick and consistent follow-­up with a team
approach, including both primary care and mental health, can be
helpful in enhancing treatment plan engagement among patients
who are suicidal.

Safety Planning

Safety planning is a brief psychosocial intervention that has been
shown to reduce suicidal behavior and increase engagement in treatment. Safety plan development consists of working ideally with both
the patient and their caregivers to identify individual warning signs
and symptoms related to self-­harm and suicidal behavior, outlining
healthy coping skills and people or places that can provide distraction,
identifying loved ones and professionals who can be contacted during a crisis, and agreeing on ways to make the home environment safe
(e.g., removing firearms, locking up medications). Studies have repeatedly refuted the efficacy of safety or suicide contracts in mitigating risk
of completing suicide, and some have shown them to be harmful to the
therapeutic relationship.

PREVENTION

The previously mentioned risk factors associated with suicide are
relatively common and individually not strong predictors of suicide. The assessment is complicated by patients who may attempt
to conceal their suicide thoughts and by those who express suicidal thoughts without serious intent. Suicide screening has been
challenging because most screening instruments have variable
sensitivity and specificity. In addition, the follow-­up mental health
evaluations for those who screen positive has been poor.
Prevention strategies in the pediatric medical home include
training staff to recognize and respond to the warning signs of suicide (Table 40.3), screening for and treating depression, educating

patients/parents about warning signs for suicide, and restricting
access to lethal means. Pediatric practitioners should consider
counseling parents to remove firearms from the home entirely or
securely lock guns and ammunition in separate locations. Anecdotal evidence suggests youths frequently know where guns and
keys to gun cabinets are kept, even though parents may think they
do not. The same recommendation applies to restricting access to
potentially lethal prescription and nonprescription medications
(e.g., containers of >25 acetaminophen tablets) and alcohol. These
approaches emphasize the importance of restriction of access to
means of suicide to prevent self-­harm.

SCREENING AND EARLY TREATMENT

In 2022, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded that there is insufficient evidence to recommend universal
suicide screening in the primary care setting for children and adolescents. The American Academy of Pediatrics does recommend
universal suicide screening for all children ≥12 years old. In addition, in 2018 the American Academy of Pediatrics and the USPFTS
(2022) recommended annual universal depression screening for
youths 12 and older, which often includes suicide screening as part
of validated tools. Pediatric practitioners should also consider suicide potential and the need for mental health assessment in the

of the normal range (e.g., Pediatric Symptom Checklist Internalizing Sub-­S cale; see Table 28.5), or self-­reported statements or

Questionnaire (ASQ) is a validated four-­item measure shown in
the ED setting to have high sensitivity and negative predictive
value in identifying youth at risk for suicide ideation and behavior
(Fig. 40.3). Other common screening tools are the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-­S SRS) Screener (Table 40.4) and the
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-­2 /PHQ-­9 ). These scales have
also been used in the emergency room setting.
Through follow-­up office visits, pediatric practitioners can help
support and facilitate the implementation of psychotherapies that
target the specific psychiatric disorders and the emotional dysphoria or behavioral dysregulation that accompany suicidal ideation or
behavior. In conjunction with a child and adolescent psychiatrist,
psychotropic medications may be used as indicated to treat underlying psychiatric disorders. Both dialectical behavioral therapy
and cognitive behavioral therapy are effective in reducing harm
but must be combined with appropriate psychopharmacology of
an underlying disorder. Pediatric practitioners also can encourage
social connectedness to peers and to community organizations, as
well as promote help-­seeking (e.g., talking to a trusted adult when
distressed) and wellness behaviors. In the event of a completed suicide, pediatricians can offer support to the family, particularly by
monitoring for pathologic bereavement responses in siblings and
parents.

SCHOOL RESOURCES

Screening for suicide in schools is also fraught with problems related
to low specificity of screening instruments, paucity of referral sites, and
variable acceptability among school administrators. Gatekeeper (e.g.,
student support personnel) training appears effective in improving
skills among school personnel and is highly acceptable to administrators but has not been shown to prevent suicide. School curricula (e.g.,
Signs of Suicide) have shown some preventive potential by teaching
students to recognize the signs of depression and suicide in themselves
and others and providing them with specific action steps necessary for
responding to these signs. Peer helpers have not generally been shown
to be efficacious.

Eating Disorders
Taylor B. Starr and Richard E. Kreipe
Eating disorders (EDs) are characterized by body dissatisfaction
related to overvaluation of a thin body ideal, associated with dysfunctional patterns of cognition and weight control behaviors that result
in significant biologic, psychologic, and social complications. EDs can
develop in individuals of any age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity,
or cultural background. Early intervention in EDs improves outcome.

DEFINITIONS

Anorexia nervosa (AN) involves significant overestimation of body
size and shape, with a relentless pursuit of thinness that, in the restrictive subtype, typically combines excessive dieting and compulsive
exercising. In the binge-­purge subtype, patients might intermittently
overeat and then attempt to rid themselves of calories by vomiting or
taking laxatives, still with a strong drive for thinness (Table 41.1).
Bulimia nervosa (BN) is characterized by episodes of eating large
amounts of food in a brief period, followed by compensatory vomiting,
laxative use, exercise, or fasting to rid the body of the effects of overeating in an effort to avoid obesity (Table 41.2).
Children and adolescents with EDs may not fulfill criteria for AN or
BN in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth
Edition (DSM-­5) and may fall into a subcategory of Other Specified
Feeding and Eating Disorders (OSFED). Youth with these subthreshold conditions merit close monitoring over time because they may be
early in the course of an illness.
Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) involves limiting
food intake based on the subjective qualities of food (e.g., appearance,
color, smell, taste, texture or consistency), fear of adverse consequences
of eating (e.g., choking, gagging or vomiting), or lack of interest in eating, but without concern about body image, weight, shape, or size.
However, significant unintended weight loss or nutritional deficiencies
and problems with social interactions can occur as a result (Table 41.3).
Binge eating disorder (BED), in which binge eating is not followed
regularly by any compensatory behaviors (vomiting, laxatives), is a
stand-­alone category in DSM-­5 but shares many features with obesity
(see Chapter 65).

A.	Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a
significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex,
developmental trajectory, and physical health. Significantly low
weight is defined as a weight that is less than minimally normal or,
for children and adolescents, less than that minimally expected.
B.	Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent
behavior that interferes with weight gain, even though at a
significantly low weight.
C.	Disturbance in the way in which one’s body weight or shape is
experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-­
evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of
the current low body weight.
Specify whether:
Restricting type (ICD-­10-­CM code F50.01): During the last 3 mo, the
individual has not engaged in recurrent episodes of binge eating
or purging behavior (i.e., self-­induced vomiting or the misuse of
laxatives, diuretics, or enemas). This subtype describes presentations
in which weight loss is accomplished primarily through dieting,
fasting, and/or excessive exercise.
Binge-­eating/purging type (ICD-­10-­CM code F50.02): During the
last 3 mo, the individual has engaged in recurrent episodes of
binge eating or purging behavior (i.e., self-­induced vomiting or the
misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas).
Specify if:
In partial remission: After full criteria for anorexia nervosa were
previously met, Criterion A (low body weight) has not been met for
a sustained period, but either Criterion B (intense fear of gaining

EPIDEMIOLOGY

The classic presentation of AN is an early to middle adolescent female
of above-­
average intelligence and socioeconomic status who is a
conflict-­avoidant, risk-­aversive perfectionist and is struggling with disturbances of anxiety and/or mood. BN tends to emerge in later adolescence, sometimes evolving from AN, and is typified by impulsivity and
features of borderline personality disorder associated with depression
and mood swings. ARFID typically presents in late childhood, is more
common in males, and more often co-­occurs with anxiety disorders
and autism spectrum disorder. The 0.5–1% and 3–5% incidence rates
among younger and older adolescent females for AN and BN, respectively, probably reflect ascertainment bias in sampling and underdiagnosis in cases not fitting the common profile. The same may be true of

Table 41.2  DSM-­5 Diagnostic Criteria for Bulimia Nervosa
A.	Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is
characterized by both of the following:
1.	Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2 hr
period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than what
most individuals would eat in a similar period of time under
similar circumstances.
2.	A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g.,
a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how
much one is eating).
B. Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent
weight gain, such as self-­induced vomiting; misuse of
laxatives, diuretics, or other medications; fasting; or excessive
exercise.
C. The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors
both occur, on average, at least once a week for 3 mo.
D. Self-­evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and
weight.
E. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of
anorexia nervosa.
Specify if:
In partial remission: After full criteria for bulimia nervosa were
previously met, some, but not all, of the criteria have been met for
a sustained period of time.
In full remission: After full criteria for bulimia nervosa were previously
met, none of the criteria has been met for a sustained period of
time.
Specify current severity:
The minimum level of severity is based on the frequency of
inappropriate compensatory behaviors (see the following). The
level of severity may be increased to reflect other symptoms and
the degree of functional disability.
Mild: An average of 1-­3 episodes of inappropriate compensatory
behaviors per week.
Moderate: An average of 4-­7 episodes of inappropriate
compensatory behaviors per week.
Severe: An average of 8-­13 episodes of inappropriate compensatory
behaviors per week.
Extreme: An average of 14 or more episodes of inappropriate
compensatory behaviors per week.

the significant gender disparity, in which female patients account for
approximately 85% of patients with diagnosed EDs.
No single factor causes the development of an ED; sociocultural
studies indicate a complex interplay of culture, ethnicity, gender, peers,
and family. The gender dimorphism is presumably related to females
having a stronger relationship between body image and self-­evaluation,
as well as the influence of the Western culture’s thin body ideal. Ethnicity appears to moderate the association between risk factors and
disordered eating, with African American and Caribbean females
reporting lower body dissatisfaction and less dieting than Hispanic
and non-­Hispanic White females. Because peer acceptance is central to
healthy adolescent growth and development, especially in early adolescence, when AN tends to have its initial prevalence peak, the potential
influence of peers on EDs is significant, as are the relationships among
peers, body image, and eating. Teasing by peers or by family members
(especially males) may be a contributing factor for overweight females.

Family influence in the development of EDs is even more complex
because of the interplay of environmental and genetic factors; shared
elements of the family environment and immutable genetic factors
account for approximately equal amounts of the variance in disordered
eating. There are associations between parents’ and children’s eating
behaviors; dieting and physical activity levels suggest parental reinforcement of body-­related societal messages. The influence of inherited
genetic factors on the emergence of EDs during adolescence is also significant, but not directly. Rather, the risk for developing an ED appears
to be mediated through a genetic predisposition to anxiety (see Chapter 38), depression (see Chapter 39), or obsessive-­compulsive traits that
may be modulated through the internal milieu of puberty. There is no
evidence to support the outdated notion that parents or family dynamics cause an ED; rather, the family dynamics may represent responses
to having a family member with a potentially life-­threatening condition. The supportive influence on recovery of parents as nurturing
caregivers cannot be overestimated.

PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS

The emergence of EDs coinciding with the processes of adolescence
(e.g., puberty, identity, autonomy, cognition) indicates the central
role of development. EDs may be viewed as a final common pathway, with a number of predisposing factors that increase the risk
of developing an ED, precipitating factors often related to developmental processes of adolescence triggering the emergence of the
ED, and perpetuating factors that cause an ED to persist. A history
of sexual trauma is more common in children with BN, and when
present with any ED makes recovery more difficult. EDs often begin
with dieting but gradually progress to unhealthy habits that lessen
the negative impact of associated psychosocial problems to which
the affected person is vulnerable because of premorbid biologic and
psychologic characteristics, family interactions, and social climate.
When persistent, the biologic effects of starvation and malnutrition
(e.g., true loss of appetite, hypothermia, gastric atony, amenorrhea,
sleep disturbance, fatigue, weakness, depression), combined with

the psychologic rewards of increased sense of mastery and reduced
emotional reactivity, actually maintain and reward pathologic ED
behaviors.
This positive reinforcement of behaviors and consequences, generally viewed by parents and others as negative, helps to explain why
persons with an ED characteristically deny that a problem exists and
resist treatment. With significantly low caloric intake, patients initially exhibit extreme irritability, but over time experience emotional
“numbness,” which reinforces continued caloric restriction. Although
noxious, purging can be reinforcing because of a reduction in anxiety triggered by overeating; purging also can result in short-­term, but
reinforcing, improvement in mood related to changes in neurotransmitters. In addition to an imbalance in neurotransmitters, most notably serotonin and dopamine, alterations in functional anatomy also
support the concept of EDs as brain disorders. The cause-­and-­effect
relationship in central nervous system (CNS) alterations in EDs is not
clear, nor is their reversibility.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Except for ARFID, in which weight loss is unintentional, a central feature of EDs is the overestimation of body size, shape, or parts (e.g.,
abdomen, thighs) leading to intentional weight control practices to
reduce weight (AN) or prevent weight gain (BN). Associated practices
include severe restriction of caloric intake and behaviors intended to
reduce the effect of calories ingested, such as compulsive exercising or
purging by inducing vomiting or taking laxatives. Eating and weight
loss habits commonly found in EDs can result in a wide range of energy
intake and output, the balance of which leads to a wide range in weight,
from extreme loss of weight in AN to fluctuation around a normal to
moderately high weight in BN. Reported eating and weight control
habits thus inform the initial primary care approach (Table 41.4).
Although weight control patterns guide the initial pediatric
approach, an assessment of common symptoms and findings on physical examination is essential to identify targets for intervention. When
reported symptoms of excessive weight loss (feeling tired and cold;
lacking energy; orthostasis; difficulty concentrating) are explicitly
linked by the clinician to their associated physical signs (hypothermia
with acrocyanosis and slow capillary refill; loss of muscle mass; bradycardia with orthostasis), it becomes more difficult for the patient to
deny that a problem exists. Furthermore, awareness that bothersome
symptoms can be eliminated by healthier eating and activity patterns
can increase a patient’s motivation to engage in treatment. Tables 41.5
and 41.6 detail common symptoms and signs that should be addressed
in a pediatric assessment of a suspected ED.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

In addition to identifying symptoms and signs that deserve targeted
intervention for patients who have an ED, a comprehensive history
and physical examination are required to rule out other conditions
in the differential diagnosis. Weight loss can occur in any condition
with increased catabolism (e.g., hyperthyroidism, malignancy, occult
chronic infection) or malabsorption (e.g., celiac disease) or in other
disorders (Addison disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, stimulant abuse),
but these illnesses are generally associated with other findings and
are not usually associated with decreased caloric intake. Patients with
inflammatory bowel disease can reduce intake to minimize abdominal cramping; eating can cause abdominal discomfort and early satiety
in AN because of gastric atony associated with significant weight loss,
not malabsorption. Likewise, signs of weight loss in AN might include
hypothermia, acrocyanosis with slow capillary refill, and neutropenia
similar to some features of sepsis, but the overall picture in EDs is one
of relative cardiovascular stability compared with sepsis. Endocrinopathies are also in the differential of EDs. With BN, voracious appetite
in the face of weight loss might suggest diabetes mellitus, but blood
glucose levels are normal or low in EDs. Adrenal insufficiency mimics many physical symptoms and signs found in restrictive AN but is
associated with elevated potassium levels and hyperpigmentation. Thyroid disorders may be considered, because of changes in weight, but the
overall presentation of AN includes symptoms of both underactive and

CLINICAL COMMENTS REGARDING ED
SYMPTOMS

SYMPTOMS

ANOREXIA NERVOSA

BULIMIA NERVOSA

Body image

Feels fat, even with extreme
emaciation, often with specific body
distortions (e.g., stomach, thighs);
strong drive for thinness, with self-­
efficacy closely tied to appraisal of
body shape, size, and/or weight

Variable body image distortion
and dissatisfaction, but drive
for thinness is less than desire
to avoid gaining weight

Challenging patient’s body image is both
ineffective and countertherapeutic clinically
Accepting patient’s expressed body image
but noting its discrepancy with symptoms
and signs reinforces concept that patient can
“feel” fat but also “be” too thin and unhealthy

Metabolism

Hypometabolic symptoms include
feeling cold, tired, and weak and
lacking energy
May be both bothersome and
reinforcing

Variable, depending on balance
of intake and output and
hydration

Symptoms are evidence of body’s “shutting
down” in an attempt to conserve calories with
an inadequate diet
Emphasizing reversibility of symptoms with
healthy eating and weight gain can motivate
patients to cooperate with treatment

Skin

Dry skin, delayed healing, easy
bruising, gooseflesh
Orange-­yellow skin on hands

No characteristic symptom;
self-­injurious behavior may
be seen

hair

Body hair growth conserves energy
Scalp hair loss can worsen during refeeding
“telogen effluvium” (resting hair is replaced by
growing hair)
Reversible with continued healthy eating

Eyes

No characteristic symptom

Subconjunctival hemorrhage

Caused by increased intrathoracic pressure
during vomiting

purge subtype

Dizziness, fainting, palpitations

Dizziness and fainting due to postural ortho­
static tachycardia and dysregulation at
hypothalamic and cardiac level with weight
loss, as a result of hypovolemia with binge-­purge
Palpitations and arrhythmias often caused by
electrolyte disturbance
Symptoms reverse with weight gain and/or
cessation of binge-­purge

Abdomen

Early fullness and discomfort with
eating
Constipation
Perceives contour as “fat,” often
preferring well-­defined abdominal
musculature

Discomfort after a binge
Cramps and diarrhea with
laxative abuse

Weight loss is associated with reduced volume
and tone of GI tract musculature, especially
the stomach
Laxatives may be used to relieve constipation or

274 Part III u Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders
overactive thyroid, such as hypothermia, bradycardia, and constipation, as well as weight loss and excessive physical activity, respectively.
In the CNS, craniopharyngiomas and Rathke pouch tumors can
mimic some of the findings of AN, such as weight loss and growth
failure, and even some body image disturbances, but the latter are
less fixed than in typical EDs and are associated with other findings,
including evidence of increased intracranial pressure. Mitochondrial
neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy, caused by a mutation in
the TYMP gene, presents with gastrointestinal dysmotility, cachexia,
ptosis, peripheral neuropathy, ophthalmoplegia, and leukoencephalopathy. Symptoms begin during the second decade of life and are
often initially diagnosed as AN. Early satiety, vomiting, cramps, constipation, and pseudoobstruction result in weight loss often before the
neurologic features are noticed (see Chapter 638.2). Acute or chronic
oromotor dysfunction and obsessive-­compulsive disorder may mimic
an ED. Fear of choking may lead to avoidance-­restrictive food intake
disorder.
Any patient with an atypical presentation of an ED, based on age, sex,
or other factors not typical for AN or BN, deserves a scrupulous search
for an alternative explanation. In ARFID, disturbance in the neurosensory processes associated with eating, not weight loss, is the central
concern and must be recognized for appropriate treatment. Patients
can have both an underlying illness and an ED. The core features of
dysfunctional eating habits (body image disturbance and change in
weight) can co-­occur with conditions such as diabetes mellitus, where
patients might manipulate their insulin dosing to lose weight.

LABORATORY FINDINGS

Because the diagnosis of an ED is made clinically, there is no confirmatory laboratory test. Laboratory abnormalities, when found, are the
result of malnutrition secondary to weight control behaviors or medical
complications; studies should be chosen based on history and physical
examination. A routine screening battery typically includes complete
blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (should be normal), and
biochemical profile. Common abnormalities in ED include low white
blood cell count with normal hemoglobin and differential; hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis from severe vomiting; mildly
elevated liver enzymes, cholesterol, and cortisol levels; low gonadotropins and blood glucose with marked weight loss; and generally
normal total protein, albumin, and renal function. An electrocardiogram (ECG) may be useful when profound bradycardia or arrhythmia
is detected; the ECG usually has low voltage, with nonspecific ST or
T-­wave changes. Although prolonged QTc has been reported, prospective studies have not found an increased risk for this. Nonetheless,
when a prolonged QTc is present in a patient with ED, it may increase
the risk for ventricular dysrhythmias.

COMPLICATIONS

No organ is spared the harmful effects of dysfunctional weight control behaviors, but the most concerning targets of medical complications are the heart, brain, gonads, and bones. Some cardiac findings
in EDs (e.g., sinus bradycardia, hypotension) are physiologic adaptations to starvation that conserve calories and reduce afterload.
Cold, blue hands and feet with slow capillary refill that can result
in tissue perfusion insufficient to meet demands also represent
energy-­
conserving responses associated with inadequate intake.
All these acute changes are reversible with restoration of nutrition and weight. Significant orthostatic pulse changes, ventricular
dysrhythmias, or reduced myocardial contractility reflect myocardial impairment that can be lethal. In addition, with extremely low
weight, refeeding syndrome (a result of the rapid drop in serum
phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium with excessive reintroduction of calories, specifically carbohydrates), is associated with
acute tachycardia and heart failure and neurologic symptoms (see
Chapter 63). With long-­term malnutrition, the myocardium appears
to be more prone to tachyarrhythmias, the second most common
cause of death in these patients after suicide. In BN, dysrhythmias
can also be related to electrolyte imbalance.

Clinically, the primary CNS area affected acutely in EDs, especially
with weight loss, is the hypothalamus. Hypothalamic dysfunction is
reflected in problems with thermoregulation (warming and cooling),
satiety, sleep, autonomic cardioregulatory imbalance (orthostasis),
and endocrine function (reduced gonadal and excessive adrenal cortex stimulation), all of which are reversible. Anatomic studies of the
brain in ED have focused on AN, with the most common finding being
increased ventricular and sulcal volumes that normalize with weight
restoration. Persistent gray matter deficits following recovery, related to
the degree of weight loss, have been reported. Elevated medial temporal lobe cerebral blood flow on positron emission tomography, similar
to that found in psychotic patients, suggests that these changes may be
related to body image distortion. Also, visualizing high-­calorie foods is
associated with exaggerated responses in the visual association cortex
that are similar to those seen in patients with specific phobias. Patients
with AN might have an imbalance between serotonin and dopamine
pathways related to neurocircuits in which dietary restraint reduces
anxiety.
Reduced gonadal function occurs in male and female patients; it
is clinically manifested in AN as amenorrhea in female patients and
erectile dysfunction in males. It is related to understimulation from the
hypothalamus as well as cortical suppression related to physical and
emotional stress. Amenorrhea precedes significant dieting and weight
loss in up to 30% of females with AN, and most adolescents with EDs
perceive the absence of menses positively. The primary health concern
is the negative effect of decreased ovarian function and estrogen on
bones. Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) with osteopenia or the
more severe osteoporosis is a significant complication of EDs (more
pronounced in AN than BN). Data do not support the use of sex hormone replacement therapy because this alone does not improve other
causes of low BMD (low body weight, lean body mass, low insulin-­like
growth factor-­1, high cortisol).

TREATMENT
Principles Guiding Primary Care Treatment

The approach in primary care should facilitate the acceptance by the
ED patient (and parents) of the diagnosis and initial treatment recommendations. A nurturant-­authoritative approach using the biopsychosocial model is useful. A pediatrician who explicitly acknowledges
that the patient may disagree with the diagnosis and treatment recommendations and may be ambivalent about changing eating habits,
while also acknowledging that recovery requires strength, courage,
willpower, and determination, demonstrates nurturance. Parents also
find it easier to be nurturing once they learn that the development of
an ED is neither a willful decision by the patient nor a reflection of
poor parenting. Framing the ED as a “maladaptive coping mechanism”
for a complex variety of issues with both positive and negative aspects
avoids blame or guilt and can prepare the family for professional help
that will focus on strengths and restoring health, rather than on the
deficits in the adolescent or the family.
The authoritative aspect of a physician’s role comes from expertise in
health, growth, and physical development. A goal of primary care treatment should be attaining and maintaining health, not merely weight
gain, although weight gain is a means to the goal of wellness. Providers
who frame themselves as consultants to the patient with authoritative
knowledge about health can avoid a countertherapeutic authoritarian
stance. Primary care health-­focused activities include monitoring the
patient’s physical status, setting limits on behaviors that threaten the
patient’s health, involving specialists with expertise in EDs on the treatment team, and continuing to provide primary care for health maintenance, acute illness, or injury.
The biopsychosocial model uses a broad ecologic framework,
starting with the biologic impairments of physical health related
to dysfunctional weight control practices, evidenced by symptoms
and signs. Explicitly linking ED behaviors to symptoms and signs
can increase motivation to change. In addition, there are usually
unresolved psychosocial conflicts in both the intrapersonal (self-­
esteem, self-­efficacy) and the interpersonal (family, peers, school)

Chapter 41 u Eating Disorders
domains. Weight control practices initiated as coping mechanisms
become reinforced because of positive feedback. That is, external
rewards (e.g., compliments about improved physical appearance)
and internal rewards (e.g., perceived mastery over what is eaten or
what is done to minimize the effects of overeating through exercise
or purging) are more powerful to maintain behavior than negative
feedback (e.g., conflict with parents, peers, and others about eating)
is to change it. Thus, when definitive treatment is initiated, more
productive alternative means of coping must be developed.

Nutrition and Physical Activity

The primary care provider generally begins the process of prescribing nutrition, although a dietitian should be involved eventually in
the meal planning and nutritional education of patients with AN or
BN. Framing food as fuel for the body and the source of energy for
daily activities emphasizes the health goal of increasing the patient’s
energy level, endurance, and strength. For patients with AN and low
weight, the nutrition prescription should work toward gradually
increasing weight at the rate of about 0.5-­1 lb/week, by increasing
energy intake by 100-­200 kcal increments every few days, toward a
target of approximately 90% of average body weight for sex, height,
and age. Weight gain will not occur until intake exceeds output, and
eventual intake for continued weight gain can exceed 4,000 kcal/
day, especially for patients who are anxious and have high levels of
thermogenesis from nonexercise activity. Stabilizing intake is the
goal for patients with BN, with a gradual introduction of “forbidden” foods while also limiting foods that might trigger a binge.
When initiating treatment of an ED in a primary care setting, the
clinician should be aware of common cognitive patterns. Patients
with AN typically have all-­or-­none thinking (related to perfectionism) with a tendency to overgeneralize and jump to catastrophic
conclusions, while assuming that their body is governed by rules
that do not apply to others. These tendencies lead to the dichotomization of foods into good or bad categories, having a day ruined
because of one unexpected event, or choosing foods based on rigid
self-­imposed restrictions. These thoughts may be related to neurocircuitry and neurotransmitter abnormalities associated with
executive function and rewards. Weight loss in the absence of body
shape, size, or weight concerns should raise suspicion about ARFID,
because the emotional distress associated with “forced” eating is not
associated with gaining weight, but with the neurosensory experience of eating.
A standard nutritional balance of 15–20% calories from protein,
50–55% from carbohydrate, and 25–30% from fat is appropriate.
The fat content may need to be lowered to 15–20% early in the
treatment of AN because of continued fat phobia. With the risk of
low BMD in patients with AN, calcium and vitamin D supplements
are often needed to attain the recommended 1,300 mg/day intake of
calcium. Refeeding can be accomplished with frequent small meals
and snacks consisting of a variety of foods and beverages (with
minimal diet or fat-­f ree products), rather than fewer high-­volume
high-­calorie meals. Some patients find it easier to take in part of
the additional nutrition as canned supplements (medicine) rather
than food. Regardless of the source of energy intake, the risk for
refeeding syndrome (e.g., see the previous section on “Complications”) increases with the degree of weight loss and the rapidity
of caloric increases (see Chapter 63). Therefore, if the weight has
fallen below 80% of expected weight for height, refeeding should
proceed carefully (not necessarily slowly) and possibly in the hospital (Table 41.7).
Patients with AN tend to have a highly structured day with
restrictive intake, in contrast to BN, which is characterized by a lack
of structure, resulting in chaotic eating patterns and binge-­purge
episodes. All patients with AN, BN, or ED-­NOS benefit from a daily
structure for healthy eating that includes three meals and at least one
snack a day, distributed evenly over the day, based on balanced meal
planning. Breakfast deserves special emphasis because it is often the

first meal eliminated in AN and is often avoided the morning after
a binge-­purge episode in BN. In addition to structuring meals and
snacks, patients should plan structure in their activities. Although
overexercising is common in AN, completely prohibiting exercise
can lead to further restriction of intake or to surreptitious exercise;
inactivity should be limited to situations in which weight loss is dramatic or there is physiologic instability. Also, healthy exercise (once
a day, for no more than 30 min, at no more than moderate intensity)
can improve mood and make increasing calories more acceptable.
Because patients with AN often are unaware of their level of activity
and tend toward progressively increasing their output, exercising
without either a partner or supervision is not recommended.

Primary Care Treatment

Follow-­up primary care visits are essential in the management of
EDs. Close monitoring of the response of the patient and the family
to suggested interventions is required to determine which patients
can remain in primary care treatment (patients with early, mildly
disordered eating), which patients need to be referred to individual specialists for co-­management (mildly progressive disordered
eating), and which patients need to be referred for interdisciplinary team management (EDs). Between the initial and subsequent
visits, the patient can record daily caloric intake (food, drink,
amount, time, location), physical activity (type, duration, intensity), and emotional state (e.g., angry, sad, worried) in a journal
that is reviewed jointly with the patient in follow-­up. Focusing on
the recorded data helps the clinician to identify dietary and activity
deficiencies and excesses, as well as behavioral and mental health
patterns, and helps the patient to become objectively aware of the
relevant issues to address in recovery.
Given the tendency of patients with AN to overestimate their caloric
intake and underestimate their activity level, before reviewing the
journal record it is important at each visit to measure weight, without underwear, in a hospital gown after voiding; urine specific gravity; temperature; and blood pressure and pulse in supine, sitting, and
standing positions as objective data. In addition, a targeted physical
examination focused on hypometabolism, cardiovascular stability, and
mental status, as well as any related symptoms, should occur at each
visit to monitor progress (or regression).

276 Part III u Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders
Referral to Mental Health Services

In addition to referral to a registered dietitian, mental health and other
services are important elements of treatment of ED patients. Depending on availability and experience, these services can be provided by
a psychiatric social worker, psychologist, or psychiatrist, who should
team with the primary care provider. ARFID presents the challenge
of working with patients’ negative experiences of eating, or fear of
trauma such as vomiting or choking, while also addressing inadequate
nutritional needs. Although patients with AN often are prescribed a
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) because of depressive
symptoms, there is no evidence of efficacy for patients at low weight;
food remains the initial treatment of choice to treat depression in AN.
SSRIs, very effective in reducing binge-­purge behaviors regardless of
depression, are considered a standard element of therapy in BN. SSRI
dosage in BN, however, may need to increase to an equivalent of >60
mg of fluoxetine to maintain effectiveness.
Cognitive-­behavioral therapy, which focuses on restructuring
“thinking errors” and establishing adaptive patterns of behavior, is
more effective than interpersonal or psychoanalytic approaches in ED
patients. Dialectical behavioral therapy, in which distorted thoughts
and emotional responses are challenged, analyzed, and replaced with
healthier ones, with an emphasis on “mindfulness,” requires adult
thinking skills and is useful for older patients with BN. Group therapy can provide much needed support, but it requires a skilled clinician. Combining patients at various levels of recovery who experience
variable reinforcement from dysfunctional coping behaviors can be
challenging if group therapy patients compete with each other to be
“thinner” or take up new behaviors such as vomiting.
The younger the patient, the more intimately the parents need to
be involved in therapy. The only treatment approach with evidence-­
based effectiveness in the treatment of AN in children and adolescents
is family-­based treatment, exemplified by the Maudsley approach.
This three-­phase intensive outpatient model helps parents play a positive role in restoring their child’s eating and weight to normal, then
returns control of eating to the child, who has demonstrated the ability
to maintain healthy weight, and then encourages healthy progression
in the other domains of adolescent development. Features of effective
family treatment include (1) an agnostic approach in which the cause
of the disease is unknown and irrelevant to weight gain, emphasizing
that parents are not to blame for EDs; (2) parents being actively nurturing and supportive of their child’s healthy eating while reinforcing limits on dysfunctional habits, rather than an authoritarian “food police”
or complete hands-­off approach; and (3) reinforcement of parents as
the best resource for recovery for almost all patients, with professionals
serving as consultants and advisors to help parents address challenges.

Referral to an Interdisciplinary Eating Disorder Team

The treatment of a child or adolescent diagnosed with an ED is ideally
provided by an interdisciplinary team (physician, nurse, dietitian, mental health provider) with expertise treating pediatric patients. Because
such teams, often led by specialists in adolescent medicine at medical
centers, are not widely available, the primary care provider might need
to convene such a team. Adolescent medicine–based programs report
encouraging treatment outcomes, possibly related to patients entering
earlier into care and the stigma that some patients and parents may
associate with psychiatry-­based programs. Specialty centers focused on
treating EDs are generally based in psychiatry and often have separate
tracks for younger and adult patients. The elements of treatment noted
earlier (cognitive-­
behavioral, dialectical behavioral, family-­
based),
as well as individual and group treatment, should all be available as
part of interdisciplinary team treatment. Comprehensive services ideally include intensive outpatient and partial hospitalization as well as
inpatient treatment. Regardless of the intensity, type, or location of the
treatment services, the patient, parents, and primary care provider are
essential members of the treatment team. A recurring theme in effective treatment is helping patients and families reestablish connections
that are disrupted by the ED.

Inpatient medical treatment of EDs is generally limited to patients
with AN to stabilize and treat life-­threatening starvation and to provide supportive mental health services. Inpatient medical care may
be required to avoid refeeding syndrome in severely malnourished
patients, provide nasogastric tube feeding for patients unable or
unwilling to eat, or initiate mental health services, especially family-­
based treatment, if this has not occurred on an outpatient basis (see
Table 41.7). Admission to a general pediatric unit is advised only for
short-­term stabilization in preparation for transfer to a medical unit
with expertise in treating pediatric EDs. Inpatient psychiatric care of
EDs should be provided on a unit with expertise in managing often
challenging behaviors (e.g., hiding or discarding food, vomiting, surreptitious exercise) and emotional problems (e.g., depression, anxiety).
Suicidal risk is small, but patients with AN might threaten suicide if
made to eat or gain weight in an effort to “get their parents to back off.”
An ED partial hospital program offers outpatient services that are
less intensive than round-­the-­clock inpatient care. Generally held 4-­5
days/week for 6 to 9 hours each session, partial hospital program services typically are group based and include eating at least two meals
as well as opportunities to address issues in a setting that more closely
approximates “real life” than inpatient treatment. That is, patients sleep
at home and are free-­living on weekends, exposing them to challenges
that can be processed during the 25-­40 hours each week in program, as
well as sharing group and family experiences.

Supportive Care

In relation to pediatric EDs, support groups are primarily designed
for parents. Because their daughter or son with an ED often resists
the diagnosis and treatment, parents often feel helpless and hopeless.
Because of the historical precedent of blaming parents for causing EDs,
parents often express feelings of shame and isolation (www.maudsley
parents.org). Support groups and multifamily therapy sessions bring
parents together with other parents whose families are at various stages
of recovery from an ED in ways that are educational and encouraging.
Patients often benefit from support groups after intensive treatment or
at the end of treatment because of residual body image or other issues
after eating and weight have normalized.

PROGNOSIS

With early diagnosis and effective treatment, ≥80% of youth with
AN recover: They develop normal eating and weight control habits,
resume menses, maintain average weight for height, and function in
school, work, and relationships, although some still have poor body
image. With weight restoration, fertility returns as well, although
the weight for resumption of menses (approximately 92% of average
body weight for height) may be lower than the weight for ovulation.
The prognosis for BN is less well established, but outcome improves
with multidimensional treatment that includes SSRIs and attention
to mood, past trauma, impulsivity, and any existing psychopathology. Since the diagnosis of ARFID was only established in 2013,
little is known about its long-­term prognosis, although anecdotal
evidence suggests that weight restoration is not actively resisted as
it is in AN.

PREVENTION

Given the complexity of the pathogenesis of EDs, prevention is difficult. Targeted preventive interventions can reduce risk factors in older
adolescents and college-­age women. Universal prevention efforts to
promote healthy weight regulation and discourage unhealthy dieting
have not shown effectiveness in middle school students. Programs that
include recovered patients or focus on the problems associated with
EDs can inadvertently normalize or even glamorize EDs and should
be discouraged.

Chapter 42 u Disruptive, Impulse-­Control, and Conduct Disorders

Chapter 42

Disruptive,
Impulse-­Control, and
Conduct Disorders
Erica H. Lee, Keneisha R. Sinclair-­McBride,
David R. DeMaso, and Heather J. Walter
The disruptive, impulse-­
control, and conduct disorders (CDs) are
interrelated sets of psychiatric symptoms characterized by a core deficit
in self-­regulation of anger, aggression, defiance, and antisocial behaviors that typically begin in childhood or adolescence. These disorders
include oppositional defiant, intermittent explosive, conduct, and other
specified/unspecified disruptive/impulse-­control/CDs, as well as pyromania, kleptomania, and antisocial personality disorder. Although all
involve difficulty with both emotional and behavioral self-­regulation,
the disorders vary by the relative intensity of problems with emotional
regulation (e.g., anger outbursts) vs behavioral regulation (e.g., defiance, aggression, violating the rights of others or societal norms).

DESCRIPTION

Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) is characterized by a persistent
pattern lasting at least 6 months of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, and/or vindictiveness exhibited during interaction with at least one individual who is not a sibling (Table 42.1). For
preschool children, the behavior must occur on most days, whereas in
school-­age children, the behavior must occur at least once a week. The
severity of the disorder is considered mild if symptoms are confined to
only one setting (e.g., at home, at school, at work, with peers), moderate
if symptoms are present in at least two settings, and severe if symptoms
are present in three or more settings.
Intermittent explosive disorder (IED) is characterized by recurrent verbal or physical aggression that is grossly disproportionate
to the provocation or to any precipitating psychosocial stressors
(Table 42.2). The outbursts, which are impulsive and/or anger-­based
rather than premeditated and/or instrumental, typically onset rapidly, last <30 minutes, and frequently occur in response to a minor
provocation by a close intimate.
CD is characterized by a repetitive and persistent pattern over at
least 12 months of serious aggressive, destructive, and/or rule-­
violating behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age-­
appropriate societal norms or rules are violated (Table 42.3). The
symptoms of CD are divided into four major categories: aggression
to people and animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft,
and serious rule violations (e.g., truancy, running away). Three subtypes of CD (which have different prognostic significance) are based
on the age of onset: childhood-­onset type, adolescent-­onset type, and
unspecified. A small proportion of individuals with CD exhibit characteristics (lack of remorse/guilt, callous/lack of empathy, unconcerned about performance, shallow/deficient affect) that qualify for
the “with limited prosocial emotions” specifier. CD is classified as
mild when few if any symptoms over those required for the diagnosis
are present, and the symptoms cause relatively minor harm to others. CD is classified as severe if many symptoms over those required
for the diagnosis are present, and the symptoms cause considerable
harm to others. Moderate severity is intermediate between mild and
severe.
Other specified/unspecified disruptive/impulse-­
control/CD
(subsyndromal disorder) applies to presentations in which symptoms
characteristic of the disorders in this class are present and cause clinically significant distress or functional impairment, but do not meet full
diagnostic criteria for any of the disorders in this class.

277

EPIDEMIOLOGY

The prevalence of ODD is approximately 3%, and in preadolescents
is more common in males than females (1.4:1). One-­year prevalence
rates for IED and CD approximate 3% and 4%, respectively. For CD,
prevalence rates rise from childhood to adolescence and are higher
among males than females.

CLINICAL COURSE

Oppositional behavior can occur in all children and adolescents at
times, particularly during the toddler and early teenage periods when
autonomy and independence are normative developmental tasks.
Oppositional behavior becomes a concern when it is frequent, intense,
persistent, and pervasive and when it affects the child’s social, family,
and/or academic life. Some of the earliest manifestations of oppositionality are stubbornness (3 years), defiance and temper tantrums (4-­5
years), and argumentativeness (6 years). Approximately 65% of children with ODD exit from the diagnosis after a 3-­year follow-­up; earlier age at onset of oppositional symptoms conveys a poorer prognosis.
ODD often precedes the development of CD and there is an approximately 30% higher likelihood of CD when ODD is comorbid with
attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ODD also increases
the risk for the development of depressive and anxiety disorders. The
defiant, argumentative, and vindictive symptoms carry most of the risk
for CD, whereas the angry, irritable mood symptoms carry most of the
risk for depression and anxiety.
IED usually begins in late childhood or adolescence and appears to
follow a persistent course over many years, with recurrent periods of
impulsive and aggressive outbursts.
The onset of CD may occur as early as the preschool years, but the
first significant symptoms usually emerge during the period from
middle childhood through middle adolescence; onset is rare after age
16 years. Symptoms of CD vary with age as the individual develops
increased physical strength, cognitive abilities, and sexual maturity.
Symptoms that emerge first tend to be less serious (e.g., lying), while
those emerging later tend to be more severe (e.g., sexual or physical
assault). Severe behaviors emerging at an early age convey a poor prognosis. In the majority of individuals, the disorder remits by adulthood;
in a substantial fraction, antisocial personality disorder develops. Individuals with CD also are at risk for the later development of mood,
anxiety, posttraumatic stress, impulse-­
control, psychotic, somatic
symptom, and substance-­related disorders.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

The disorders in this diagnostic class share a number of characteristics
with each other as well as with disorders from other classes, and as such
must be carefully differentiated. ODD can be distinguished from CD
by the absence of physical aggression and destructiveness and by the
presence of angry, irritable mood. ODD can be distinguished from IED
by the lack of serious aggression toward others (e.g., physical assault).
IED can be distinguished from CD by the lack of predatory aggression
and other, nonaggressive symptoms of CD.
The oppositionality seen in ODD, the explosivity seen in IED, and
the aggression/destructiveness seen in CD must be distinguished from
those symptoms occurring in the context of other psychiatric disorders, particularly ADHD, depression, and bipolar, substance-­related,
autism spectrum, or psychotic disorders.

COMORBIDITY

Rates of ODD are much higher in children with ADHD, which suggests
shared temperamental risk factors. Depressive, anxiety, and substance-­
related disorders are most often comorbid with IED. ADHD and ODD
are both common in individuals with CD, and this comorbid presentation predicts worse outcomes. CD may also occur with anxiety, depressive, bipolar, learning, language, and substance-­related disorders.

SEQUELAE

The disruptive, impulse-­
control, and CDs are associated with a
wide range of psychiatric disorders in adulthood and with many
other adverse outcomes, such as suicidal behavior, physical injury,

278 Part III u Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders
Table 42.1  DSM-­5 Diagnostic Criteria for Oppositional
Defiant Disorder

Table 42.2  DSM-­5 Diagnostic Criteria for Intermittent
Explosive Disorder

A.	A pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior,
or vindictiveness lasting at least 6 mo as evidenced by at least four
symptoms from any of the following categories, and exhibited
during interaction with at least one individual who is not a sibling:

A.	Recurrent behavioral outbursts representing a failure to control
aggressive impulses as manifested by either of the following:
1.	Verbal aggression (e.g., temper tantrums, tirades, verbal
arguments or fights) or physical aggression toward property,
animals, or other individuals, occurring twice weekly, on
average, for a period of 3 mo. The physical aggression does
not result in damage or destruction of property and does not
result in physical injury to animals or other individuals.
2.	Three behavioral outbursts involving damage or destruction
of property and/or physical assault involving physical injury
against animals or other individuals occurring with a 12 mo
period.

ANGRY/IRRITABLE MOOD
1.	Often loses temper.
2.	Is often touchy or easily annoyed.
3.	Is often angry and resentful.
ARGUMENTATIVE/DEFIANT BEHAVIOR
4.	Often argues with authority figures or, for children and
adolescents, with adults.
5.	Often actively defies or refuses to comply with requests from
authority figures or with rules.
6.	Often deliberately annoys others.
7.	Often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior.
VINDICTIVENESS
8.	Has been spiteful or vindictive at least twice within the past 6
mo.
Note: The persistence and frequency of these behaviors should be
used to distinguish a behavior that is within normal limits from a
behavior that is symptomatic. For children younger than 5 yr, the
behavior should occur on most days for a period of at least 6 mo
unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8). For individuals 5 yr or older,
the behavior should occur at least once per week for at least 6 mo,
unless otherwise noted (Criterion A8). Although these frequency
criteria provide guidance on a minimal level of frequency to define
symptoms, other factors should be considered, such as whether
the frequency and intensity of the behaviors are outside a range
that is normative for the individual’s developmental level, gender,
and culture.
B.	The disturbance in behavior is associated with distress in the
individual or others in his or her immediate social context (e.g.,
family, peer group, work colleagues), or it impacts negatively on
social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning.

B.	The magnitude of aggressiveness expressed during the recurrent
outbursts is grossly out of proportion to the provocation or to any
precipitating psychosocial stressors.
C.	The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not premeditated (i.e.,
they are impulsive and/or anger-­based) and are not committed to
achieve some tangible objective (e.g., money, power,
intimidation).
D.	The recurrent aggressive outbursts cause either marked distress
in the individual or impairment in occupational or interpersonal
functioning, or as associated with financial or legal consequences.
E.	Chronologic age is at least 6 yr (or equivalent developmental
level).
F.	The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not better explained by
another mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder, bipolar
disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a psychotic
disorder, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality
disorder) and are not attributable to another medical condition
(e.g., head trauma, Alzheimer disease) or to the physiologic
effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication). For
children ages 6-­18 yr, aggressive behavior that occurs as part of
an adjustment disorder should not be considered for this diagnosis.

C.	The behaviors do not occur exclusively during the course of a
psychotic, substance use, depressive, or bipolar disorder. Also, the
criteria are not met for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.

Note: This diagnosis can be made in addition to the diagnosis of
attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional
defiant disorder, or autism spectrum disorder when recurrent
impulsive aggressive outbursts are in excess of those usually
seen in these disorders and warrant clinical attention.

delinquency and criminality, legal problems, substance use, unplanned
pregnancy, social instability, marital failure, and academic and occupational underachievement.

are more likely to elicit negative parenting responses, including physical
punishment, which can exacerbate anger and oppositionality in the child.
Other important family-­level influences include impaired parent–child
attachment, child maltreatment (physical and sexual abuse, neglect), exposure to marital conflict and domestic violence, family poverty and crime,
frequent changes in caregivers, and family genetic liability (family history
of the disorders in this class along with substance use, depressive, bipolar,
schizophrenic, somatization, and personality disorders, as well as ADHD,
have all been shown to be associated with the development of behavior
disorders).
Peer-­level influence on the development of behavior problems includes
peer rejection in childhood and antisocial peer groups. Neighborhood
influences include social processes such as collective efficacy, social control, and exposure to violence. Culturally, it is helpful to consider the
context in which undesirable behaviors occur to better understand their
function.

ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS

At the individual level, a number of neurobiologic markers (lower heart
rate and skin conductance reactivity, reduced basal cortisol reactivity,
abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, serotonergic abnormalities) have been variously associated with aggressive behavior disorders. Other biologic risk factors include pre-­, peri-­, and postnatal insults;
cognitive and linguistic impairment, particularly language-­based learning
deficits; difficult temperamental characteristics, particularly negative affectivity, emotional reactivity, poor frustration tolerance, and impulsivity; certain personality characteristics (novelty seeking, reduced harm avoidance,
and reward dependence); and certain cognitive characteristics (cognitive
rigidity, hostile attributions for ambiguous social cues).
At the family level, a consistently demonstrated risk factor is ineffective
parenting. Parents of behaviorally disordered children are more inconsistent in their use of rules, issue more and unclear commands, are more likely
to respond to their child based on their own mood rather than the child’s
behavior, are more likely to utilize a harsh or neglectful parenting style, are
less likely to monitor their children’s whereabouts, and are relatively unresponsive to their children’s prosocial behavior. Complicating this association is the consistent finding that temperamentally difficult children

A.	A repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic
rights of others or major age-­appropriate societal norms or rules
are violated, as manifested by the presence of at least 3 of the
following 15 criteria in the past 12 mo from any of the following
categories, with at least one criterion present in the past 6 mo:
AGGRESSION TO PEOPLE AND ANIMALS
1.	Often bullies, threatens, or intimidates others.

13.	Often stays out at night despite parental prohibitions,
beginning before age 13 yr.
14.	Has run away from home overnight at least twice while living
in the parental or parental surrogate home, or once without
returning for a lengthy period.
15.	Is often truant from school, beginning before age 13 yr.

abuse problem than program nonparticipants. Program participants also
had lower violent and drug crime conviction scores, lower risky sexual
behavior scores, and higher well-­being scores. Another useful prevention
program, the Seattle Social Development Project, was also a multicomponent school-­based intervention with teacher, parent, and student components targeting classroom management, interpersonal problem solving,
child behavior management, and academic support skills. Implemented
in grades 1 through 6, outcomes at age 19 years demonstrated that the
intervention decreased lifetime drug use and delinquency for participant
males compared with males in comparator communities but had no significant effects on females.

SCREENING/CASE FINDING

The parents of children presenting in the primary care setting should
be queried about angry mood or aggressive, defiant, or antisocial
behavior as part of the routine clinical interview. A typical screening question would be, “Does [name] have a lot of trouble controlling
[his/her] anger or behavior?” A number of standardized broad-­band
screening instruments widely used in the primary care setting (e.g.,
Pediatric Symptom Checklist, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire)
have items specific to angry mood and aggressive behavior, and as such
can also be used to identify problems in this domain.

279

EARLY INTERVENTION

Youth (and/or their parents) presenting in the primary care setting who
self-­report or respond affirmatively to queries about difficulties managing angry mood or aggressive or antisocial behavior should be afforded
the opportunity to talk about the situation with the pediatric practitioner (separately with older youth as indicated). By engaging in active
listening (e.g., “I hear how you have been feeling. Tell me more about
what happened to make you feel that way”), the pediatric practitioner
can establish therapeutic rapport and begin to assess the onset, duration,
context, severity, and complexity of the symptoms, and associated dangerousness, distress, and functional impairment. In the absence of acute
dangerousness (e.g., homicidality, assaultiveness, psychosis, substance
abuse) and significant distress or functional impairment, the pediatric
practitioner can schedule a follow-­up appointment within a few weeks
to conduct a behavior assessment. At this follow-­up visit, to assist with
decision-­making about appropriate level of care, a focused symptom
rating scale can be administered (Table 42.4) and additional risk factors
explored (e.g., see the previous section on “Etiology and Risk Factors”).
For mild symptoms (manageable by the parent and not functionally impairing) and in the absence of major risk factors, guided self-­help
(anticipatory guidance) and monitoring with a scheduled follow-­up may
suffice. Guided self-­help can include provision of educational materials
(pamphlets, books, videos, workbooks, internet sites) that provide information to the youth about dealing with anger-­provoking situations, and
advice to parents about strengthening the parent–child relationship, effective parenting strategies, and the effects of adverse environmental exposures on the development of behavior problems. In a Cochrane review,
media-­based parenting interventions had a moderate positive effect on
child behavior problems, either alone or as an adjunct to medication. An
example of a self-­help program for parents is the Positive Parenting Program (Triple P; http://www.triplep-­parenting.com), online version, in
which parents can purchase 6-­8 modules of instruction addressing techniques for positive parenting and strategies for encouraging good behavior,
teaching new emotional and behavioral skills, and managing misbehavior
with youth from toddlers to teens (see Chapter 20).
If a mental health clinician has been co-­located or integrated into the
primary care setting, all parents of young children (universal prevention),
as well as the parents of youth with mild behavior problems (indicated
prevention), could be provided with a brief version of behavioral parent
training. For example, Incredible Years (http://www.incredibleyears.com)
has a 4-­8 session universal prevention version to help parents promote
their 2–6-­year-­old children’s emotional regulation, social competence,
problem solving, and reading readiness. A randomized trial in pediatric
practices found that Incredible Years significantly improved parenting
practices and 2–4-­year-­olds’ disruptive behaviors compared to a wait-­list
control. Incredible Years’ positive effects on parenting and child behavior
have been found for populations diverse in race, cultural background,
and socioeconomic status. Similarly, the Triple P program has seminar
(three, 90 minute sessions), brief (15-­30 min consultations), and primary
care (four, 20-­30 minute consultations) versions for the parents of youth
from birth to the teenage years, specifically designed for implementation
in the primary care setting. The Triple P interventions, supported by an
extensive evidence base, focus on strengthening the parent–child relationship, identifying and monitoring the frequency of a problem behavior, and
implementing and reviewing the effects of a targeted behavior plan. Meta-­
analyses have found that gains from Triple P are maintained over time.

TREATMENT

For youth who continue to have mild to moderate behavior problems after
several weeks of guided self-­help or a brief course of behavioral parent
training, or who from the outset exhibit moderate to severe symptoms, or
who have a history of maltreatment or severe family dysfunction or psychopathology, assessment and treatment in the specialty mental health setting by a child-­trained mental health clinician should be provided.
The youth’s problem behavior may predominantly occur at home, at
school, with peers, or in the community, or it may be pervasive. If possible,
interventions need to address each context specifically, rather than assuming generalizability of treatment. Thus, for behaviors mostly manifested
in the home setting, behavioral parent training would be the treatment of

choice, whereas for behaviors manifested mostly at school, consultation
with the teacher regarding an assessment for a 504 plan or individualized
education plan (IEP) can be useful. School-­based services can include a
functional behavioral analysis to determine the function of the problematic
behavior for the child, and development of a behavioral intervention plan
to direct the child toward alternative positive behaviors that can achieve
the same goal. School-­based services should be considered whenever a
child is subjected to repeated disciplinary action in school or suspensions
for misbehavior. When there are pervasive problems, including aggression
toward peers, cognitive-­behavioral therapy (CBT) with the child/teen
can be employed in addition to the other interventions.
Behavioral parent training has been extensively studied for the treatment of youth problem behavior. These programs work by reshaping negative family patterns that may trigger or reinforce problem behaviors. They
are typically 10-­15 weeks in duration and focus on some combination
of the following components: understanding social learning principles,
developing a warm supportive relationship with the child, encouraging
child-­directed interaction and play, providing a predictable structured
household environment, setting clear and simple household rules, consistently praising and materially or socially rewarding positive behavior,
consistently ignoring annoying behavior (followed by praise when the
annoying behavior ceases), giving effective commands, and consistently
giving consequences (e.g., time-­
out, loss of privileges) for dangerous
or destructive behavior. Other important targets for parenting training
include understanding developmentally appropriate moods and behavior, managing difficult temperamental characteristics, fostering the child’s
social and emotional development, and protecting the child from traumatic exposures. Parent training can be implemented with families in
individual or group formats. Specific parent training programs include
Incredible Years and Triple P, described earlier, and Parent–Child Interaction Therapy, Helping the Noncompliant Child, and Parent Management
Training Oregon. Predictors of nonresponse to these interventions have
included greater initial symptom severity as well as involvement of the
parent with child protection services.
Difficulty with adherence to the complete treatment regimen has limited the effectiveness of parent training programs. Estimates of premature
termination are as high as 50–60%, and termination within five treatment
sessions is not uncommon. Predictors of premature termination have
included single-­parent status, low family income, low parental education
levels, young maternal age, minority group status, and life stresses.
CBT for youth with disruptive behavior also has been extensively studied. Common CBT techniques for disruptive behavior include identifying
the antecedents and consequences of disruptive or aggressive behavior,
learning strategies for recognizing and regulating anger expression,
problem-­solving and cognitive restructuring (perspective-­taking) techniques, and modeling and rehearsing socially appropriate behaviors that
could replace angry or aggressive reactions. Programs typically are delivered in 16-­20 weekly sessions.
Multicomponent treatments for serious behavior disorders such as CD
target the broader social context. Multidimensional Treatment Foster
Care, delivered in a foster care setting for 6-­9 months, typically includes
foster parent training and support; family therapy for biologic parents;
youth anger management, social skills, and problem-­
solving training; school-­based behavioral interventions and academic support; and

psychiatric consultation and medication management, when needed.
Multisystemic Therapy, typically lasting 3-­5 months, generally includes
social competence training, parent and family skills training, medications, academic engagement and skills building, school interventions
and peer mediation, mentoring and after-­school programs, and involvement of child-­serving agencies. Due to the strength of the supporting
evidence, these multicomponent programs have been designated “well-­
established” treatments for adolescents involved in the juvenile justice
system. Predictors of nonresponse to multicomponent treatments have
included higher frequency of rule-­breaking behavior and predatory
aggression, higher psychopathy scores, and comorbid mood disorders.
Psychosocial interventions should be considered the first-­line intervention; pharmacotherapy may provide benefit, particularly if psychosocial treatment has not led to adequate improvement. Three classes of
medication, stimulants, α2-­adrenergic agonists, and atypical antipsychotics, have evidence for the management of impulsive, anger-­driven
aggressive behavior, although none is approved by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) for this indication, except irritability/
aggression in autism. Resource limitations may necessitate provision
of pharmacotherapy in the primary care setting; the safety and efficacy
of this practice can be enhanced by regular consultation with a child
and adolescent psychiatrist or developmental-­behavioral pediatrician.
There are favorable effects of stimulants on oppositional behavior, anger
outbursts, and aggression in youths, with or without comorbid ADHD.
The doses of stimulants used for aggression are similar to those used for
ADHD. An extended-­release α2-­adrenergic agonist (guanfacine) is efficacious for oppositionality comorbid with ADHD, with a dose of 1-­4 mg/
day, dosed according to weight. There is evidence for efficacy of risperidone in reducing aggression and conduct problems in children age 5-­18
years. The suggested usual daily dose of risperidone for severe aggression
is 1.5-­2 mg for children and 2-­4 mg for adolescents, titrating up as needed
and tolerated from starting doses of 0.25 mg (children) or 0.5 mg (adolescents). The use of this class of medication should be reserved for severe
presentations in which the safety of self and/or others is compromised.
Medication trials should be systematic, and the duration of trials should
be sufficient (generally 6-­8 weeks for atypical antipsychotics; shorter for
stimulants and α-­agonists) to determine the agent’s effectiveness. The
short-­term goal of medication treatment is to achieve at least a 50% reduction in aggressive symptoms, as assessed by a focused symptom rating
scale (see Table 42.4); the ultimate goal is to achieve symptom remission
(below clinical cutpoint on the rating scale). A second medication of the
same class can be considered if there is insufficient evidence of response
to the maximal tolerated dose. Care should be taken to avoid unnecessary
polypharmacy, in part by discontinuing agents that have not demonstrated
significant benefit. Discontinuation of the medication should be considered after a symptom-­free interval.

LEVEL OF CARE

Most children and adolescents with a behavior disorder can be safely
and effectively treated in the outpatient setting. Youths with intractable
CD may benefit from residential or specialized foster care treatment,
where more intensive treatments can be provided.

Chapter 43

Tantrums and Breath-­
Holding Spells
Keneisha R. Sinclair-­McBride, Erica H. Lee,
David R. DeMaso, and Heather J. Walter
Temper tantrums are common during early childhood. They are
typically developmentally normative expressions of children’s frustration with their own limitations or anger about not being able to get
their way. It is important for parents to recognize the different triggers for tantrums to determine the best course of action to prevent
or manage this behavior as it arises. Dealing with tantrum behavior
can become very frustrating for parents and these feelings should be
validated, while also helping make sure parents are aware that many
tantrums can be averted by awareness or attunement to certain cues
given by their child. In particular, parents should be aware that when
a child is tired, hungry, or has to make a transition, it can be expected
that the child will be more likely to have a tantrum because limit
setting or unmet expectations may feel particularly overwhelming
in these circumstances. In this case, it is advised that parents plan
ahead and take a preventive stance by being aware of triggers and
minimizing the potential for a tantrum. Parents should not make a
tired or hungry child accompany them on an extended outing unless
absolutely necessary. Additionally, depending on the child’s developmental level, it is helpful to have a clear discussion ahead of time
about the expectations in certain scenarios. An example of setting
expectations to help prevent a tantrum is: “When we go into the store
I need you to (1) stay with me, (2) keep your hands to yourself, and
(3) not whine for treats. If you can do these three things, we can
pick one treat to bring home.” When children are able to demonstrate
good control, their behavior should be acknowledged, praised, and
rewarded when appropriate. This will increase the likelihood that
they will engage in the desired response more often, even in situations they find frustrating.
When children tantrum as an expression of anger or sadness in
not getting their way, parents may feel inclined to give in or respond
to the negative behavior with yelling or threats. Unfortunately, these
responses can reinforce and even escalate the oppositional behavior.
Parents should attempt to avert defiance by giving the child choices
(e.g., you can walk to the car on your own two feet or I can carry you).
Active ignoring can be used for mild tantrum behaviors because paying attention, even negative attention, can be reinforcing. If a child
is tantruming in a way that is unsafe, they can be removed from the
unsafe situation and given a consequence by being placed in time-­out.
If the tantrum was to avoid a task, the child should be required to complete the task once time-­out is over.
Breath-­holding spells occasionally occur during a tantrum and can
be frightening to parents. These are reflexive events in which the crying
child becomes apneic, pale, or cyanotic, may lose consciousness, and
occasionally will have a brief seizure. Parents are best advised to ignore

281

breath holding during a tantrum once it has started. Without reinforcement, breath-­holding generally disappears.
Subtypes of breath-­holding spells include cyanotic, pallid, or mixed
episodes. Cyanotic spells are the dominant type. Pallid spells may be
similar to vasovagal-­related syncopal events in older children and
may be initiated by similar stimuli. Iron deficiency with or without
anemia may be present, and some children with breath-­holding spells
respond to iron therapy. There is no increased risk of seizure disorders
in children who have had a short seizure during a breath-­holding spell.
Medical conditions to rule-­out in breath-­holding spells (usually pallid)
include seizures, Chiari crisis, familial dysautonomia, cardiac arrhythmias, cataplexy, hereditary hyperekplexia, and other central nervous
system lesions.
The first key to the management of temper tantrums and breath-­
holding spells is to help parents intervene before the child is highly
distressed. The parent can be instructed to calmly remind the child of
the expected behavior and the potential consequence if the expected
behavior does not occur. In addition, distraction to another activity or
conversation may help. If the child does not comply, he or she should
be placed in time-­out for a period approximating 1 min for each year
of age. Parents should state the reason the child is being placed in time-­
out beforehand in a calm and neutral tone, but they should not discuss
the reasons during time-­out. Once the time-­out is over and the child is
calm, it may be helpful for parents to discuss with the child the reasons
for the child’s frustration and their expectations for how the child will
respond in the future.
Time-­out can be effectively used in children up to approximately 10
years of age. Parents should also be advised to be mindful of their own
reactions to their child’s tantrum behavior to avoid an escalation of the
child’s behavior caused by an angry parental response.
If behavioral measures such as time-­out fail, pediatricians must
assess other aspects of parent–child interactions, such as the frequency
of positive interactions, the consistency of parental responses to child
behavior, and the ways that parents handle anger, before making further recommendations. In the absence of frequent positive parent–
child interactions, time-­out may not be effective, and inconsistent
responding to problem behavior increases the likelihood of the negative behavior continuing. Children can be frightened by the intensity of
their own angry feelings and by angry feelings they arouse in their parents. Parents should model the anger control that they want their children to exhibit. Some parents are unable to see that if they lose control
themselves, their own angry behavior does not help their children to
behave differently. Advising parents to calmly provide simple choices
will help the child to feel more in control and to develop a sense of
autonomy. Providing the child with options also typically helps reduce
the child’s feelings of anger and shame, which can later have adverse
effects on social and emotional development. Providing choice also
reduces power struggles between the parent and child and can aid in
enhancing the parent–child relationship and building problem-­solving
skills.
When tantrum behavior, including breath holding, does not respond
to parent coaching or is accompanied by head banging or high levels of
aggression, referral for a mental health evaluation is indicated. Further
evaluation is also recommended if tantrum behavior persists into the
latency period and preteen years.

Chapter 44

Lying, Stealing, and
Truancy
Keneisha R. Sinclair-­McBride, Erica H. Lee,
David R. DeMaso, and Heather J. Walter
Young children lie for a multitude of reasons. Lies for this age group can
be considered developmentally normative attempts at understanding language, communication, rules, and expectations. In early childhood, lying
often occurs as a child experiments with language. By observing the reactions of parents, preschoolers learn about expectations for honesty in communication. Lying can also be a form of fantasy for children, who often
describe things as they wish them to be rather than as they are. To avoid
an unpleasant confrontation, a child who has not followed a rule or met an
expectation may lie. At this stage, children often do not understand that
lying only postpones a confrontation. Parents should keep in mind that
lying behavior in this age group is rarely malicious or premeditated.
In older children, lying is generally an effort to cover up actions that do
not fit into the child’s conceptualization of themselves. Children in this
age group may lie as an attempt to maintain self-­esteem. Of course, lying
is also often used to avoid a negative consequence for misbehavior. Older
children are also more likely to intentionally leave out critical parts of a
story in an attempt to deceive or avoid a negative consequence. Lying can
also be promoted by poor adult modeling. Many children and adolescents lie to avoid adults’ disapproval. If children and teens are responded
to in harsh and punitive ways, they may lie to avoid this. Alternatively,
lying may be used as a method of rebellion, especially in adolescence.
Lying about forbidden activities, social media use, or other behaviors may
be an attempt to continue to break the rules without detection. Chronic
lying can occur in combination with several other antisocial behaviors
and is a sign of underlying psychopathology or family dysfunction.
Parents should address lying by giving the child a clear message of what
is acceptable. Sensitivity and support combined with limit setting are necessary for a successful intervention. Although habitual lying can become
frustrating for parents, they should be discouraged from making accusations or focusing on catching their child in a lie and instead should work
toward creating an atmosphere that makes it easier for their child to tell the
truth. Parents should let the child know that telling the truth about a difficult situation will allow the parents to help them better problem-­solve the
issue at hand. Should a situation arise where a child has lied and the parents
are aware of the true details, the lie should be confronted while providing
the facts of what is known and also stating the desired or expected behavior. This should be done in a calm, neutral manner. For example, if a parent
is aware that a child played video games instead of doing homework and
the child denies it, the parent can state, “I notice that your homework is
incomplete and that you are playing without permission. Our rule is that
you complete homework first. There will be no more video games for the
rest of the week.” This response reminds the child how he can meet his
goals in an acceptable way and an appropriate consequence can then be
given. Parents should be encouraged to address the expectations for their
home and children in a family meeting or in regular discussions with their
child outside the context of the child’s lying.
Regardless of age or developmental level, when lying becomes a
common way of managing conflict, intervention is warranted. If this
behavior cannot be resolved through the parents’ understanding of the
situation and the child’s understanding that lying is not a reasonable
alternative, a mental health evaluation is indicated.

STEALING

Many children steal something at some point in their lives. Often, when
very young children steal, the behavior is an impulsive action to acquire
something they want. A common example is the child who takes candy
or a toy from the store shelf. If a parent notices this behavior, they can

use the situation as a teaching opportunity to explain that community and
family expectations are that we have to pay for things at the store and not
take them without permission. It should not be expected that a very young
child will be aware of all the rules around shopping or stealing. It may also
be difficult for a child who has been used to being able to freely take whatever she wants to be aware of all the expected behaviors across different settings. When preschoolers and school-­age children begin to steal frequently
even after they have been told not to, the behavior may be a response to
stressful environmental circumstances and requires further exploration
and evaluation.
For some older children, stealing can be an expression of anger or
revenge for perceived frustrations with parents or other authority figures.
In such instances, stealing becomes one way the child and adolescent can
manipulate and attempt to control their world. Stealing can also be learned
from adults. Some children will report that the behavior is “exciting” for
them, and they may also engage in the behavior for peer approval. In some
cases, youth living in poverty may engage in the behavior as a survival
mechanism.
Kleptomania, an impulse-­control disorder, may begin in adolescence and is characterized by an intense impulse to steal objects that
may not be rationally needed by the patient. There are often comorbid disorders such as anxiety, eating disorders, substance misuse, and
depression. Treatment includes cognitive-­behavioral therapy (CBT)
in addition to various drugs such as lithium, naltrexone, and selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
Parents should work with their children to rectify stealing through
restitution. Parents should require that their child return stolen items
or pay for them with their own money (i.e., allowance or gift money).
When this is not possible, another reasonable consequence should be
given, such as losing a privilege or completing additional chores. When
stealing is part of a pattern of broader conduct problems, referral for a
mental health evaluation is warranted.

TRUANCY

Truancy and running away are never developmentally appropriate.
Truancy may represent an unsafe environment of disorganization
within the home including lack of appropriate supervision or older
children being required to caretake for younger siblings. Truancy can
also be a sign of developing conduct problems or behavioral health
problems including depression or anxiety. When truancy occurs in
younger children, there are usually psychosocial concerns with the
parents or adult caretakers in the home that prevent them from following through with the required demands of getting their children to
school each day. Families struggling with housing and food insecurity
may have difficulties having their children attend school regularly. Parents with intellectual disability or their own mental health or substance
abuse problems may become overwhelmed with managing the home
and caring for their children; thus they might not consistently ensure
their child gets to school. In addition, children might decide to remain
at home to take care of parents who are impaired.
Truancy is more common in preteens and adolescents and can be a
function of multiple factors, including but not limited to learning difficulties, social anxiety, depression, traumatic exposure, bullying, peer
pressure, and substance use. In any of these cases, the child should be
referred for further evaluation to assess the barriers to returning to
school. Best practices for dealing with truancy resulting from school
avoidance and anxiety include addressing the underlying psychologic
symptoms causing the school avoidance and empowering parents, children, and school staff to work on a consistent plan for a return to school.
Younger children may threaten running away out of frustration or a
desire to “get back at” parents. Older children who run away are almost
always expressing a serious underlying problem within themselves or
their family, including violence, abuse, and neglect. Adolescent runaways
are at high risk for substance abuse and other risk-­taking behaviors as
well as at risk for being victims of abuse (e.g., sexual exploitation).
Youth exhibiting truancy or running away should be referred for a
mental health evaluation.

Chapter 45

Aggression
Keneisha R. Sinclair-­McBride, Erica H. Lee,
David R. DeMaso, and Heather J. Walter

Aggressive behavior is a serious symptom associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Early intervention is indicated for
persistent aggressive behavior given that children may not simply
“grow out of ” this pattern of behavior. Aggressive tendencies are
heritable, although environmental factors can promote aggression
in susceptible children. Both enduring and temporary stressors
affecting a family can increase aggressive behavior in children.
Aggression in childhood is correlated with both poverty and chaotic
family situations, including chronic unemployment, family discord,
and exposure to community and domestic violence, criminality,
and psychiatric disorders. Children born to teenage mothers and
parents with limited resources and support are also at risk. Males
are reported to be more aggressive than females. A difficult temperament and later aggressiveness are related. When children with
temperament difficulties are responded to with punitive discipline
strategies within the family environment, it can set up a cycle of
increasing aggression. Aggressive children often misinterpret social
cues in such a way that they perceive hostile intent in ambiguous
or benign interactions, and then may react with verbal or physical
aggression toward peers and parents.
It is important to differentiate the causes and motives for childhood aggression. Intentional aggression may be primarily instrumental (i.e., to achieve an end), primarily hostile (i.e., to inflict
physical or psychologic pain), or primarily impulsive. Impulsive
aggression can often be effectively managed with simple behavioral
interventions at home. Children who are callous, not empathetic,
and more consistently aggressive require intervention in the specialty mental health setting (see Chapter 42). These children are at
high risk for suspension from school and eventual school failure.
Because learning disorders are common in this population, aggressive children should be referred for screening. Aggressive behavior is often present in a variety of other psychologic conditions,
including attention-­deficit/hyperactivity and oppositional defiant,
intermittent explosive, conduct, and disruptive mood dysregulation
disorders (see Chapters 39 and 42).
Aggressive behavior in males is relatively consistent from the preschool period through adolescence. Without effective intervention,
a male with a high level of aggressive behavior between 3 and 6
years of age has a high probability of carrying this behavior into
adolescence. The developmental progression of aggression among
females is less well studied. Fewer females show physically aggressive behavior in early childhood. However, interpersonal coercive
behavior, especially in peer relationships, is seen in females. This
behavior may be related to the development of physical aggression
for females in adolescence (e.g., fighting) or other conduct problems (e.g., stealing).
Children exposed to aggressive models on television, in video games,
or in play have more aggressive behavior compared with children not
exposed to these models. Parents’ anger and aggressive or harsh punishment can model behavior that children may imitate when they are
physically or psychologically hurt. Parents’ abuse may be transmitted
to the next generation by several modes: children imitate aggression

283

that they have witnessed; abuse can cause neurologic damage, which
itself predisposes the child to violence; and internalized rage often
results from abuse.
Aggressive behavior in youth is often oriented toward peers
through bullying (see Chapter 15.1). Although it is developmentally
normative for children to engage in some teasing behavior, bullying
has a more serious tone. Bullying is defined as unwanted aggressive
behavior in which there is a real or perceived imbalance of power
or strength between the bully and the victim. Typically, it involves
a pattern of behavior repeated over time. Although most often perceived as physical aggression, bullying can take on a variety of forms,
including relational bullying, the most common form engaged in by
females. Cyberbullying is a particular risk during the middle and
high school years because of increased exposure and access to multiple social media platforms at this developmental stage. Parents
should be advised to closely monitor their child’s social media and
maintain open communication with their children. Children may
bully others because of impulse-­control and social skills deficits,
strong need for power and negative dominance, satisfaction in causing harm to others, or psychologic or material rewards. Children
who bully are at risk for a variety of negative school and psychologic
outcomes.
Victims of bullying are particularly at risk for negative outcomes,
especially if the behavior is not addressed by adults. Victimization
experiences are associated with school avoidance and school dropout, social isolation, somatic symptoms, and increased psychologic
problems such as depression and anxiety. There have been numerous cases of suicide in children who reported a prior history of
being bullied. Should a concern arise around bullying in the school
setting, parents should be advised to reach out to their child’s
teacher, school counselor, and school administrative staff to have
the bullying behavior addressed. Many schools also have a bullying
intervention protocol that can be implemented, and state departments of education have antibullying policies with formal protocols to address concerns. Given the significant psychologic risks
for both victims and perpetrators of bullying, it is essential that all
children who are persistently involved in these incidents be referred
for mental health evaluation.

Self-­Injurious Behavior
Kiera M. James and Molly C. Adrian
Self-­
injurious behaviors, or deliberate engagement in self-­
inflicted
harm, comprise both suicidal behaviors and nonsuicidal self-­injury
(NSSI) (see Chapter 40). NSSI, specifically, involves intentional self-­
inflicted damage to bodily tissue without the intent to die, though it
can unintentionally result in significant harm or even death.
Suicidal behaviors and NSSI are both transdiagnostic behaviors occurring
in the context of numerous psychiatry disorders as well as in the absence of
any diagnosis at all. Nonetheless, the vast majority of youth who engage in
NSSI meet diagnostic criteria for a psychiatry disorder. Self-­injurious behavior may also be associated with developmental disabilities often as a manifestation of stereotypic movement disorder (Chapter 37.2).

284 Part III u Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders
Although NSSI and suicidal behavior are distinct constructs
based on the intent of the behavior, they are also highly comorbid.
Research exploring the attitudes of youth who have engaged in NSSI
indicates that there is a strong identification with suicide and death
for this population, which makes NSSI a significant clinical issue
and risk factor that cannot be ignored or minimized. Although
some youth engage in repeated NSSI without ever attempting suicide, studies suggest that 50–75% of adolescents who have a history
of NSSI will make a suicide attempt at some point.
NSSI has been documented in children as young as 7 years of age,
with rates increasing from childhood (∼8%) to adolescents (∼18%),
and decreasing during adulthood (∼5.5%). Although traditionally
thought to be more prevalent in females than males, NSSI occurs in
both sexes. Emerging research suggests that, if present at all, gender
differences in rates of NSSI are more likely in clinical than community populations. Notably, however, rates of NSSI are particularly
high among transgender and gender nonconforming teens with up
to 55% reporting past-­year engagement in NSSI. There are no significant ethnicity or class differences among youth who engage in
NSSI. Youth identified as those with the highest risk include females
ages 15-­19 and males 20-­24.
Cutting is the most commonly reported form of NSSI. For those
youth who engage in NSSI for the first time, approximately 20% will
repeat the behavior within the same year; cutting is the most commonly repeated method of NSSI. Other methods of NSSI include
scratching, burning, carving, piercing, hitting or punching, biting,
picking at wounds, and digging nails into the skin. The most common areas of injury are the arms, legs, and torso, though NSSI may
also occur on other parts of the body (e.g., breasts, genitals, groin,
neck). Objects used in cutting include razors, scissors, broken glass,
hard plastic, knives, staples, paper clips, or any other objects sharp
enough to cause injury. Importantly, there are gender differences
in methods such that females are more likely to engage in cutting,
scratching, biting, hair pulling, and wound picking whereas males
are more likely to engage in burning and self-­battery, including hitting and head banging.
Youth often report exposure to NSSI before engaging in the
behavior. Some youth report that they have friends who self-­injure
(e.g., cut) to attempt to alleviate negative emotions. Others may
view stories of their peers’ engagement in NSSI on websites and
social media. Impressionable youth have also reported learning
about NSSI for the first time from celebrities who have engaged in
the behavior.
NSSI is associated with depression, anxiety, peer (bullying) victimization, social isolation, low self-­esteem, substance abuse, eating disorders,
impulsivity, poor school performance, delinquency, and neglectful or
highly punitive parenting practices, as well as trauma, including a history of physical or sexual abuse. The behavior may begin as an impulsive
response to internal distress for younger children, but for those who are
older, the behavior can take on a self-­reinforcing function. Youth may feel
a sense of relief or mastery over negative emotions once the behavior has
been completed. Some youth report that they engage in NSSI when feeling intense negative emotions, overwhelmed, or panicked to regulate their
emotions. Others engage in the behavior when they are feeling numb, to
“feel something” again. NSSI may also serve as a distraction from emotional pain, provide a sense of control over the body, or be used as a form
of self-­punishment for a perceived wrongdoing. NSSI may also function to
communicate distress or strength or provide peer group affiliation. Youth
often report that they are unable to resist the urge to engage in the behavior
and will continue to feel increasing levels of distress until they engage in
NSSI. Others plan or schedule the behavior, building it into their routine.
Youth who view NSSI as an effective, private, and necessary coping strategy tend to have more dependence on the behavior and more resistance to
stopping it.
Some adolescents and young adults engage in repeated NSSI for
years without disclosing the behavior. Due to the shame associated

with this stigmatized behavior, youth will often go to great lengths
to keep it a secret. Some wear bracelets to cover scars on their arms
or wear long sleeves in summer to hide the scarring. They report
feeling ashamed of the behavior and fear rejection or disappointment from family and friends should they find out. At times, fear of
being rejected or a disappointment to others can increase feelings
of depression and anxiety and can serve to perpetuate the behavior.
In contrast, others are more open about showing their scars and
sharing their behavior with others. In either case, the behavior is a
way to communicate or manage some level of distress. Many youth
who engage in NSSI may never be seen in a hospital emergency
department or by a mental health professional. Factors that protect against engagement in NSSI include a lack of awareness of,
or exposure to, NSSI; an aversion to physical pain; an aversion to
NSSI-­related stimuli (e.g., blood); a positive view of the self; the
use of other more adaptive emotion regulation strategies; and social
norms. Youth with repetitive NSSI should be referred to behavioral
health services. Effective treatment strategies include conducting a
functional analysis around NSSI behavior, identifying and teaching alternative emotion regulation strategies, and reducing access to
means to harm oneself. Reduction of NSSI has been observed with
dialectical behavior therapy for adolescents, cognitive-­behavioral
therapy, cognitive analytic therapy, and mentalization-­based therapy for adolescents. There are no psychopharmacologic treatments
that have demonstrated efficacy; thus behavioral approaches should
be prioritized.
Parents should be advised to monitor youth social media access
and be aware of their peer group. Maintaining open communication
can assist parents in recognizing an increase in concerning behaviors or patterns of behaviors. Parents should talk with their child
about strategies for managing strong emotions and provide emotion
coaching to support their child through experiences of distress. They
should also be encouraged to talk with their child about their use of
and exposure to drugs and alcohol as substance use can be associated
with NSSI. Learning that their child has been engaging in self-­injury
can be frightening for parents because they are unsure of what to do
or why their child is engaging in this behavior. It is important that
parents receive psychoeducation about NSSI to reduce common misconceptions that make it difficult to understand their child’s engagement in NSSI and respond effectively. Such information should be
digestible and accurate, including written suggestions and examples.
Parents should also seek mental health services for their child. It is
recommended that the child receive a full assessment for risk of suicide
when NSSI is a concern.
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth
Edition (DSM-­5) has classified NSSI as a condition requiring further study before consideration for possible placement in forthcoming editions of DSM. Proposed diagnostic criteria include
self-­inflicted injury without suicidal intent occurring on 5 or more
days in the past year, with lack of suicidal intent either stated by the
individual or inferred by the individual’s repeated engagement in a
behavior not likely to result in death. The individual expects that
the self-­injurious behavior will relieve a negative feeling or thought,
resolve an interpersonal difficulty, or induce a positive feeling state.
The self-­injurious behavior is associated with interpersonal difficulties or negative feelings or thoughts, preoccupation with the
intended behavior that is difficult to control, or frequent thoughts
about the intended behavior. The proposed criteria also specify
that the behavior is not socially sanctioned (e.g., body piercing,
tattooing) and is not restricted to skin picking or nail biting. The
behavior must be associated with significant distress or functional
impairment.

Chapter 47 u Childhood Psychoses

Chapter 47

Childhood Psychoses
Jennifer A. Zaspel and Rosa K. Kim
Psychosis is a severe disruption of thought, perception, and behavior resulting in loss of reality testing. Psychosis can occur as part
of a mood disorder, such as major depressive disorder or bipolar
I disorder; between mood disorder episodes, as in schizoaffective
disorder; or without mood disorder episodes, as in schizophrenia.
Transient psychotic episodes can arise during times of psychologic
or physiologic stress in patients who are vulnerable because of personality, developmental, or genetic disorders. Positive symptoms,
including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and
grossly disorganized behavior, are key features that define psychoses across disorders, likely because of shared pathophysiologic
mechanisms. Negative symptoms, on the other hand, are most
typical of schizophrenia.
Delusions are fixed, unchangeable, false beliefs held despite conflicting evidence. They may include a variety of themes, including
persecutory, referential (the belief that irrelevant events or details
in the world are related directly to oneself), somatic, religious,
and grandiose. Delusions are considered bizarre if they are clearly
implausible. Hallucinations are vivid, clear, perceptual disturbances that occur without external stimulus and have the full force
and impact of normal perceptions. They may occur in any sensory
modality; auditory hallucinations are the most common associated
with psychosis. Disorganized thinking is inferred from an individual’s speech by examining their thought process and thought
content and is typically severe enough to impair one’s ability to
communicate. Grossly disorganized behavior may range from
childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation to catatonic behavior.
Negative symptoms include diminished emotional expression, avolition (decreased drive to perform purposeful tasks), alogia (lack
of speech), anhedonia, and social withdrawal. Negative symptoms
account for a substantial portion of the long-­term morbidity associated with schizophrenia.
Given the centrality of hallucinations and delusions in making a
diagnosis of a psychotic illness, their differentiation from developmentally normal fantasy is essential. When children are imagining, they
control the fantasy and do not have the perceptual experience of seeing and hearing. When children are hallucinating, they do not control
the hallucination. Almost two thirds of children will endorse at least
one psychotic-­like experience, most often a hallucination. When not
persistent or accompanied by distress, these experiences are not usually a cause for concern. The largest population-­based study to date
evaluating psychotic symptoms and neurocognition in youth 11-­21
years old found that those who endorsed more psychotic-­like experiences than is typical for their age had reduced accuracy across neurocognitive domains, reduced global functioning, and increased risk of
depression, anxiety, behavioral disorders, substance use, and suicidal
ideation. Thus psychotic-­like symptoms that are frequent, distressing,
and cause impairment signal a need for further evaluation and monitoring; however, only a small minority of these children will develop
persisting psychotic illnesses.

47.1 Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders
Jennifer A. Zaspel and Rosa K. Kim
Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders as described
in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth
Edition (DSM-­
5) include brief psychotic disorder, schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, substance/

285

medication-­induced psychotic disorder, psychotic disorder caused
by another medical condition, catatonia associated with another
mental disorder, catatonic disorder due to another medical condition, unspecified catatonia, delusional disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, and other specified/unspecified schizophrenia spectrum
and other psychotic disorders.

DESCRIPTION

The schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders are primarily characterized by the presence of symptoms of psychosis, specifically delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, or grossly
disorganized or catatonic behavior, and negative symptoms. Brief
psychotic disorder is characterized by the duration of one or more
of these symptoms for at least 1 day but less than 1 month followed
by complete resolution. Emergence of symptoms may or may not
be preceded by an identifiable stressor (Table 47.1). Although brief,
the level of impairment in this disorder may be severe enough that
supervision is required to ensure that basic needs are met and that
the individual is protected from the consequences of poor judgment
and cognitive impairment.
If two or more psychotic symptoms persist for between 1 and 6
months, the condition is called schizophreniform disorder (Table
47.2). To meet DSM-­5 criteria for schizophrenia, two or more psychotic symptoms must have been present for a significant portion
of time for at least 1 month (unless suppressed by treatment), and
the level of psychosocial functioning must either be markedly below
the level achieved before the onset or there is failure to achieve the
expected level of functioning. In addition, there must be continuous
signs of the disturbance for at least 6 months (Table 47.3).
Individuals with schizophrenia can display inappropriate affect,
dysphoric mood, disturbed sleep patterns, and lack of interest in
eating, or food refusal. Depersonalization, derealization, somatic
concerns, and anxiety and phobias are common. Cognitive deficits
are observed, including decrements in declarative memory, working memory, language function, and other executive functions, as
well as slower processing speed. These individuals may have no

insight or awareness of their disorder, which is a predictor of nonadherence to treatment, higher relapse rates, and poorer prognosis. Hostility and aggression can be associated with schizophrenia,
although spontaneous or random assault is uncommon. Aggression
is more frequent for younger males and for individuals with a history of violence, nonadherence with treatment, substance abuse,
and impulsivity.
The essential features of schizophrenia are the same in childhood
as in adulthood, but it is more difficult to make the diagnosis. In children, delusions and hallucinations may be less elaborate, visual hallucinations may be more common, and disorganized speech may be
better attributed to an autism spectrum or communication disorder.
In youth with schizophrenia, the most frequent psychotic symptoms
are auditory hallucinations (82%), delusions (78%), thought disorder
(66%), disorganized or bizarre behavior (53%), and negative symptoms (50%). Childhood-­onset schizophrenia tends to represent a more
severe form of the disorder spectrum, with more genetic risk factors,
more brain abnormalities, and more prominent prepsychotic developmental disorders.

EPIDEMIOLOGY

Brief psychotic disorder is reported to account for 9% of first-­onset
psychosis in the United States and is more common in females than
males. The incidence of schizophreniform disorders in the United
States appears as much as fivefold less than that of schizophrenia.
The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia is approximately 0.3–0.7%,
although variations are reported by race/ethnicity, across countries, and by geographic origin for immigrants. The male-­to-­female
ratio is approximately 1.4:1. Males generally have poorer premorbid adjustment, lower educational achievement, more prominent
negative symptoms, and more cognitive impairment than females.

3.	Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or

4.	Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior
5.	Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expression or

B.	For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the
disturbance, level of functioning in one or more major areas, such

the level achieved before the onset (or when the onset is in
childhood or adolescence, there is failure to achieve expected
level of interpersonal, academic, or occupational functioning).
C.	Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 mo.
This 6 mo period must include at least 1 mo of symptoms (or less

symptoms. During these prodromal or residual periods, the signs of
the disturbance may be manifested by only negative symptoms or by
two or more symptoms listed in Criterion A present in an attenuated
form (e.g., odd beliefs, unusual perceptual experiences).
D.	Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with
psychotic features have been ruled out because either (1) no
major depressive or manic episodes have occurred concurrently
with the active-­phase symptoms or (2) if mood episodes have

Childhood (preadolescent)-­onset is exceedingly rare, with an incidence of less than 0.04%, and 2:1 ratio in males versus females.

CLINICAL COURSE

Brief psychotic disorder most often appears in adolescence or early
adulthood, with the average age of onset in the mid-­30s but can
occur throughout the life span. A diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder requires full remission within 1 month of onset and gradual
return to premorbid level of function. The age of onset of schizophreniform disorder is similar to that of schizophrenia. Recovery from an episode of the disorder is within 6 months; however,
about 65% of patients relapse and eventually receive a diagnosis of
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Abrupt onset, confusion,
absence of blunted affect, and good premorbid functioning predict
a better outcome in schizophreniform disorder.
Schizophrenia typically develops between the late teens and the
mid-­30s; onset before adolescence is rare. The peak age at onset for
the first psychotic episode is in the early to mid-­20s for males and
in the late 20s for females. The onset may be abrupt or insidious,
but most individuals manifest a slow and gradual development of
symptoms, with about 50% of individuals complaining of depressive symptoms. The predictors of course and outcome are largely
unexplained. The course is favorable in approximately 20% of
cases; a small number of individuals are reported to recover completely. However, many remain chronically ill, with exacerbations
and remissions of active symptoms, whereas others experience

Chapter 47 u Childhood Psychoses
progressive deterioration. Most individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia require some form of daily living support. Positive symptoms tend to diminish over time, and negative symptoms are the
most persistent, along with cognitive deficits.
It is important to recognize hallmark phases in the assessment
and management of schizophrenia. In the prodrome phase, most
patients experience functional deterioration over the course of
months (e.g., social withdrawal, idiosyncratic preoccupations,
unusual behaviors, academic failure, deteriorating self-­care skills,
and/or dysphoria) before the onset of overt psychotic symptoms.
The acute phase is characterized by prominent positive symptoms and deterioration in functioning and is the phase in which
most patients present for care. During the recovery phase, negative symptoms and disorganization may persist as active psychosis
remits. The residual phase has minimal to no positive symptoms,
although negative symptoms may cause continued impairment.
Some patients will experience chronic impairment despite adequate treatment.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

The differential diagnosis for the psychotic disorders is broad and
includes reactions to substances/medications (dextromethorphan,
LSD, hallucinogenic mushrooms, psilocybin, peyote, cannabis,
stimulants, inhalants, corticosteroids, anesthetics, anticholinergics, antihistamines, amphetamines); medical conditions causing
psychotic-­like symptoms (Table 47.4; see Table 32.4); and other psychiatric disorders (depressive, bipolar, obsessive-­compulsive, factitious, body dysmorphic, posttraumatic stress, autism spectrum,

287

communication, personality). The differential diagnosis can be difficult because many conditions that can be mistaken for psychosis
also increase the risk for it.
There are many indications that suggest psychotic symptoms may
be related to a physical illness rather than a primarily psychiatric illness (Table 47.5). When psychotic symptoms are caused by identifiable medical conditions, there are often impairments in attention,
orientation, recent memory, and intellectual function. Hallucinations associated with medical illness are more often tactile or visual,
whereas auditory hallucinations are more common in primary psychotic disorders. Patients whose hallucinations are caused by medical illness are more likely to recognize that they do represent reality.
A positive family or prior personal history of psychosis or other
serious psychiatric illnesses is less likely to be present.
Autoimmune encephalitis caused by anti–N-­methyl-­d-­aspartate
(NMDA) receptor or other autoantibodies may manifest with
psychosis, anxiety, depression, agitation, aggression, delusions,
catatonia, visual or auditory hallucinations, disorientation, and
paranoia in combination with sleep disturbances, autonomic dysfunction, dyskinesias, movement disorders, seizures, memory loss,
and a depressed level of consciousness (Fig. 47.1; see Table 32.5).
The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and MRI are usually, but not always,
abnormal. The constellation of a relatively rapid onset psychosis
and encephalitic features should suggest the diagnosis, although at
presentation, behavioral problems may be the dominant feature (see
Chapter 638.4; Table 47.6). A small number of patients present with
purely psychiatric symptoms without other neurologic findings.
Determining when identifiable medical conditions are causing delirium with prominent psychotic symptoms may be difficult

and is more fully explored in Chapter 48. In general, delirium is
hallmarked by fluctuating levels of consciousness and is often associated with abnormalities in the neurologic exam and vital signs.
Psychosis may be present in patients with delirium, but it will be
accompanied by clear signs and symptoms of physical illness.
The diagnosis of a psychotic disorder should be made only after
other explanations for the observed symptoms have been thoroughly considered. Mistakenly diagnosing psychosis when it is not
present can lead to inappropriate use of antipsychotics with their
attendant risks. The persistence, frequency, and form of possible
psychotic symptoms, as well as the degree of accompanying distress
and functional regression, need to be considered in determining the
likelihood of an underlying psychotic pathophysiology.

Table 47.6  Proposed Diagnostic Criteria for Autoimmune
Psychosis
For a diagnosis of possible autoimmune psychosis:
The patient must have current psychotic symptoms of abrupt onset
(rapid progression of <3 months) with at least one of the following:
• Currently or recently diagnosed with a tumor
• Movement disorder (catatonia or dyskinesia)
• Adverse response to antipsychotics, raising suspicion of neuroleptic
malignant syndrome (rigidity, hyperthermia, or raised creatine kinase)
• Severe or disproportionate cognitive dysfunction
• A decreased level of consciousness
• The occurrence of seizures that are not explained by a previously known
seizure disorder
• A clinically significant autonomic dysfunction (abnormal or unexpectedly
fluctuant blood pressure, temperature, or heart rate)

If a patient has possible autoimmune psychosis, they should be
investigated as per section 5 (“Consensus multimodal approach to
the systematic investigation of patients with suspected autoimmune
psychosis”), including electroencephalography, MRI, serum
autoantibodies, and CSF analysis (including CSF autoantibodies).
The results should lead to a diagnosis of non-­autoimmune
psychosis or probable/definite autoimmune psychosis.
For a diagnosis of probable autoimmune psychosis:
The patient must have current psychotic symptoms of abrupt onset
(rapid progression of <3 mo) with at least one of the seven clinical
criteria listed previously for possible autoimmune psychosis and at
least one of the following:
• CSF pleocytosis of >5 white blood cells/μL
• Bilateral brain abnormalities on T2 weighted fluid-­attenuated inversion
recovery MRI highly restricted to the medial temporal lobes
Or two of the following:
• Electroencephalogram encephalopathic changes (i.e., spikes, spike-­
wave activity, or rhythmic slowing [intermittent rhythmic delta or theta
activity] focal changes, or extreme delta brush
• CSF oligoclonal bands or increased IgG index
• The presence of a serum antineuronal antibody detected by cell-­based
assay

After exclusion of alternative diagnoses.
For a diagnosis of definite autoimmune psychosis:
The patient must meet the criteria for probable autoimmune
psychosis with IgG class antineuronal antibodies in CSF.
Note that these criteria do not exclude a diagnosis being made in
a patient with an acute onset (<3 mo) of psychosis, even if that
patient has had a previous psychotic, other psychiatric, or
encephalopathic episode that resolved.

Chapter 47 u Childhood Psychoses
COMORBIDITY

Among youth with schizophrenia, rates of comorbidity are approximately 34% for posttraumatic stress disorder, 34% for attention-­
deficit/hyperactivity and/or disruptive behavior disorders, and 32%
for substance abuse/dependence. At least 10–20% of children diagnosed with schizophrenia have intellectual delays; it is unclear if
this is related to the impact of the illness on cognitive testing. Children with schizophrenia also demonstrate impairments in language,
communication, and information processing. Co-occurring rates of
schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are higher than
would be expected in general populations; childhood-­onset schizophrenia has been linked to ASD, with an estimated 30–50% of cases
preceded by a diagnosis of an ASD.

SEQUELAE

Follow-­up studies of early-­onset schizophrenia suggest moderate to severe
impairment across the life span. Poor outcome is predicted by low premorbid functioning, insidious onset, higher rates of negative symptoms,
childhood onset, and low intellectual functioning. When followed into
adulthood, youth with schizophrenia demonstrated greater social deficits,
lower levels of employment, and lower likelihood of independent living,
relative to those with other childhood psychotic disorders.
Approximately 5–10% of individuals with schizophrenia die by
suicide or accidental death directly related to behaviors caused by
psychotic thinking, approximately 20% attempt suicide on one or
more occasions, and many more have suicidal ideation. Life expectancy is reduced in individuals with schizophrenia because of associated medical conditions; a shared vulnerability for psychosis and
medical disorders may explain some of the medical comorbidity of
schizophrenia.

ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS

Etiologic evidence for schizophrenia supports a neurodevelopmental
and neurodegenerative model, with multiple genetic and environmental risks having important roles. It has been hypothesized that although
psychotic disorders have their origins in early development, it is not
until youth are in their mid-­teens that the underlying neural structures manifest the disabling functional deficits and resultant psychotic
symptoms.

Genetic Factors

The lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia is 5-­20 times higher in
first-­degree relatives of affected probands than the general population. Concordance rates of 40–60% and 5–15% have been reported
in monozygotic and dizygotic twins, respectively. Genome-­wide
association studies have implicated variants in >100 different genes
that are statistically significant but individually only demonstrate
small increases in the risk for schizophrenia. The risk for schizophrenia increases with increasing burden of these risk alleles;
approximately 30% of the risk is attributable to common genetic
variants. Rare variants of larger effect have also been implicated as
increasing risk. Some rare copy number variants, where segments
of the genome encompassing many genes are either duplicated or
deleted, increase the risk of schizophrenia more markedly, with
odds ratios of 2-­25. Although these copy number variants may be
responsible for 0.5–1.0% of typical adolescent/adult-­onset schizophrenia, data indicate that they are responsible for about 12% of
schizophrenia cases with onset before age 13 years.

Environmental Factors

In utero exposure to maternal famine, advanced paternal age, prenatal infections, obstetric complications, marijuana use, and immigration have been hypothesized to contribute to the development of
schizophrenia. Cannabis use in teens is associated with a higher risk
of eventually developing psychosis, but it is difficult to determine
whether this is related to drug effects or an unmasking of underlying

289

disease potential. Environmental exposures may mediate disease
risk through direct neurologic damage, gene-­environment interactions, epigenetic effects, or de novo mutations. There is no evidence
that psychologic or social factors alone cause schizophrenia. Rather,
environmental factors potentially interact with biologic risk factors
to mediate the timing of onset, course, and severity of an acute episode. Expressed emotion within the family setting can influence the
onset and exacerbation of acute episodes and relapse rates.

NEUROANATOMIC ABNORMALITIES

Increased lateral ventricle volumes, along with reductions in hippocampus, thalamus, and frontal lobe volumes, have been reported in
schizophrenia. Youth with schizophrenia have reductions in gray matter volumes and reduced cortical folding. Neurotransmitter systems,
particularly central nervous system dopamine circuits, are hypothesized to have a key role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The
dopamine hypothesis is derived in part from the identification of D2
receptor blockade as the mechanism for the action of antipsychotic
medications. On neurologic exam, those with schizophrenia are often
found to have deficits in smooth-­pursuit eye movements and autonomic responsivity.

PREVENTION

There has been significant interest in prospectively identifying
youth at risk for schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders to provide early intervention before the development of a
chronic psychotic disorder. Those considered to be at clinically high
risk may express a variety of unusual or odd beliefs. They may have
unusual perceptual experiences, including frank hallucinations,
but retain insight into their unreality. Their speech and behavior
may be unusual, but not overtly disorganized. Individuals who had
been socially active may become withdrawn. The symptoms are
described as present at least once per week for the past month and
have begun or worsened over the past year. Although the symptoms are less severe and more transient than in a psychotic disorder,
20–40% of patients with these attenuated symptoms appear to go on
to a psychotic disorder within several years of symptom presentation. There is evidence that premorbid lower cognitive and social
skills as well as a history of substance abuse contribute to the risk of
developing a schizophrenia spectrum disorder.
Some evidence indicates that antipsychotic medication may delay
conversion to a psychotic disorder and ameliorate attenuated symptoms in active treatment, yet there appear to be no lasting effects after
the medication is withdrawn. Additionally, the known adverse effects
of antipsychotics argue against their being used broadly to prevent psychosis in these patients, given that about 65% do not go on to develop
a psychotic disorder.
Antidepressants have been associated with symptomatic
improvement in adolescents who are at risk of developing a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Psychologic interventions, including
social skills, cognitive, and interaction training programs, as well as
educational family interventions and cognitive-­behavioral therapy
(CBT), are reported to improve symptoms and psychosocial functioning in youth with early symptoms and decrease the rate of conversion to psychosis.
Despite improvements in diagnostic predictive validity, significant
concern remains regarding a high false-­positive rate that may cause
individuals to be stigmatized or exposed to unnecessary treatment. In
this context, youth with early symptoms suggestive of psychosis should
be referred to a child and adolescent psychiatrist or other qualified
mental health specialist.

SCREENING

There are no validated tools for screening for schizophrenia spectrum
disorders in children or adolescents. A widely accepted premorbid
phenotype for childhood-­onset schizophrenia has yet to be established.

Pediatric practitioners can make general inquiries of youth and
their parents regarding problems with thinking or perceptions,
including hallucinations and delusions. For younger children, the
clinician must ensure that the child understands the questions. True
psychotic symptoms are generally confusing to the individual. Highly
descriptive, detailed, organized, and situation-­specific reports are less
likely to represent true psychosis. Overt evidence of psychosis is not
always present on mental status examination, but in the absence of
this, the validity of symptom reports should be scrutinized. Given
the strong genetic component of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, a
thorough family history is key in supporting the workup of psychosis
in children. Youth presenting with possible psychosis warrant assessment and treatment by a child and adolescent psychiatrist or other
qualified mental health specialist.

ASSESSMENT

The diagnostic assessment of schizophrenia in youth is uniquely
complicated; misdiagnosis is common. Most children who report
hallucinations do not meet criteria for schizophrenia, and many do
not have a psychotic illness. The persistence, frequency, and form
of possible psychotic symptoms; the presence of distress; functional
impairment; and insight need to be considered in arriving at a diagnosis. Expertise in childhood psychopathology and experience in
assessing reports of psychotic symptoms in youth are important
prerequisite skills for clinicians evaluating youth for psychosis.
Comprehensive diagnostic assessments, which reconcile mental
status findings with the rigorous application of diagnostic criteria,
help improve accuracy.
All children who present with psychotic symptoms should receive
a thorough pediatric and neurologic evaluation to focus on ruling
out nonpsychiatric causes of psychosis (see Tables 47.4 and 32.4).
There is no neuroimaging or laboratory test that establishes a diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorders; these diagnostic tests
are instead used to further assist with the medical evaluation while
also establishing baseline laboratory parameters for monitoring
medication therapy. Routine laboratory testing typically includes
blood counts; basic metabolic panel; and assessment of liver, renal,
and thyroid function. More extensive evaluation is indicated for
atypical presentations, such as a gross deterioration in cognitive and
motor abilities, focal neurologic symptoms, or delirium (see Table
47.5). Neuroimaging may be indicated when neurologic deficits are
present, or EEG may be indicated for a clinical history suggestive
of seizures or encephalopathy. Toxicology screens are indicated for
acute onset or exacerbations of psychosis when exposure to drugs
of abuse cannot be ruled out. Genetic testing is indicated if there
are associated dysmorphic or syndromic features. Tests to rule out
specific syndromes or diseases are indicated for clinical presentations suggestive of a specific syndrome (e.g., amino acid screens
for inborn errors of metabolism, ceruloplasmin for Wilson disease,
porphobilinogen for acute intermittent porphyria, neuronal antibodies for autoimmune encephalitis). Neuropsychologic testing
cannot establish the diagnosis but may be important for documenting cognitive deficits for academic planning.

TREATMENT

Treatment goals include decreasing psychotic symptomatology, directing the child toward a developmentally typical trajectory, and reintegrating the child into the home and community. Children and families
facing schizophrenia spectrum disorders require an array of mental
health services to address their psychologic, social, educational, and

cultural needs. Given the insidious onset and chronic course of these
disorders, the patient must be followed longitudinally, with periodic
reassessment to hone diagnostic accuracy and tailor services to meet
the patient’s and family’s needs. Integrated psychopharmacologic, psychotherapeutic, psychoeducational, and case management services are
often necessary.
Psychoeducation about the illness with an assessment of the
potential role of stigma in treatment participation is critical for
improving adherence with treatment recommendations. Assessing
a child’s strengths and vulnerabilities as well as available environmental resources is critical in devising an effective treatment plan.
School and community liaison work to develop and maintain a day-­
to-­day schedule for the patient is important. Specialized educational
programs should be considered within the school system. Cognitive remediation has led to some promising gains in planning ability
and cognitive flexibility. Effective and collaborative communication
among the family, the pediatrician, a child and adolescent psychiatrist, and other mental health providers increases the potential for the
patient’s optimal functioning.

Pharmacotherapy

First-­generation (typical) and second-­generation (atypical) antipsychotic medications are effective in reducing psychotic symptoms.
Antipsychotics appear to outperform placebo and to have approximately equal effectiveness, except for ziprasidone and clozapine,
which may be less and more effective than the others, respectively.
Risperidone, aripiprazole, quetiapine, olanzapine, and lurasidone
are FDA-­approved second-­generation antipsychotics for treating
schizophrenia in patients 13 years and older, and paliperidone for
those 12 years and older. Several first-­generation antipsychotics
are also FDA-­approved for children and adolescents. The choice of
which agent to use first is typically based on FDA approval status,
side effect profile, patient and family preference, clinician familiarity, and cost. Although clozapine is effective in treating both
positive and negative symptoms, it has a risk for agranulocytosis
and seizures, which limits its use to those patients with treatment-­
resistant disorders. Ziprasidone and paliperidone are associated
with QT prolongation; this finding along with the inferior effectiveness of ziprasidone limits its use with children and adolescents. All
antipsychotics carry some degree of risk of sedation, weight gain,
and extrapyramidal symptoms (see Chapter 33).
Most patients require long-­term treatment and are at significant
risk of relapse if their medication is discontinued. However, more
than 75% of youth with schizophrenia discontinue their medication within 6 months. Common reasons for discontinuation include
lack of efficacy, intolerable side effects, and general lack of adherence with treatment plan. Many patients will continue to experience
some degree of positive or negative symptoms, requiring ongoing
treatment. Patients should maintain regular physician contact to
monitor symptom course, side effects, and adherence. Depot or
long-­acting injectable antipsychotics have not been studied well in
pediatric age groups and have inherent risks with long-­term exposure to adverse side effects. They are typically only considered when
there is a well-­documented history of psychotic symptoms as well as
poor medication adherence.

Electroconvulsive Therapy

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be used with severely impaired
adolescents if medications are either not helpful or cannot be tolerated. It has not been systematically studied in children, but its use is
supported in adults with schizophrenia, typically in combination with
antipsychotic therapy.

population is unknown, it is estimated that 7–25% of individuals
presenting with a first episode of psychosis meet criteria for this
diagnosis. Symptoms can be managed with antipsychotics until they
remit, which often happens shortly after the offending substance is
removed. Patients can develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder
following substance exposure, but this tends to occur in individuals
who are at high risk for developing a primary psychotic disorder
regardless of substance exposure.
Psychosis due to another medical condition (see Table 47.8) is
also characterized by prominent hallucinations or delusions, but
history, physical exam, and laboratory findings support a direct
pathophysiologic connection between these symptoms and another
medical condition (see Tables 32.4, 47.4, 47.5, and 47.8). Any sensory modality can be affected by hallucinations. The hallucinations
vary in complexity depending on their etiology, and their description may be highly suggestive of a particular diagnosis, like olfactory hallucinations in temporal lobe epilepsy. Associations between
delusions and medical conditions tend to be less specific. The list
of medical conditions that can cause psychosis is long, and includes
epilepsy, strokes, neoplasms, endocrine disorders, genetic syndromes like velocardiofacial syndrome, autoimmune disorders,
and the permanent sequelae of toxic exposures (see Tables 32.4 and
47.4). Notably, delirium is excluded from psychosis due to another
medical condition. When narrowing the differential between
schizophrenia spectrum disorders, psychosis due to another medical condition, and any other etiology, it is important to consider the
timeline of symptoms, the presence of features that are atypical for
a primary psychosis, and the possibility of substance or medication exposure. Treatment of the underlying medical condition may
or may not require adjunctive antipsychotic treatment for management of psychosis, and the course and prognosis of the psychosis
will likely depend on the etiology.
A notable example of psychosis due to another medical condition is psychosis associated with epilepsy. The disorder manifests
with delusions or hallucinations associated with poor insight, and
can be further differentiated into ictal, interictal, and postictal psychosis. Ictal-­induced psychosis is a form of nonconvulsive status
epilepticus, usually a complex partial status that can last for hours
to days and is associated with periods of impaired consciousness.
Brief interictal psychosis can last days to weeks and is associated
with paranoia, delusions, and auditory hallucinations. Chronic
interictal psychosis resembles schizophrenia and manifests with
paranoia, visual hallucinations, and catatonia. Postictal psychosis is
the most common type (observed in 2–7% of patients with epilepsy)
and lasts up to 1 week and then spontaneously remits. The diagnosis
requires a strong index of suspicion and EEG monitoring. Treatment requires appropriate anticonvulsant drugs and, if the psychosis persists, initiating low-­dose antipsychotic medication.

Disorders
Jennifer A. Zaspel and Rosa K. Kim
Beyond the schizophrenia spectrum of psychotic disorders, substance/
medication-­induced psychotic disorder (Table 47.7) and psychotic disorder due to another medical condition (Table 47.8) can be seen in
pediatric populations.
The hallmark features of substance/medication-­induced psychosis are delusions and hallucinations that develop within the
context of substance exposure: typically a drug of abuse, a medication, or a toxin exposure (see Tables 47.4 and 32.4 for a brief list).
Synthetic cannabinoids (bath salts) are a common drug producing
psychotic effects. A substance-­induced psychosis is distinguished
from a primary psychotic disorder by examining the onset and
course of symptoms; the onset of a primary psychosis may precede
substance exposure and may occur during periods of sustained
abstinence. Once they arise, psychotic symptoms may be present as
long as substance exposure is continued. Although the prevalence
of substance/medication-­induced psychotic disorder in the general

Catatonia is a constellation or syndrome of psychomotor features,
the most notable of which are decreased purposeful motor activity,
decreased engagement in interviews and physical exams, or excessive and peculiar motor activity. The most characteristic symptoms
are waxy flexibility and bizarre poses, but these may or may not
be present (Table 47.9). Diagnosis can be challenging, as psychomotor disturbances can range from unresponsiveness to agitation.
Catatonia has been associated with a broad array of conditions
affecting children, adolescents, and adults, including psychotic,
affective, drug-­related, autoimmune, encephalitic, and neurodevelopmental conditions (Table 47.10). Autoimmune encephalitis may
be the most common etiology in childhood. In addition, catatonia
(autism shut down syndrome) may complicate ASD (Chapter 58).

The exact pathophysiology of catatonia is unknown, but neuroanatomic, neuroendocrine, immunologic, and neurotransmitter-­based
theories have all been proposed based on the various underlying
etiologies of catatonia. Morbidity and mortality are high in adults
who have experienced catatonia and are presumed to be high in
pediatric populations based on limited data primarily because of
the severity of an underlying illness that could cause catatonia.
Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and catatonia tend
to be more impaired than those who do not experience catatonia,
and suicide rates are estimated to be 500-­fold higher than in the
general population.
Catatonia is defined as 3 or more of the 12 symptoms listed in
Table 47.11 and can be described by both etiology and presentation. The DSM-­5 broadly splits etiology into presentations related
to mental disorders and presentations related to another medical
condition, the diagnosis of which must be supported by the patient’s
history, physical exam, and any accompanying laboratory findings.
Pediatric prevalence rates range from 0.6–17% in child psychiatric
inpatients and up to 17% in medically hospitalized children, but
rates are difficult to determine due to underdiagnosis of the condition. Catatonia can be further subdivided into three presentation
categories: stuporous, excited, and malignant. Stuporous presentations are characterized by immobility, mutism, staring, and rigidity, whereas excited presentations include prolonged periods of
psychomotor agitation. Malignant catatonia is an emergent condition, presenting with hyperthermia, hypertension, rhabdomyolysis,
and psychomotor agitation in addition to the psychiatric and motor

Table 47.12  Standard Examination of Catatonia
The method described here is used to complete the 23-­item Bush-­
Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) and the 14-­item Bush-­
Francis Catatonia Screening Instrument (BFCSI). Item definitions
on the two scales are the same. The BFCSI measures only the
presence or absence of the first 14 signs.
Ratings are based solely on observed behaviors during the
examination, with the exception of completing the items for
“withdrawal” and “autonomic abnormality,” which may be based
on directly observed behavior or chart documentation.
As a general rule, only items that are clearly present should be rated.
If the examiner is uncertain as to the presence of an item, rate the
item as “0.”
PROCEDURE
1.	Observe the patient while trying to engage in a conversation.
2.	The examiner should scratch his or her head in an exaggerated
manner.
3.	The arm should be examined for cogwheeling. Attempt to
reposture and instruct the patient to “keep your arm loose.”
Move the arm with alternating lighter and heavier force.
4.	Ask the patient to extend his or her arm. Place one finger beneath
his or her hand and try to raise it slowly after stating, “Do not let
me raise your arm.”
5. Extend the hand stating, “Do not shake my hand.”
6. Reach into your pocket and state, “Stick out your tongue. I want
to stick a pin in it.”
7.	Check for grasp reflex.
8.	Check the chart for reports from the previous 24-­hour period.
Check for oral intake, vital signs, and any incidents.
9.	Observe the patient indirectly, at least for a brief period each day,
regarding the following:
• Activity level
• Abnormal movements
• Abnormal speech
• Echopraxia
• Rigidity
• Negativism
• Waxy flexibility
• Gegenhalten
• Mitgehen
• Ambitendency
• Automatic obedience
• Grasp reflex
Gegenhalten, Resistance to movements that is equal and opposite to the pressure exerted
by examiner; mitgehen, extreme mitmachen where even slightest pressure moves limb;
mitmachen, passive movement of extremity despite instruction not to move.

symptoms seen in catatonia. The differential diagnosis for this type
includes neuroleptic malignant syndrome or serotonin syndrome
(see Chapter 33). Most children will present with a stuporous clinical picture, whereas the remaining cases present as excited or malignant, 19% and 5%, respectively. The severity of symptoms can be
measured and tracked using the Bush-­Francis Catatonia Rating
Scale, a validated tool that accompanies a standardized physical
examination and observation of patient behavior (Table 47.12). The
diagnostic approach is driven by the search for the underlying cause
for catatonia and the monitoring of its potentially dangerous effects
on the body.
Beyond supportive care and discontinuation of any precipitating
agents, treatment of catatonia should be expeditious to reduce the
medical sequelae of prolonged symptoms. Benzodiazepines, in particular lorazepam, are typically first-­line pharmacologic treatment

293

for catatonia. Low-­dose lorazepam is often trialed as a confirmatory
“challenge” for patients with suspected catatonia, where a positive
result is improvement or even resolution of symptoms within hours
of administration of the medication. If the initial challenge test does
reverse symptoms, increasing doses of lorazepam are indicated,
with careful monitoring to avoid side effects (Fig. 47.2). Rapid
withdrawal of benzodiazepines can, in turn, precipitate catatonia in
those who are susceptible. The use of antipsychotics in catatonia is
controversial, as they have been associated with an increased incidence of malignant catatonia or neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
ECT has also been used in both adults and children, though it is
underutilized due to caretaker and ethical concerns. Its use is typically recommended when other viable treatment options have either
not been successful or cannot be safely administered. It has been
successful in treating refractory catatonia in children with autism.

47.4 Hallucinations of Childhood
Jennifer A. Zaspel and Rosa K. Kim
Hallucinations are perceptions that occur in the absence of identifiable external stimuli. Nondiagnostic hallucinations are those that
fall within the realm of normal human experience, such as hearing footsteps, knocking, or one’s name being called. Hypnogogic
and hypnopompic hallucinations are experienced as one transitions into and out of sleep, respectively, and on their own carry
no psychopathologic implications. In younger children, reported
hallucinations can reflect a developmentally appropriate blurring
between fantasy and reality, especially regarding dreams and imaginary friends. Children are also more susceptible to perceptual distortions or illusions (misinterpretations of external stimuli) but
may communicate these phenomena to adults in a way that most
would interpret as hallucinations. The first clinical task in evaluating youth who report hallucinations is to sort out those associated
with severe mental illness from those derived from other causes
(Fig. 47.3).
Acute phobic hallucinations are benign, common, and typically
occur in otherwise healthy preschool children. The hallucinations
are often visual or tactile, last 10-­60 minutes, and most often occur at
night. The children are quite frightened and might complain that bugs
or snakes are crawling over themselves and attempt to remove them.
The child’s fear is not alleviated by reassurance by the parents or physician, and the child is not amenable to reason. Findings on physical
and mental status examinations are otherwise normal, and the cause
is unknown. Symptoms can persist for 1-­3 days, slowly abating over
1-­2 weeks.
In children with nonpsychotic hallucinations, all other symptoms
of psychosis are absent. Nonpsychotic hallucinations typically occur
in the context of severe traumatic stress, developmental difficulties,
social and emotional deprivation, parents whose own psychopathology promotes a breakdown in the child’s sense of reality, cultural beliefs
in mysticism, and unresolved mourning. Auditory hallucinations
of voices telling the child to do “bad things” may be associated with
disruptive behavior disorders in an unconscious attempt to distance
oneself from undesirable behaviors. Hearing a voice invoking suicide
is often associated with depression. Trauma-­related hallucinations are
commonly associated with posttraumatic stress disorder and are likely
a representation of flashbacks. Auditory and visual hallucinations may
similarly be endorsed in complex bereavement. The content of the hallucinations is often relevant in understanding the underlying psychopathology and developmental issues.

Delirium
Colleen K. Manak and Rosa K. Kim
Delirium is defined as a disorder of awareness and attention and is
characterized by its waxing and waning nature. It is not a primary psychiatric diagnosis and instead occurs secondary to an underlying medical condition, though at the time of initial presentation the underlying
cause is often unknown. The symptoms of delirium are similar between
adults and children. Delirium in children carries risks of adverse outcomes, including death, if it is not treated. Untreated delirium can serve
to prolong the recovery course of comorbid and underlying conditions;
the clinical features of delirium, including agitation, aggression, and
confusion, can often interfere with necessary medical care. Delirium
in children and adolescents is associated with a 12.5–29% mortality
rate. Quick recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of delirium and its
underlying cause is essential in ensuring the best outcome for patients.

DIAGNOSIS

Criteria for the diagnosis of delirium are included in the DSM-­5
under Neurocognitive Disorders (Table 48.1). Delirium presents with
an acute onset, developing quickly over the course of hours to days
and symptoms tend to wax and wane. This fluctuation of symptoms
can be dramatic over the course of a day, with a patient appearing

relatively well from a cognitive perspective during one assessment, and
then seeming acutely altered at the next. At the core of delirium is an
alteration in attention and awareness, and a disturbance in cognition.
Patients with delirium will struggle to focus and sustain attention. They
are often disoriented, showing confusion about where they are, poor
orientation to time, and sometimes disorientation to self. In addition
to these core features, delirium often presents with symptoms that have
the potential to be mistaken for psychosis or mania. People with delirium may hallucinate, engage in bizarre or purposeless movements, and
show alterations in their sleep–wake cycles.
Delirium can be further categorized into subtypes (Table 48.2). The
hyperactive subtype is characterized by increased motor activity, loss
of control of activity, restlessness, and wandering. The hypoactive

295

subtype presents with reduction in activity, speed of actions, awareness of surroundings, quantity and speed of speech, and alertness. It is
possible for patients to present with both hyperactive and hypoactive
symptoms over the course of 24 hours, classified as having a mixed
motor subtype. There has been emerging evidence of a fourth group,
identified as the no motor subtype, in which they do not show characteristics of either hyper-­or hypoactive subtypes.
Although these subtypes are often seen in both pediatric and adult
delirium, diagnosing delirium in children can pose challenges not
present in adult populations. Developmental differences, especially
in young children, necessitate alternative approaches to assessing and
diagnosing delirium. Bedside staff and caregivers can provide helpful
insight into behaviors and cognitive changes, such as changes in attention, increased fussiness over baseline, and difficulty soothing, which
might be missed by clinicians who are unable to evaluate symptoms of
delirium using traditional methods (Fig. 48.1).

EPIDEMIOLOGY

The prevalence rate of pediatric delirium is an estimated to be 13–44%
among hospitalized children, with higher rates seen in patients who are
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and/or those being mechanically ventilated. Increased risk for delirium may be associated with the
underlying medical condition, prolonged hospitalization (especially
ICU admission), young age, neurocognitive and developmental disorders, and a personal history of delirium. Potentially modifiable risk factors include polypharmacy, deep sedation, the use of benzodiazepines
and anticholinergic medications, disrupted sleep, pain, sensory deprivation, and lack of familiar environment or caregivers. Delirium can
occur at any age and has been observed in infants in the NICU.

ETIOLOGY

Although nearly any medical condition that requires hospitalization
can lead to delirium, there are diagnoses that are more commonly associated with delirium (Table 48.3). Similarly, there are several drugs that
are associated with the development of delirium in children including benzodiazepines, anticholinergic medications, sedatives, opiates,
steroids, and some illicit substances (synthetic cathinone, synthetic
cannabinoids).

ASSESSMENT

A thorough review of the medical record helps to identify predisposing and precipitating factors including exposures, changes in behavior,
recent illness, and surgeries. If a reasonable cause is unable to be found
on history, a further medical work-­up is usually indicated.
It is possible for children with known psychiatric illnesses to develop
delirium in response to medical stress. Having a comorbid psychiatric
diagnosis should not delay the diagnosis of delirium. Psychiatric illnesses that can be confused with delirium include psychosis, mania,
depression, and catatonia (Table 48.4). Key factors to look for in the
history of patients with delirium are an acute onset without prodrome
or other previous concern for worsening behavioral functioning, variable symptoms from moment to moment, and deficits in attention and
orientation.
One of the factors that complicates assessment of delirium in children is the developmental level of the child. A young child will be
unable to answer some of the standard assessment questions (e.g.,
questions about orientation), which means that a fair amount of the
assessment will come from the bedside staff and the child’s primary
caregivers. More standard assessment strategies can be utilized in older
children and adolescents.
In the patient interview, a good assessment will strive to evaluate
affect, thought process, thought content, attention, and orientation
to make the diagnosis of delirium. Because the nature of delirium
is waxing and waning, it would not be atypical to have a seemingly
normal exam in a patient one suspects to have delirium. Performing
multiple assessments over the course of time is important to making an accurate diagnosis. In delirium, patients can have a disruption in their normal affect and may appear restricted or dysthymic.

Thought processes are often disorganized, tangential, or circumstantial and may seem loosely associated with, or not at all related to,
the reality of what is going on in the moment. Patient with delirium
may also be perseverative in their thought content, with difficulty
moving away from a subject or becoming highly fixated on, or preoccupied with, one thing. They may have altered thought content,
with hallucinations. Visual hallucinations especially are one of the
hallmark alterations of thought content associated with delirium.
Attention is frequently impacted in delirium, with patients demonstrating decreased attention, with an impaired ability to attend to
a conversation or a situation. Orientation in people with delirium
is often altered, especially with regards to orientation to place and
time. Although all of these changes are observed to wax and wane
during the course of delirium, changes in orientation can be the
most striking, with patients sometimes going from being fully oriented to quite confused in the span of hours.

RATING SCALES

There are multiple rating scales that have been created to help to screen
for delirium, particularly in critical care or intensive care setting (see
Fig. 48.1). The Cornell Assessment for Pediatric Delirium (CAPD),
Pediatric Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit
(pCAM-­ICU), Preschool Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU
(psCAM-­ICU), and Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) are all
scales that are frequently used to help monitor for delirium. The CAPD,
pCAM-­ICU, and psCAM-­ICU have all been validated for use in the
pediatric population. Rating scales are not diagnostic on their own but
can be useful for identifying patients at risk for delirium and for following response to treatment.

298 Part III u Behavioral and Psychiatric Disorders
the evaluation for delirium, rather clinicians should be guided by the
history and medical concerns. There are times when laboratory, imaging, and other testing modalities can be helpful particularly in patients
with suspected delirium when the underlying medical etiology of delirium is unknown.
Central nervous system imaging may be recommended to help
identify underlying processes that may be contributing to delirium;
brain imaging on its own is not a tool that can diagnose delirium
and is not recommended for the sole purpose of diagnosis.
Electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the few tools that can
be used to help confirm a delirium diagnosis if there is diagnostic ambiguity or uncertainty. Various studies have found 65–86%
of children with delirium have abnormal EEGs. Findings associated
with delirium typically include some degree of diffuse background
slowing and disorganization. This EEG finding has been shown to
effectively discriminate between children with delirium and healthy
controls. However, these EEG findings are nonspecific and are not
sufficient to diagnose delirium. Another caveat when utilizing
EEG in the evaluation of delirium is the reality that several of the
underlying causes of delirium, including metabolic derangement,
seizures, infections, and intoxication, can also lead to EEG changes
in the absence of delirium (see Table 48.3).

underlying process is being treated and removing medications that
may precipitate or worsen delirium.

Both medical and psychiatric disorders may share or mimic some of the
symptoms of delirium and can sometimes lead to complications when
trying to make the diagnosis. Catatonia, depression, and psychosis are
some of the more frequently occurring diagnoses that can be confused for
delirium in children and especially adolescents (see Table 48.4; see Chapter
47). In particular, catatonia can be difficult to separate from delirium, especially because the two can co-­occur. It is important to attempt to clarify
the diagnosis because treatment of delirium and catatonia is different; the
treatment for one can exacerbate the other. To help distinguish between
the two, it is often helpful to assess for motor signs seen in catatonia that are
not typically present in delirium (see Chapter 47.3). Additionally, catatonia
is less likely to present with a waxing and waning course. The Bush-­Francis
Rating Scale can be used to help diagnose catatonia (see Table 47.12).
Delirium can also mimic psychosis, frequently presenting with hallucinations and sometimes delusions. One of the most profound differences
between the two is the onset; delirium has an acute onset compared with
the prodromal nature of a first episode of psychosis. It would be unusual
for primary psychosis to develop over the course of days. However, this
is characteristic of delirium. Hallucinations in delirium are often visual,
whereas primary psychotic illnesses typically present with predominantly
auditory hallucinations. Delusional thought content in delirium often lacks
any internal structure or interconnectedness, while delusions in primary
psychotic disorders are frequently structured around a common theme.
Patients with depression may have some characteristics of delirium.
The course and onset can help to distinguish depression from delirium;
with depression the timing of onset is often closer to that of delirium.
Depression does not demonstrate a waxing and waning course, and
while cognition can be affected, it is often slowed with some memory
problems, whereas orientation remains intact.

Antipsychotics

TREATMENT
Nonpharmacologic Interventions

Other Medications

Nonpharmacologic interventions are a mainstay in both delirium
treatment and prevention. The goal behind these interventions is to
provide a supportive environment and to provide sensory and environmental modifications to help offset the challenges posed by the
need for hospital-­based care and treatment. Strategies such as frequent
reorientation, adherence to normal routines, clustering care, and maintaining a normal sleep–wake cycle are all frequently implemented to
prevent or manage delirium (Table 48.5)

Pharmacologic Treatment

Pharmacologic management of delirium focuses on both utilizing medications to help manage the symptoms of delirium while the

Medications for the behavioral symptoms of delirium target disruptive
behaviors that pose a danger to the patient and caregivers and interfere
with necessary medical care. Although these medications do not treat
the underlying cause of delirium, they can help to decrease distress
and lead to a shorter overall course. Antipsychotic medications are the
mainstay of treatment for the behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of
delirium. Both first-­and second-­generation antipsychotics are effective,
and the choice of medication is based on what other medical needs are
co-­occurring. It is recommended to “start low and go slow” to arrive at
an effective dose. Although typically used only for a short course (days
to weeks), it remains important to consider adverse effects of antipsychotic medications (see Chapter 33). All antipsychotics can cause QTc
prolongation; thus it is recommended that electrocardiogram (ECG)
monitoring be considered at the onset of and throughout the treatment.
For a patient who is unable to take medications by mouth, intramuscular
(IM) or intravenous (IV) haloperidol can be used. IV haloperidol is more
potent than IM or oral haloperidol; switching between formulations and
modes of administration must be done carefully. For patients who can
take medications by mouth, second-­generation antipsychotics are typically the preferred choice. Risperidone, quetiapine, and olanzapine have
all been shown to be effective in treating children and adolescents with
delirium. Risperidone and olanzapine are available in an oral disintegrating tablet, and quetiapine is available in a liquid solution, which makes
them easy to administer for patients who are dependent on a nasogastric
tube for nutrition. Choice of medication is often dependent on what is
available in the treatment setting, and the preferred route of administration. In chronically ill medical patients, inquiring about a past history of
delirium and treatment can be helpful in guiding medication choices.
Melatonin has some utility in the management of delirium as it can
help to promote a normal circadian rhythm and the return to a healthy
sleep–wake cycle. Trazodone has also been shown to have some benefit
for patients who are struggling with nocturnal sleep maintenance.

Medications to Avoid

In addition to adding medications for the treatment of delirium, eliminating unnecessary or potentially deliriogenic medications is equally
important. Benzodiazepines worsen delirium and should be avoided as
much as possible in patients at risk of developing delirium. They should
not be used to treat agitation in delirious patients. Anticholinergic
medications are also known to potentiate delirium and should also be
avoided. Minimizing polypharmacy to the extent possible can help to

Chapter 48 u Delirium
eliminate potentially deliriogenic medications and aid in the prevention of delirium.

Pain Medications

Opiate pain medications can be associated with worsening delirium
and should be used with care in patients at risk for delirium. Complicating this is the reality that untreated or undertreated pain can also
be associated with the development and perpetuation of delirium, so
ensuring adequate pain control will help to manage, and in some cases,
prevent delirium.

Course and Sequelae
Course

The resolution of delirium can be variable. Some patients improve
quickly once the underlying cause is identified and treated, while

299

others may take weeks to months to show full resolution of symptoms.
Patients who have delirium related to complex medical issues, such as
autoimmune encephalitis, or prolonged hospital stays, may have longer
lasting delirium. When symptoms improve, antipsychotic medications
can be weaned; patients do not need to be on them long term.

Sequelae

Patients who have delirium are more likely to have subsequent episodes
of delirium. There is evidence that patients with delirium go on to have
impaired cognitive functioning compared to patients who have never
had an episode of delirium.

Disorders

PART

ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS

Chapter 49

Neurodevelopmental and
Executive Function and
Dysfunction
Desmond P. Kelly and Darla H. McCain
TERMINOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY

A neurodevelopmental function is a basic brain process needed for
learning and productivity and involves the following core neurodevelopmental domains: sensory, motor, language, visual-­spatial/visual-­
perceptual, intellectual, memory, social cognition, and executive
function. Executive function (EF) is a broad term used to describe
specific neurocognitive processes involved in the regulating, guiding, organizing, and monitoring of thoughts and actions to achieve a
specific goal. Processes considered to be “executive” in nature include
inhibition/impulse control, cognitive/mental flexibility, emotional
control, initiation skills, planning, organization, working memory, and
self-­monitoring.
Neurodevelopmental variation refers to differences in neurodevelopmental functioning. Wide variations in these functions exist within
and between individuals. These differences can change over time and
need not represent pathology or abnormality.
Neurodevelopmental and/or executive dysfunctions reflect any
disruptions or weaknesses in these processes, which may result from
neuroanatomic disturbance or neuropsychologic malfunctioning.
Neurodevelopmental and/or executive dysfunction places a child at
risk for developmental, cognitive, emotional, behavioral, psychosocial,
and adaptive challenges. Preschool-­age children with neurodevelopmental or executive dysfunction may manifest delays in developmental domains such as language, motor, self-­help, or social-­emotional
development and self-­regulation. For the school-­age child, an area of
particular focus is academic skill development. It is at this age that disorders of learning are often diagnosed. The Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorder, Fifth Edition (DSM-­5) classifies disorders
of learning within the group of neurodevelopmental disorders as specific learning disorder (SLD), with separate specifiers recognizing
impairments in reading, written expression, and mathematics. In the
International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition (ICD-­10), neurodevelopmental disorders include specific developmental disorders
of scholastic skills with specific reading disorder, mathematics disorder, and disorder of written expression. Dyslexia is a term used more
frequently by neurologists and by some advocacy groups to describe
reading disorders. Disorders of EF have traditionally been viewed as
a component of attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
which is also classified in DSM-­5 as a neurodevelopmental disorder.
Frontal lobe and executive function deficit is a recognized diagnostic
term used primarily by neuropsychologists.
There are no prevalence estimates specifically for neurodevelopmental dysfunction, but overall estimates for learning disorders range from
5% to 10% or more with a similar range reported for ADHD. These
disorders frequently co-­occur. The range in prevalence is related to
differences in criteria used for classification and diagnosis, the overlap and interaction of neurodevelopmental variations, and differing
methods of assessment.

IV

Neurodevelopmental and executive dysfunction may result from a
broad range of etiologic factors, including genetic, medical, psychologic, environmental, and sociocultural influences.
A high degree of heritability is reported in learning and attention disorders, with estimates ranging from 45% to 80%, but identification of
specific gene associations is elusive. Neurodevelopmental dysfunctions
generally fall along a continuum of traits with disorders becoming evident at extremes of dimensions or thresholds of dysfunction. The same
genetic and early environmental risk factors that are associated with a
disorder such as ADHD also predict trait levels in the general population. Specific genes have been identified as associated with reading disorders, including the DYX2 locus on chromosome 6p22 and the DYX3
locus on 2p12. Neuroimaging studies have confirmed links between gene
variations and variations in cortical thickness in areas of the brain known
to be associated with learning and academic performance, such as the
temporal regions. Chromosomal abnormalities can lead to unique patterns of dysfunction, such as visual-­spatial deficits in females diagnosed
with Turner syndrome (see Chapter 99.4) or executive and language
deficits in children with fragile X syndrome (see Chapter 99.6). Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (see Chapter 99.3) has been associated
with predictable patterns of neurodevelopmental and executive dysfunction that can be progressive, including a higher prevalence of intellectual
disability and deficits in visual-­spatial processing, attention, working
memory (e.g., the ability to hold and manipulate information over short
periods), verbal learning, arithmetic, and language.
Perinatal factors, including very low birthweight, severe intrauterine growth restriction, perinatal hypoxic-­ischemic encephalopathy, and
prenatal exposure to substances such as alcohol and drugs or infections,
may independently disrupt neurodevelopment or exacerbate genetic
vulnerabilities. Increased risk of neurodevelopmental and executive dysfunction has also been associated with environmental toxins, including
lead (see Chapter 761); drugs such as cocaine; infections such as meningitis, HIV, and Zika; and brain injury associated with intraventricular
hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, or head trauma. The negative
academic impact of concussion in children and adolescents, although
usually temporary, has been well characterized, including impaired concentration and slowed processing speed. Repeated injuries have a much
higher likelihood of long-­term negative neurocognitive effects.
Early psychologic trauma may result in both structural and neurochemical changes in the developing brain, which may contribute to
neurodevelopmental and executive dysfunction. Exposure to trauma,
abuse, or other adverse experiences in early childhood in the absence
of positive experiences—primarily safe, stable, and nurturing relationships—can lead to diminished regulatory influences mediated by key
brain regions (hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) and may influence right hemisphere function with associated risk for problems with
information processing, memory, focus, and self-­regulation. Environmental and sociocultural deprivation can also lead to, or potentiate,
neurodevelopmental and executive dysfunction, and numerous studies
have indicated that parent/caregiver executive functioning affects the
development of EFs in children.
Investigations of neuroanatomic substrates have yielded important
information about the underlying pathogenesis in neurodevelopmental and executive dysfunction. Differences have been demonstrated in
the left parietotemporal and left occipitotemporal brain regions of individuals with dyslexia compared to those without reading difficulties (see
Chapter 51). Studies have also described the neural circuitry, primarily in the parietal cortex, underlying mathematical competencies such
as the processing of numerical magnitude and mental arithmetic. The
associations between executive dysfunction and the prefrontal/frontal
cortex have been established, and injury to the frontal lobe regions often

Chapter 49 u Neurodevelopmental and Executive Function and Dysfunction
result in dysfunction of executive abilities (e.g., poor inhibitory control). Although the prefrontal/frontal cortex may be the primary control
region for EFs, there is considerable interconnectivity between the brain’s
frontal regions and other areas, such as arousal systems (reticular activating system), motivational and emotional systems (limbic system), cortical association systems (posterior/anterior; left/right hemispheres), and
input/output systems (frontal motor/posterior sensory areas).

CORE NEURODEVELOPMENTAL FUNCTIONS

The neurodevelopmental processes that are critical to a child’s successful functioning may best be understood as falling within core neurodevelopmental domains that are highly integrated.

Sensory and Motor Function

Sensory development begins well before birth in the primary visual,
auditory, and somatosensory cortical regions along with the olfactory and gustatory cortices. This neurodevelopmental process is crucial in helping children experience, understand, and manipulate their
environments. Sensory development progresses in association with
environmental exposure and with the development of other cognitive
processes, such as motor development. Through sensory experiences,
children’s brains mature as new neuronal pathways are created and
existing pathways are strengthened.
There are three distinct, yet related, forms of neuromotor ability:
fine motor, graphomotor, and gross motor coordination. Fine motor
function reflects the ability to control the muscles that produce small,
exact movements. Deficits in fine motor function can disrupt the ability to communicate in written form and to excel in artistic and crafts
activities and can interfere with learning a musical instrument or
mastering a computer keyboard.
Graphomotor function refers to the specific motor aspects of written
output. Several subtypes of graphomotor dysfunction can significantly
impede writing. Children who harbor weaknesses of visualization during writing have trouble picturing the configurations of letters and
words as they write (orthographics), with poorly legible written output
and inconsistent spacing between words. Others have weaknesses in
orthographic memory and may labor over individual letters and prefer
printing (manuscript) to cursive writing. Some exhibit signs of finger
agnosia and have trouble localizing their fingers while they write, needing to keep their eyes very close to the page and applying excessive
pressure to the pencil. Others struggle to produce the highly coordinated motor sequences needed for writing. It is important to emphasize that a child may show excellent fine motor dexterity (as revealed
in mechanical or artistic domains) but very poor graphomotor fluency
(with labored or poorly legible writing).
Gross motor function refers to control of large muscles. Children
with gross motor incoordination often have problems in processing
“outer spatial” information to guide gross motor actions. Affected children may be inept at catching or throwing a ball because they cannot
form accurate judgments about trajectories in space. Others demonstrate
diminished body position sense. They do not efficiently receive or interpret proprioceptive and kinesthetic feedback from peripheral joints and
muscles. They are likely to evidence difficulties when activities demand
balance and tracking of body position and movement. Others are unable
to meet the motor planning demands of complex motor procedures such
as those needed for dancing, gymnastics, or swimming.
The term dyspraxia relates to difficulty in developing an ideomotor
plan and activating coordinated and integrated visual-­motor actions to
complete a task or solve a motor problem, such as assembling a model
or learning a new movement.
Developmental coordination disorder is categorized in DSM-­5 as a
motor disorder where the learning and execution of coordinated motor
skills is below age level given the child’s opportunity for skill learning,
and the motor difficulties significantly interfere with activities of daily
living, academic productivity, and play.

Language

Language is one of the most critical and complex cognitive functions
and can be broadly divided into receptive (auditory comprehension/

301

understanding) and expressive (speech and language production and/
or communication) functions (see Chapter 53). Children who primarily experience receptive language problems may have difficulty understanding verbal information, following instructions and explanations,
and interpreting what they hear. Expressive language weaknesses can
result from problems with speech production and/or problems with
higher-­level language development. Speech production difficulties
include oromotor problems affecting articulation, verbal fluency, and
naming. Some children have trouble with sound sequencing within
words. Others find it difficult to regulate the rhythm or prosody of their
verbal output. Their speech may be dysfluent, hesitant, and inappropriate in tone. Problems with word retrieval can result in difficulty finding exact words when needed (as in a class discussion) or substituting
definitions for words (circumlocution).
The basic components of language include phonology (ability to
process and integrate the individual sounds in words), semantics
(understanding the meaning of words), syntax (mastery of word order
and grammatical rules), discourse (processing and producing paragraphs and passages), metalinguistics (ability to think about and analyze how language works and draw inferences), and pragmatics (social
understanding and application of language). Children who evidence
higher-­level expressive language impediments have trouble formulating sentences, using grammar appropriately, and organizing spoken
(and possibly written) narratives.
To one degree or another, all academic skills are taught largely
through language, and thus it is not surprising that children who experience language dysfunction often experience problems with academic
performance. In fact, some studies suggest that up to 80% of children
who present with a specific learning disorder also experience language-­
based weaknesses. Additionally, the role of language in executive
functioning cannot be understated, because language serves to guide
cognition and behavior.

Visual-­Spatial/Visual-­Perceptual Function

Important structures involved in the development and function of
the visual system include the retina, the optic nerves, the brainstem
(control of automatic responses, e.g., pupil dilation), the thalamus
(e.g., lateral geniculate nucleus for form, motion, color), and the
primary (visual space and orientation) and secondary (color perception) visual processing regions located in and around the occipital
lobe. Other brain areas, although considered to be outside of the primary visual system, are also important to visual function, helping to
process what is seen (temporal lobe) and where it is located in space
(parietal lobe).
Critical aspects of visual processing development in the child
include appreciation of spatial relations (ability to perceive objects
accurately in space in relation to other objects), visual discrimination
(ability to differentiate and identify objects based on their individual
attributes, e.g., size, shape, color, form, position), and visual closure
(ability to recognize or identify an object when the entire object cannot
be seen). Visual-­spatial processing dysfunctions are rarely the cause of
reading disorders, but some investigations have established that deficits in orthographic coding (visual-­spatial analysis of character-­based
systems) can contribute to reading disorders. Spelling and writing can
emerge as a weakness because children with visual processing problems
usually have trouble with the precise visual configurations of words.
In mathematics, these children often have difficulty with visual-­spatial
orientation, with resultant difficulty aligning digits in columns when
performing calculations and difficulty managing geometric material.
In the social realm, intact visual processing allows a child to make use
of visual or physical cues when communicating and interpreting the
paralinguistic aspects of language. Secure visual functions are also
necessary to process proprioceptive and kinesthetic feedback and to
coordinate movements during physical activities.

Intellectual Function

A useful definition of intellectual function is the capacity to think
in the abstract, reason, problem-­solve, and comprehend. Intelligence
is viewed as a global construct composed of more specific cognitive

302 Part IV u Learning and Developmental Disorders
functions (e.g., auditory and visual-­perceptual processing, spatial abilities, processing speed, and working memory).
The expression of intellect is mediated by many factors, including language development, sensorimotor abilities, genetics, heredity,
environment, and neurodevelopmental function. When an individual’s measured intelligence is >2 standard deviations below the mean
(a standard score of <70 on most IQ tests) and accompanied by significant weaknesses in adaptive skills, the diagnosis of intellectual
disability may be warranted (see Chapter 56). Functionally, some
common characteristics distinguish children with intellectual disability from those with average or above-­average abilities. Typically, those
at the lowest end of the spectrum (e.g., profound or severe intellectual disability) are incapable of independent function and require a
highly structured environment with constant aid and supervision. At
the other end of the spectrum are those with unusually well-­developed
intellect (“gifted”). Stronger intellect has been associated with better-­
developed concept formation, critical thinking, problem solving,
understanding and formulation of rules, brainstorming and creativity,
and metacognition (ability to “think about thinking”). Although high
levels of intellectual functioning offer many opportunities, they can
also be associated with functional challenges related to socialization,
learning, and communication style.
Individuals whose intellect falls in the below-­average range (sometimes referred to as the “borderline” or “slow learner” range) tend to
experience greater difficulty processing and managing information
that is abstract, making connections between concepts and ideas, and
generalizing information (e.g., may be able to comprehend a concept in
one setting but be unable to carry it over and apply it in different situations). In general, these individuals tend to do better when information is presented in more concrete and explicit terms (with repetition)
and when working with rote information (e.g., memorizing specific
material).

Memory

Memory is a term used to describe the complex, cognitive mechanism
by which information is acquired, retained, and recalled. Major brain
areas involved in memory processing include the hippocampus, fornix,
temporal lobes, and cerebellum, with connections in and between most
brain regions. Memory consists of multiple distinct and interconnected
subsystems that are categorized based on the length of time information is stored (e.g., short-­term memory, long-­term memory), type of
information stored (e.g., events, facts, procedures, emotional associations, conditioned reflexes), modality of the information (e.g., visual,
auditory, olfactory), and whether memories are consciously recalled
(explicit memory) or unconsciously recalled (implicit memory).
Information processing models also include working memory as a
distinct component.
Memory formation begins with sensory input (e.g., auditory, visual,
tactile) that is identified, or registered, and subsequently encoded.
Encoding is a mental process that transforms perceptual input into a
representational code for the memory system. Information in short-­
term memory is transferred into long-­term memory through the process of consolidation and storage. Information capacity in short-­term
memory is limited and brief, lasting for seconds to minutes, whereas
information in long-­term memory is potentially unlimited in terms of
capacity and can be available for hours or as long as a life span.
Once information finds its way into long-­term memory, it must be
accessed. In general, information can be retrieved spontaneously (a
process known as free recall) or with the aid of cues (cued or recognition recall). With deliberate, repeated practice, children can develop
automaticity, the ability to instantaneously and effortlessly access
information that has been learned in the past. Automaticity frees cognitive resources to process other information and promote learning.
For example, automaticity in decoding words allows a child to focus on
the meaning of the text.

Social Cognition

The development of effective social skills is heavily dependent on
secure social cognition, which consists of mental processes that allow

an individual to understand and interact with the social environment.
Although some evidence shows that social cognition exists as a discrete
area of neurodevelopmental function, multiple cognitive processes are
involved with social cognition. These include the ability to recognize,
interpret, and make sense of the thoughts, communications (verbal and
nonverbal), and actions of others; the ability to understand that others’ perceptions, perspectives, and intentions might differ from one’s
own (commonly referred to as “theory of mind”); the ability to use language to communicate with others socially (pragmatic language); and
the ability to make inferences about others and the environment based
on contextual information. It can also be argued that social cognition
involves processes associated with memory and EFs, such as flexibility
and shifting. Children with autism spectrum disorder harbor deficits in
social cognition (see Chapter 58).

Executive Function

EF involves multiple skills (Table 49.1) that begin development early in
life (early indications of inhibitory control and even working memory
have been found in infancy), mature significantly during the preschool
years, and continue to develop through adolescence and well into adulthood. Some studies suggest that secure EF may be more important
than intellectual ability for academic success and have revealed that
a child’s ability to delay gratification early in life predicts competency,
attention, self-­regulation, frustration tolerance, aptitude, physical and
mental health, and even risk for substance dependency in adolescence
and adulthood. Conversely, deficits in other areas of neurodevelopment,
such as language development, affect EF.
Attention is far from a unitary, independent, or specific brain function. This may be best illustrated through the phenotype associated
with ADHD (see Chapter 50). Disordered attention can result from
faulty mechanisms in and across subdomains of attention. These subdomains include selective attention (ability to focus attention on a
particular stimulus and to discriminate relevant from irrelevant information), divided attention (ability to orient to more than one stimulus
at a given time), sustained attention (ability to maintain one’s focus),
and alternating attention (capacity to shift focus between stimuli).
Attention problems in children can manifest at any point, from
arousal through output. Children with diminished alertness and

Chapter 49 u Neurodevelopmental and Executive Function and Dysfunction
arousal can exhibit signs of mental fatigue in a classroom or when
engaged in any activity requiring sustained focus. They are apt to have
difficulty directing and sustaining their concentration, and their efforts
may be erratic and unpredictable, with extreme performance inconsistency. Weaknesses in determining saliency often result in allocating cognitive resources to the wrong stimuli, at home, in school, and
socially, and missing important information. Distractibility can take
the form of listening to extraneous noises instead of a teacher, staring
out the window, or constantly thinking about the future. Attention dysfunction can affect the output of work, behavior, and social activity. It
is important to appreciate that most children with attentional dysfunction also have other forms of neurodevelopmental dysfunction that can
be associated with academic disorders (with some estimates suggesting
up to 60% comorbidity).
Inhibitory control (IC) can be described as one’s ability to restrain,
resist, and not act (cognitively or behaviorally/emotionally) on a
thought. IC may also be seen as one’s ability to stop thoughts or ongoing actions. Deficits in this behavioral/impulse regulation mechanism
are a core feature of the combined or hyperactive impulsive presentation of ADHD and have a significant adverse impact on a child’s overall
functioning. In everyday settings, children with weak IC may exhibit
difficulties with self-­
control and self-­
monitoring of their behavior
and output (e.g., impulsivity), may not recognize their own errors or
mistakes, and often act prematurely and without consideration of the
potential consequences of their actions. In the social context, disinhibited children may interrupt others and demonstrate other impulsive behaviors that often interfere with interpersonal relationships. The
indirect consequences of poor IC can include challenges with behavior, emotional regulation, and academic functioning and have adverse
impacts on social interactions and safety.
Shifting is the ability to transition from one activity, topic, or aspect
of a problem to another when needed. Effective shifting allows a child
to flexibly move through their day, tolerating changes in schedule and
routine. Additionally, shifting allows a child to change strategies when
working a problem and adjust to changes in topics when conversing with
others. Children with difficulties in shifting can become quickly upset
in novel situations (e.g., when presented with a substitute teacher) and
show marked resistance to change in routine. They can get stuck on one
problem-­
solving strategy, which compromises their work efficiency.
Socially, problems with shifting can result in one-­sided conversations,
negatively affecting a child’s ability to build and maintain friendships.
Initiation refers to the ability to independently begin an activity,
a task, or thought process (e.g., problem-­solve). Children who present with initiation difficulties often have trouble “getting started.” This
can be exhibited behaviorally, such that the child struggles to start on
physical activities like getting out of bed or beginning chores. Cognitively, weaknesses in initiation may manifest as difficulty coming up
with ideas or generating plans. In school, children who have poor initiation abilities may be slow or unable to start homework assignments
or tests. In social situations, initiation challenges may cause a child to
have difficulty beginning conversations, calling on friends, or going out
with friends.
Deficits in “primary” initiation are relatively rare and are often associated with significant neurologic conditions and treatments (e.g., traumatic brain injury, anoxia, effects of radiation treatment in childhood
cancer). More often, initiation deficits are secondary to other executive problems (e.g., disorganization) or behavioral (e.g., oppositional/
defiant behaviors), developmental (e.g., autism spectrum disorder), or
emotional (e.g., depression, anxiety) disorders.
Working memory (WM) can be defined as the ability to hold,
manipulate, and store information for short periods. In its simplest
form, WM involves the interaction of short-­term verbal and visual
processes (e.g., memory, phonologic awareness, and spatial skills) with
a centralized control mechanism that is responsible for coordinating all
the cognitive processes involved (e.g., temporarily suspending information in memory while manipulating it). Ultimately, this function
enables new information arriving in short-­term memory to be linked
to prior knowledge or procedures held in long-­term memory. As such,
working memory is critical to be able to complete multistep problems

303

and more complex instructions and tasks. WM capacity can double or
triple between the preschool years and adolescence. In the classroom, a
child with a weakness in working memory might appear inattentive or
careless when completing their work. When doing math, a child with
WM dysfunction might have difficulty carrying a number and following the expected procedure. When reading a paragraph, a child might
not recall key facts or be able to integrate information when reading,
particularly long paragraphs. For writing tasks, a child might leave out
ideas they intended to express while they are recalling grammar rules,
such as placing a comma, and working on spelling a word correctly.
Planning refers to the ability to effectively generate, sequence, and
put into motion the steps and procedures necessary to realize a specific
goal. In real-­world settings, children who struggle with planning are
typically described by caregivers and teachers as being inept at independently gathering what is required to solve a problem or as unable to
complete more weighty assignments. These children commonly exhibit
poor time management skills.
Organization is an ability that represents a child’s proficiency in
arranging, ordering, classifying, and categorizing information. Planning and organizing depend on discrimination ability, which refers to
the child’s ability to determine what is and is not valuable when trying
to problem-­solve or organize. Common daily life challenges associated
with organizational difficulties in childhood include problems with
gathering and managing materials or items. When children struggle
with organization, indirect consequences may include becoming overwhelmed with information and being unable to complete a task or
activity. Effective organization is a vital component in learning (more
specifically, in memory/retention); many studies, along with clinical
experience, have shown that poor organization significantly affects
how well a child recalls information.
Self-­monitoring involves awareness and assessment of one’s actions,
whether it be a work product (e.g., writing an essay) or social interaction with another. This EF allows one to evaluate and make necessary
corrections. Children with difficulty in self-­monitoring fail to recognize
errors in their work and struggle with editing. When interacting with
others, they may not realize how their verbal and nonverbal behaviors
are being perceived, ultimately missing opportunities to correct their
behavior and resulting in poor social interactions.
Emotional control is the ability to regulate emotions in order to
realize goals and direct one’s behavior, thoughts, and actions. It has
been well established that affective/emotional states have an impact on
many aspects of functioning. Conversely, executive function or dysfunction often contributes to modulation of affect. Although emotional
control is highly interrelated with different EFs (e.g., disinhibition, self-­
monitoring), separating it conceptually facilitates an appreciation for
and recognition of the often-­overlooked role that a child’s emotional
state plays in cognitive and behavioral functioning. Children with weak
emotional control may exhibit explosive outbursts, poor temper/anger
control, and oversensitivity. Understanding a child’s emotional state is
vital to understanding its impact not only on executive functioning but
also on functioning as a whole (e.g., socially, mentally, behaviorally,
academically).
Any discussion involving emotional control should also recognize
motivation. Motivation/effort may be defined as the reason or reasons
one acts or behaves in a certain way. Less motivated children are less
likely to engage and utilize all their abilities. Such a disposition not
only interferes with application of executive skills but also results in
less-­than-­optimal performance and functioning. The less success a
child feels, the less likely the child is to put forth effort and to persevere
when things become more challenging. If a child’s initial efforts are met
with a negative reaction, the likelihood that the child will continue putting forth adequate effort diminishes. If left unchecked, a child’s overall level of functioning will likely be compromised. More importantly,
the child’s sense of personal efficacy (e.g., self-­esteem) and competence
may suffer.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

and executive dysfunction differ with age. Preschool-­age children

304 Part IV u Learning and Developmental Disorders
might present with delayed language development, including problems with articulation, vocabulary development, word finding, and
rhyming. They often experience early challenges with learning colors,
shapes, letters, numbers, the alphabet, and days of the week. Children
with visual processing deficits may have difficulty learning to draw
and write and have problems with art activities. These children might
also have trouble discriminating between left and right. They might
encounter problems recognizing letters and words. Difficulty following
instructions, overactivity, and distractibility may be early symptoms
of emerging executive dysfunction. Difficulties with fine motor development (e.g., grasping crayons/pencils, coloring, drawing) and social
interaction may develop. These manifestations should be considered
as potential “red flags” for future learning challenges (see “Assessment
and Diagnosis”).
School-­age children with neurodevelopmental and executive dysfunctions can vary widely in clinical presentations. Their specific patterns of academic performance and behavior represent final common
pathways of neurodevelopmental strengths and deficits interacting
with environmental, social, or cultural factors; temperament; educational experience; and intrinsic resilience (Table 49.2). Children with
language weaknesses might have problems integrating and associating
letters and sounds, decoding words, deriving meaning, and being able
to comprehend passages. Children with early signs of a mathematics
weakness might have difficulty with concepts of quantity or with adding or subtracting without using concrete representation (e.g., their
fingers when calculating). Difficulty learning time concepts and confusion with directions (right/left) might also be observed. Poor fine
motor control and coordination and poor planning can lead to writing
problems. Attention and behavioral regulation weaknesses observed
earlier can continue, and together with other EF weaknesses (e.g.,
organization, initiation skills), further complicate the child’s ability
to acquire and generalize new knowledge. Children with weaknesses
in WM may struggle to remember the steps necessary to complete an
activity or problem-­solve. In social settings, these children often have
difficulty keeping up with more complex conversations.

*Isolated neurodevelopmental dysfunction can lead to a specific academic disorder, but
more often there is a combination of factors underlying weak academic performance.
In addition to the dysfunction in neurodevelopmental domains as listed in the table,
the clinician must also consider the possibility of limitations of intellectual and
cognitive abilities or associated social and emotional problems.

In middle school children the substantial increase in cognitive, academic, and regulatory demands can cause further difficulties for those
with existing neurodevelopmental and executive challenges. In reading
and writing, middle school children might present with transposition
and sequencing errors; might struggle with root words, prefixes, and
suffixes; might have difficulty with written expression; and might avoid
reading and writing altogether. Challenges completing word problems
in math are common. Difficulty with recall of information might also
be experienced. Although observable in both lower and more advanced
grades, behavioral, emotional, and social difficulties tend to become
more salient in middle school children who experience cognitive or
academic problems.
High school students can present with deficient reading comprehension, written expression, and slower processing efficiency. Difficulty
in answering open-­ended questions, dealing with abstract information,
and deploying executive control (e.g., self-­monitoring, organization,
planning, self-­starting) is often reported.

Academic Problems

Reading disorders (see Chapter 51) can stem from a number of neurodevelopmental dysfunctions, as described earlier (see Table 49.2).
Most often, language and auditory processing weaknesses are present,
as evidenced by poor phonologic processing that results in deficiencies
at the level of decoding individual words and, consequently, a delay in
automaticity (e.g., acquiring a repertoire of words readers can identify instantly) that causes reading to be slow, laborious, and frustrating. Deficits in other core neurodevelopmental domains might also be
present. Weak WM might make it difficult for a child to hold sounds
and symbols in mind while breaking down words into their component sounds, or might cause reading comprehension problems. Some
children experience temporal-­ordering weaknesses and struggle with
reblending phonemes into correct sequences. Memory dysfunction
can cause problems with recall and summarization of what was read.
Some children with higher-­order cognitive deficiencies have trouble
understanding what they read because they lack a strong grasp of the
concepts in a text. Although rare as a cause of reading difficulty, problems with visual-­spatial functions (e.g., visual perception) can cause
children difficulty in recognizing letters. It is not unusual for children
with reading problems to avoid reading practice, and a delay in reading proficiency becomes increasingly pronounced and difficult to
remediate.
Spelling and writing impairments share many related underlying
processing deficits with reading, so it is not surprising that the two
disorders often occur simultaneously in school-­age children (see Table
49.2). Core neurodevelopmental weaknesses that underlie spelling difficulties include phonologic and decoding difficulties, orthographic
problems (coding letters and words into memory), and morphologic
deficits (use of suffixes, prefixes, and root words). Problems in these
areas can manifest as phonetically poor, yet visually comparable,
approximations to the actual word (faght for fight), spelling that is phonetically correct but visually incorrect (fite for fight), and inadequate
spelling patterns (plade for played). Children with memory disorders
might misspell words because of coding weaknesses. Others misspell
because of poor auditory WM that interferes with their ability to process letters. Sequencing weaknesses often result in transposition errors
when spelling.
Writing difficulties have been classified as disorder of written
expression, or dysgraphia (see Table 49.2). Although many of the
same dysfunctions described for reading and spelling can contribute
to problems with writing, written expression is the most complex of
the language arts, requiring synthesis of many neurodevelopmental
functions (e.g., auditory, visual-­spatial, memory, executive; see Chapter 52.2). Weaknesses in these functions can result in written output
that is difficult to comprehend, disjointed, and poorly organized. The
child with WM challenges can lose track of what the child intended to
write. Attention deficits can make it difficult for a child to mobilize and
sustain the mental effort, pacing, and self-­monitoring demands necessary for writing. In many cases, writing is laborious because of an
underlying graphomotor dysfunction (e.g., fluency does not keep pace

Chapter 49 u Neurodevelopmental and Executive Function and Dysfunction
with ideation and language production). Thoughts may also be forgotten or underdeveloped during writing because the mechanical effort
is so taxing.
Weaknesses in mathematical ability, known as mathematics disorder or dyscalculia, involve the assimilation of both procedural
knowledge (e.g., calculations) and higher-­order cognitive processes
(e.g., WM) (see Table 49.2). There are many reasons why children
struggle with mathematics (see Chapter 52.1). It may be difficult for
some to grasp and apply math concepts effectively and systematically;
good mathematicians are able to use both verbal and perceptual conceptualization to understand such concepts as fractions, percentages,
equations, and proportion. Children with language dysfunctions
have difficulty in mathematics because they have trouble understanding their teachers’ verbal explanations of quantitative concepts and
operations and are likely to experience frustration in solving word
problems and in processing the vast network of technical vocabulary
in math. Mathematics also relies on visualization. Children who have
difficulty forming and recalling visual imagery may be at a disadvantage. They might experience problems writing numbers correctly,
placing value locations, and processing geometric shapes or fractions.
Children with executive dysfunction may be unable to focus on fine
detail (e.g., operational signs), might take an impulsive approach to
problem solving, engage in little or no self-­monitoring, forget components of the problem, or commit careless errors. When a child’s
memory system is weak, the child might have difficulty recalling
appropriate procedures and automatizing mathematical facts (e.g.,
multiplication tables). Moreover, children with mathematical disabilities can have superimposed mathematics phobias; anxiety over
mathematics can be especially debilitating.

Nonacademic Problems

The impulsivity and lack of effective self-­monitoring of children with
executive dysfunction can lead to unacceptable actions that were unintentional. Children struggling with neurodevelopmental dysfunction
can experience excessive performance anxiety, sadness, or clinical
depression; declining self-­esteem; and chronic fatigue. Some children
may lose motivation and feel no need to exert effort and develop future
goals. These children may be easily led toward dysfunctional interpersonal relationships, detrimental behaviors (e.g., delinquency, substance
abuse), and the development of mental health disorders, such as mood
disorders (see Chapter 39) or conduct disorder (see Chapter 42).

ASSESSMENT AND DIAGNOSIS

Pediatricians have a critical role in identifying and treating the child
with neurodevelopmental or executive dysfunction (Fig. 49.1). They
have knowledge of the child’s medical and family history and social-­
environmental circumstances and have the benefit of longitudinal
contact over the course of routine health visits. Focused surveillance
and screening will facilitate early identification of developmental-­
behavioral and preacademic difficulties and interventions to facilitate
optimal outcomes.
A family history of a parent who still struggles with reading or time
management or an older sibling who has failed at school should spur
an increased level of monitoring. Risk factors in the medical history,
such as extreme prematurity or chronic medical conditions, should
likewise be flagged. Children with low birthweight and those born
prematurely who appear to have been spared more serious neurologic
problems might only manifest academic problems later in their school
career. Nonspecific physical complaints or unexpected changes in
behavior might be presenting symptoms. Warning signs might be subtle or absent, and parents might have concerns about their child’s learning progress but may be reluctant to share these with the pediatrician
unless prompted, such as through completion of standardized developmental screening questionnaires or direct questioning regarding
possible concerns. Concerns voiced to parents or caregivers by daycare,
preschool, or early elementary teachers might be the first indicators
of neurodevelopmental dysfunctions. There should be a low threshold
for initiating further school performance screening and assessment if
there are any concerns or “red flags” (see “Clinical Manifestations”).

305

In elementary school, review of school report cards and teacher comments can provide very useful information. In addition to patterns of
grades in the various academic skill areas, it is also important to review
ratings of classroom behavior and work habits. Group-­administered
standardized tests provide further information, although interpretation is required because poor scores could result from a learning
disorder, ADHD, emotional problems, lack of motivation, or some
combination. Conversely, a discrepancy between above-­average scores
on standardized tests and unsatisfactory classroom performance could
signal motivation, adjustment issues, or instructional mismatches.
Challenges related to homework, such as excessive time to complete,
can provide further insight regarding EFs, academic skill, and behavioral factors or factors related to the home environment.
Underlying or associated medical problems should be ruled out. Any
suspicion of sensory difficulty should warrant referral for vision or
hearing testing. The influence of chronic medical problems or potential side effects of medications should be considered. Sleep deprivation
is increasingly being recognized as a contributor to academic problems,
especially in middle and high school. Substance use must always be a
consideration as well, especially in the adolescent previously achieving
well who has shown a rapid decline in academic performance.
The physician should be alert for dysmorphic physical features,
minor congenital anomalies, or constellations of physical findings
(e.g., cardiac and palatal anomalies in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome)
and should perform a detailed neurologic examination, including an
assessment of fine and gross motor coordination and any involuntary
movements or soft neurologic signs. Genetic testing is often recommended for children with intellectual disability or autism spectrum
disorder; electroencephalogram and brain MRI are generally not indicated in the absence of specific medical findings or a family history.
Early signs of executive dysfunction can also be subtle and easily
overlooked or misinterpreted. Informal inquiry might include questions about how children complete schoolwork or tasks, how organized
or disorganized they are, how much guidance they need, whether they
think through problems or respond and react too quickly, what circumstances or individuals affect their ability to employ EFs, how easily
they begin tasks and activities, and how well they plan, manage belongings, and control their emotions.
Pediatricians who are interested in performing further assessment
before referral, or who are practicing in areas where psychologic testing resources are limited, can use standardized rating scales and
inventories or brief, individually administered tests to narrow potential diagnoses and guide next steps in diagnosis and treatment. Such
instruments, completed by the parents, teachers, and the child (if old
enough), can provide information about emotions and behavior, patterns of academic performance, and traits associated with specific neurodevelopmental dysfunctions (see Chapter 32). Screening instruments
such as the Pediatric Symptom Checklist and behavioral questionnaires
such as the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Behavior Assessment
System for Children, Third Edition (BASC-­3) can aid in evaluation.
EFs can be further assessed by instruments such as the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Second Edition (BRIEF-­2), which
provides a comprehensive measure of real-­world behaviors that are
closely tied to executive functioning in children age 5-­18 years. Tests
that can be directly administered to gauge intellectual and language
functioning include the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test, Second Edition

5; assessing receptive vocabulary). A relatively brief test of academic
skills is the Wide Range Achievement Test5 (WRAT5). It should be recognized that these are midlevel tests that can provide descriptive estimates of function but are not diagnostic.
Children who are struggling academically are entitled to evaluations in school. Such assessments are guaranteed in the United States
under Public Law 101-­476, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). One increasingly common type of evaluation model
supported by IDEA is referred to as a Response to Intervention (RtI)
model (see Chapter 52.1). In this model, students who are struggling
with academic skills are initially provided research-­based instruction. If a child does not respond to this instruction, an individualized

evaluation by a multidisciplinary team is conducted. Children found
to have attentional dysfunction and other disorders might qualify for
educational accommodations in the regular classroom under Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (504 Plan) or might qualify for
an individualized education program (IEP).
The pediatrician should advise and support parents regarding
steps to request evaluations by the school. Multidisciplinary evaluations are focused primarily on determining whether a student meets
the eligibility criteria for special education services and to assist in
developing an IEP for those eligible for these services. Independent
evaluations can provide second opinions outside the school setting.

The multidisciplinary team should include a psychologist and preferably an educational diagnostician who can undertake a detailed analysis of academic skills and subskills to pinpoint where breakdowns are
occurring in the processes of reading, spelling, writing, and mathematics. Other professionals should become involved, as needed, such as a
speech-­language pathologist, occupational therapist, and social worker.
A mental health specialist can be valuable in identifying family-­based

Chapter 49 u Neurodevelopmental and Executive Function and Dysfunction
present with developmental or cognitive difficulties in the presence
of a medical condition (e.g., epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, childhood cancers/brain tumors, genetic conditions). A neuropsychologic
evaluation involves comprehensive assessment to understand brain
functions across domains. Neuropsychologic data are often analyzed
together with other tests, such as MRI, to look for supporting evidence
of any areas of difficulty (e.g., memory weaknesses associated with
temporal lobe anomalies). Neuropsychologists can also provide more
in-­depth evaluation of EFs. Assessment of EFs is typically completed
in an examination setting using tools specifically designed to identify
any weaknesses in these functions. Although few tools are currently
available to assess EF in preschool-­age children, the assessment of
school-­age children is better established. Problems with EFs should be
evaluated across measures and in different settings, particularly within
the context of the child’s daily demands.

TREATMENT

Treatment for neurodevelopmental and executive dysfunction involves
a multimodal, multidisciplinary “cross-­sector” approach to foster optimal outcomes. This process begins with demystification,
which involves educating the child and family about the nature of the
child’s delay or dysfunction while also identifying a child’s strengths.
The explanation of the dysfunction should be provided in nontechnical language, communicating a sense of optimism for improvement
with appropriate intervention. Children need to have their affinities,
potentials, and talents identified clearly and emphasized as an integral component of the long-­term treatment plan. It is as important to
augment strengths as it is to attempt to remedy deficiencies. Athletic
skills, artistic inclinations, creative talents, and mechanical abilities are
among the potential assets of certain students who are underachieving
academically. Parents and school personnel need to create opportunities for such students to build on these assets. These well-­developed
personal assets can ultimately have implications for the transition into
young adulthood, including career or college selection.
In the clinic setting, the pediatrician plays an important role as a
consultant and advocate in overseeing and monitoring the implementation of a comprehensive multidisciplinary management plan
for children with neurodevelopmental dysfunctions. The primary
care provider should identify and treat any underlying or associated
medical problems that might contribute to neurodevelopmental and
EF dysfunction, such as iron deficiency, elevated lead levels, and sleep
problems, including inadequate sleep related to poor sleep hygiene or
poor quality of sleep (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea). Additionally, the
pediatrician will need to monitor for conditions that often co-­occur
with neurodevelopmental delays and executive dysfunction or that
may develop over time, including anxiety, depression, and substance
use disorder.

Bypass Strategies (Accommodations)

Numerous techniques can enable a child to circumvent neurodevelopmental dysfunctions. Such strategies are typically used in the regular
classroom and can be incorporated into a 504 Plan or IEP. Accommodations change how the child learns, allowing them to access material
and meet the same expectations as their peers. Examples of accommodations include using large print for those with visual impairment and
using a frequency modulation (FM) system for students with hearing
impairment. For children with learning disorders, accommodations
may include using a calculator while solving mathematical problems,
writing essays with a word processor and use of spellcheck, or presenting oral instead of written reports. Children with executive dysfunction
might benefit from being seated near the teacher to minimize distractions and taking tests untimed. These bypass strategies do not cure
neurodevelopmental dysfunctions, but they minimize their academic
and nonacademic effects and can provide a scaffold for more successful
academic achievement.

Curriculum Modifications

Many children with neurodevelopmental dysfunctions require alterations in the school curriculum to succeed, especially as they progress

307

through secondary school. A modification changes what the child is
taught or expected to learn. Modifications include a student learning
different material (e.g., continuing to work on addition and subtraction facts while peers move on to fractions) and instructors assigning
grades using a different standard. In high school and college, students
with memory weaknesses might need to work with an advisor to select
courses that avoid an inordinate cumulative memory load in any single
semester. For adolescents with learning disorders, the timing of foreign language learning and the selection of mathematics and science
courses are critical to their academic success.

Remediation/Targeted Intervention

Interventions can be implemented at home and in school to strengthen
academic skills. Early identification is critical so that appropriate
instructional interventions can be introduced to minimize the long-­
term effects of academic disorders. Any interventions should be
empirically supported (e.g., phonologically based reading intervention
has been shown to significantly improve reading skills in school-­age
children). Remediation may take place in a resource room or learning center at school and is usually limited to children who have met
the educational criteria for special education services described earlier.
Reading specialists, mathematics tutors, and other professionals can
use diagnostic data to select techniques that use a student’s neurodevelopmental strengths to improve decoding skills, writing ability, or mathematical computation skills. Remediation need not focus exclusively
on specific academic areas. Many students need assistance in acquiring
study skills, cognitive strategies, and productive organizational habits.
Speech-­language pathologists offer intervention for children with
various forms of language disability. Occupational therapists focus on
sensorimotor skills, including the motor skills of students with writing
problems, and physical therapists address gross motor incoordination.

Treatment of Executive Dysfunction

Interventions to strengthen EFs can be implemented throughout childhood but are most effective if started at a young age. Preschool-­age
children first learn EFs by way of the modeling, boundaries, and rules
observed and put in place by their parents/caregivers, and this modeled
behavior must gradually become “internalized” by the child. Early play
has been shown to be effective in promoting executive skills in younger
children with games such as peek-­a-­boo (WM); pat-­a-­cake (WM and
IC); follow the leader, Simon Says, and “Ring Around the Rosie” (self-­
control); imitation activities (attention and impulse control); matching
and sorting games (organization and attention); and imaginary play
(attention, WM, IC, self-­monitoring, cognitive flexibility).
In school-­age children it is crucial to establish consistent cognitive
and behavioral routines that foster and maximize independent, goal-­
oriented problem solving and performance through mechanisms that
include modification of the child’s environment, modeling and guidance with the child, and positive reinforcement strategies. Interventions should promote generalization (teaching executive routines in
the context of a problem, not as a separate skill) and should move from
the external to the internal (from “external support” with active and
directive modeling to an “internal process”). An intervention could
proceed from external modeling of multistep problem-­solving routines and external guidance in developing and implementing everyday
routines, to practicing application and use of routines in everyday situations, to a gradual fading of external support and cueing of internal
generation and use of executive skills. Such approaches should make
the child a part of intervention planning, should avoid labeling, reward
effort not outcomes, make interventions positive, and hold the child
responsible for his or her efforts. Studies have consistently shown that
a combination of medication and behavioral treatments are most
effective, although evidence for long-­term efficacy is lacking. It is
important that any treatment plans aimed at bolstering attention and
EF also include interventions that address the specific deficits associated with any comorbid diagnoses.
In addition to behavioral approaches, cognitive training, both computerized and noncomputerized, has been shown to strengthen the
cognitive skills on which one is trained. Some computerized training

308 Part IV u Learning and Developmental Disorders
programs show lasting improvements in WM skills in children, though
benefits are narrow and limited only to the aspects of WM specifically trained. Recently, game-­based digital therapy has been shown to
improve attention in children with ADHD-­inattentive type and combined type. Noncomputerized cognitive training has shown greater
improvements in EF than any type of computerized cognitive training.
This may be the result of instructor-­trainee interaction. Also evidencing positive outcomes are curriculum-­based classroom programs,
such as the Tools of the Mind (Tools) and Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies (PATHS), which have been shown to improve IC.
Emerging evidence suggests physical activity can improve EF. Children who are more physically active and have better aerobic fitness
have been shown to have better EF than children who are sedentary.
Although plain aerobic exercise (e.g., walking, running) has not been
found to improve EF, encouraging findings have been noted when an
activity involves aerobic exercise and is also cognitively demanding.
Basketball and dance, for example, are high in physical exertion while
also requiring cognitive engagement through motor coordination
and planning. In contrast, resistance training has not been shown to
improve EF.
Approaches that use mindfulness techniques are also gaining prominence. Mindfulness practices incorporating movement (e.g., tai chi)
improve EF better than those performed in a seated position. Martial
arts such as taekwondo, which stresses discipline and self-­regulation,
have demonstrated improvements that generalize in many aspects of
EFs and attention (e.g., sustained focus).

COUNSELING AND PARENT TRAINING PROGRAMS

The pediatrician is often in a close, trusting relationship with families and is well-­positioned to identify adverse home factors that may
require additional supports, including counseling and parent training.

When academic difficulties are complicated by family problems or
identifiable psychiatric disorders, psychotherapy may be indicated.
Mental health professionals may offer long-­term or short-­term therapy. Such intervention may involve the child alone or the entire family. Cognitive-­behavioral therapy is especially effective for mood and
anxiety disorders. It is essential that the therapist have a firm understanding of the nature of a child’s neurodevelopmental dysfunctions.
Formal parenting interventions have also demonstrated strong evidence for effectiveness. Four programs that have the most empirical
support are the Triple P, Parent-­Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT),
Incredible Years, and New Forest Parenting Programme.
Table 49.3 outlines interventions to target the specific components
of EF. Although interventions may target each component separately,
success will be determined by how well treatments can be integrated
across settings and generalized to other areas of function. Whenever
possible, working with more than one EF simultaneously is encouraged as a means of scaffolding intervention and building on previously
mastered skills.

Medication

Psychopharmacologic agents may be helpful in lessening the toll of
some neurodevelopmental dysfunctions. Most often, stimulants are
used in the treatment of children with attention deficits. Although
most children with attention deficits have other associated dysfunctions, such as language disorders, memory problems, motor weaknesses, or social skill deficits, medications such as methylphenidate,
dextroamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, and mixed amphetamine salts,
as well as nonstimulants such as α2-­adrenergic agonists and atomoxetine, can be important adjuncts to treatment by helping some children
focus more selectively and control their impulsivity. When depression
or excessive anxiety is a significant component of the clinical picture,

Attention-­Deficit/­
Hyperactivity Disorder
Elizabeth B. Harstad
Attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most
common and extensively studied neurobehavioral disorders of childhood and is among the most prevalent chronic health conditions
affecting school-­age children. ADHD is characterized by inattention,
including increased distractibility and difficulty sustaining attention;
poor impulse control and decreased self-­inhibitory capacity; and
motor overactivity and restlessness (Table 50.1, Fig. 50.1). Definitions vary in different countries. In the International Classification
of Diseases (ICD) 2022 update from ICD-­10 to ICD-­11, hyperkinetic
disorder was replaced with ADHD, which aligns with Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-­5) terminology. Under ICD-­11, the essential features of ADHD are described,
but without giving age of onset, duration, or minimum number of
symptoms needed for the diagnosis as specified in DSM-­5 (Table
50.2). Children with ADHD may experience academic underachievement, problems with interpersonal relationships with family members and peers, and low self-­esteem. ADHD often coexists with other
emotional, behavioral, language, and learning disorders. Evidence
also suggests that for many people, the disorder continues, with varying manifestations across the life cycle, leading to significant underemployment and unemployment, social dysfunction, and increased
risk of antisocial behaviors (e.g., substance abuse), difficulty maintaining relationships, encounters with the law, and death from suicide
or accidents (Figs. 50.2 and 50.3).

309

EPIDEMIOLOGY

Studies of the prevalence of ADHD worldwide have generally reported
that 5–10% of school-­age children are affected, although rates vary
considerably by country, perhaps in part because of differing sampling
and testing techniques and a varying symptom threshold for diagnosis.
ADHD is more common in males than in females (male to female ratio
4:1 for the predominantly hyperactive-­impulsive presentation and 2:1
for the predominantly inattentive presentation). Many children with
ADHD will have coexisting diagnoses, including learning disabilities,
mood disorders, and/or language disorders. Children with high intellectual quotient (IQ) are just as likely to have ADHD as those with
average IQ, but children with below-­average IQ have increased risk of
having coexisting ADHD.

ETIOLOGY

There is no single etiology identified for ADHD; many factors play
a role in its development. A genetic contribution to the etiology of
ADHD is well established. Twin studies show 70–80% heritability, and
there is a 5-­to 10-­fold increased risk for ADHD among first-­degree
relatives of those with ADHD. However, there are many ways in which
genetic variants contribute to ADHD; it is thought that ADHD is a
polygenic disorder in which multiple common genetic variants act
together to increase the risk for ADHD.
Structural and functional abnormalities of the brain have been identified in children with ADHD. These include dysregulation of the frontal subcortical circuits; small cortical volumes in this region or more
widespread throughout the brain; and abnormalities of the cerebellum,
particularly midline/vermian elements. There is a median of a 3-­year
delay in attainment of peak cortical thickness in prefrontal regions
of the brain in those with ADHD. Although neuroimaging studies have advanced knowledge related to ADHD, neuroimaging does
not typically have a role in the clinical diagnosis or inform ongoing
management.
Brain catecholamine metabolism, specifically for dopamine and norepinephrine, appears to play a role in the pathophysiology of ADHD.
Animal studies suggest that an imbalance between these systems
(specifically a decrease in inhibitory dopamine activity and increase
in norepinephrine activity) contributes to ADHD. These findings are
supported by human studies showing that individuals with ADHD
have an increase in dopamine transporter density (which clears away
dopamine too quickly) compared to non-­ADHD controls. Additionally, studies showing that stimulant medications work to treat ADHD
by increasing the amount of available dopamine and norepinephrine at
the synapse support a role for catecholamine metabolism in the etiology of ADHD.
Some environmental factors also may contribute to the pathogenesis of ADHD. Prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke or alcohol is
associated with increased risk for ADHD. Prematurity, including even
late-­preterm birth, is also associated with increased risk for ADHD.
Maternal mental illness increases the risk for ADHD in offspring, and
research indicates underlying maternal mental illness itself, rather
than treatment of the mental illness, is the associated risk factor. Diet
is not thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of ADHD for most
children with the condition. A small subset of children with ADHD
may be uniquely sensitive to certain foods, sugars, or additives, but this
remains controversial, as studies reporting these findings are typically
small and often not rigorously designed.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Development of the DSM-­5 criteria for ADHD has occurred mainly in
field trials with children 5-­12 years of age (see Table 50.1). The DSM-­5
criteria state that the inattentive or hyperactive-­
impulsive behaviors must be developmentally inappropriate (substantially different
from that of other children of the same age and developmental level),
must begin before age 12 years, must be present for at least 6 months,
must be present in two or more settings, and must not be secondary
to another disorder. To meet criteria for ADHD, the symptoms must
interfere with social, academic, or occupational functioning.

DSM-­5 identifies three presentations of ADHD: the inattentive presentation, hyperactive-­impulsive presentation, and combined presentation. Clinical manifestations of ADHD may change with age; thus the
specific ADHD presentation for an individual may not be stable over
time but describes current symptomatology (see Fig. 50.2). The symptoms may vary from motor restlessness and aggressive and disruptive
behavior, which are common in preschool children, to disorganized,
distractible, and inattentive symptoms, which are more typical in older
adolescents and adults. Although hyperactivity generally decreases in
late childhood and adolescence, symptoms of impulsivity and inattention often persist. Females with ADHD are relatively more likely than
males to be diagnosed with the inattentive presentation, and this presentation is more commonly associated with internalizing symptoms
(anxiety and low mood).

DIAGNOSIS

An evaluation for ADHD should be initiated in any child ≥4 years
of age with symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity (Fig. 50.4). This evaluation includes a careful history and

clinical interview to rule in ADHD or to identify other causes or
contributing factors, completion of behavior rating scales by different observers from at least two settings (e.g., teacher and parent),
and a physical examination. It is important to systematically gather
and evaluate information from a variety of sources, including the
child, parents, teachers, and, when appropriate, other caretakers or
professionals involved in the child’s care.
The evaluation for ADHD may require several office visits. A thorough assessment should be conducted at the time of initial diagnosis,
and reevaluation should occur if there are worsening or new symptoms, given the common occurrence of coexisting conditions.

Clinical Interview and History

The clinical interview allows a comprehensive understanding of
whether the symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD and to
assess for coexisting conditions. The interview should collect information about the history and duration of presenting problems, the
child’s attainment of developmental milestones, school performance,
social skills, mood, sleep, medical illnesses, sensory impairments, or

medication use that might affect the child’s functioning. Disruptive
social factors, such as family discord, situational stress, and abuse or
neglect, can result in hyperactive or anxious behaviors. A family history of first-­degree relatives with ADHD, mood or anxiety disorders,
learning disability, antisocial disorder, or alcohol or substance abuse
might indicate an increased risk of ADHD and coexisting conditions.

Behavior Rating Scales

Behavior rating scales can help to elicit information about ADHD
symptoms across contexts (i.e., home and school). The Vanderbilt
ADHD Rating Scale (which has parent and teacher versions) is a
commonly used screening measure for ADHD in primary care. It
has specific questions about inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity that correspond directly with the DSM-­5 ADHD diagnostic
criteria and questions about overall performance to assess for functional impairment, as well as subscales for some common coexisting
conditions (anxiety/depression and oppositional behaviors/conduct
disorder). Additional ADHD-­specific rating scales include the Conners 3 ADHD Index and ADHD Rating Scale 5, among others that can
be used. Broadband rating scales (such as Achenbach Child Behavior
Checklist [CBCL] or Behavioral Assessment Scale for Children [BASC]
or Conners 3 Full Length Forms) can be useful in assessing for coexisting conditions. Electronic capture of rating scale information is
increasingly available and may facilitate completion and scoring. Rating scales provide information about the type, frequency, and severity
of ADHD or other behavioral/mood symptoms, but interpretation
requires clinical judgement. Contextual factors (such as triggers for a
certain behavior, responses to a behavior that may inadvertently reinforce it) should be considered when interpreting rating scales. When
there are discrepancies between results of rating scales for parents
and teachers, the context and level of support provided in each setting
should be assessed. ADHD rating scales can help with both the initial
diagnostic assessment and with monitoring treatment response over
time. Although there is no universal standard to use as a criterion
for a positive response to treatment in terms of rating scale results,
a decrease in ADHD symptom scores by 25% or more is generally
considered significant improvement. However, improvement in functional outcomes may be more important to consider than changes in
symptom scores. For children on medication, it is important to consider if the medication was “active” when the child was observed (i.e.,
stimulant medication may work to reduce ADHD symptoms during
the school day, but the symptoms may return as the medication wears
off in the afternoon/evening when the child is home).

Physical Examination, Laboratory, and Other
Assessments

Most children with ADHD will have a normal physical exam, but one
should be conducted as part of the diagnostic evaluation. Particular
attention should be paid to cardiac and neurologic evaluations, thyroid, hearing and vision, and assessment for dysmorphic features that
may signify an underlying condition, such as fetal alcohol syndrome.
A child’s behavior in the clinic visit may not represent the child’s usual
behaviors, as some children may be able to remain focused or calm
for brief periods and others may exhibit more impulsivity or high
activity level when nervous in the context of a clinic visit. Laboratory
tests and brain imaging are not routinely recommended as part of an
ADHD assessment. The presence of hypertension, ataxia, or asymmetric neurologic examination or symptoms of a sleep, seizure, or thyroid disorder may prompt further diagnostic tests. Lead levels could
be considered if there are other factors associated with risk for lead
toxicity. The clinician should identify possible vision or hearing problems. Computerized attentional tasks and quantitative electroencephalographic assessments are not needed to make the diagnosis. They are
subject to high rates of false-­positive and false-­negative results and thus
are of limited utility in the diagnostic assessment.
Educational testing should be considered if there are concerns
about academic progress, as specific learning disabilities in reading,

Chapter 50 u Attention-­Deficit/­Hyperactivity Disorder
mathematics, or written expression often coexist with ADHD (see
Chapters 51 and 52). If there has been slow attainment of developmental milestones, intelligence or developmental testing should be
conducted. If there are concerns about a child’s social communication skills combined with restricted, repetitive behaviors or interests,
a clinical assessment for autism spectrum disorder may be indicated
(see Chapter 58).

Differential Diagnosis and Coexisting Conditions

Given that the symptoms of ADHD can overlap with other conditions,
a broad differential diagnosis should be considered. For ease of presentation, the differential diagnosis for ADHD can be grouped into
specific categories of developmental, psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial (Table 50.3). Children at either end of the developmental/
cognitive level (i.e., with significant cognitive delays or with superior
intelligence) can appear inattentive and/or distracted and sometimes
also disruptive if the material in school or expectations at home are not
appropriate for their developmental level. In differentiating impulsivity
and challenging behaviors associated with ADHD versus an externalizing disorder (oppositional defiant disorder [ODD] or conduct disorder), consider whether the child “acts without thinking” and/or is more
reactive (easily upset over demands for sustained attention or other
small triggers), which would be more consistent with ADHD, versus
proactively looks to aggress, fight, and challenge authority, which may
be indicative of an externalizing disorder. Tic disorders can both present with some symptoms similar to ADHD (e.g., fidgeting, squirming,
making sounds that seem impulsive) and also commonly coexist with
ADHD. For cases in which ADHD symptoms are reported in one setting but not another, psychosocial causes should be considered, such
as unrealistic classroom expectations, distress at home, or untoward
parenting strategies. However, clinicians should be aware that inappropriate parenting strategies may be the result of the child’s ADHD, as
parents try anything (often unsuccessfully) to help their child. These
parents are in need of parenting and behavioral supports, without feeling blamed for their child’s symptoms.

behavioral and emotional symptoms that can resemble or exacerbate
ADHD (see Chapter 31). Periodic leg movements of sleep/restless legs
syndrome have been associated with symptoms of inattention, and
inquiry regarding this should be made during the history. Behavioral
and emotional disorders can cause disrupted sleep patterns as well.
Mental health disorders: Depression and anxiety disorders can
cause many of the same symptoms as ADHD (inattention, restlessness,
inability to focus and concentrate on work, poor organization, forgetfulness) but can also coexist with ADHD (see Chapters 38 and 39).
Obsessive-­compulsive disorder can mimic ADHD, particularly when
recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses, or images are intrusive,
interfering with normal daily activities. Adjustment disorders secondary to major life stresses (death of a close family member, parents’
divorce, family violence, parents’ substance abuse, or a move) or parent–child relationship disorders involving conflicts over discipline,
overt child abuse and/or neglect, or overprotection can result in symptoms similar to those of ADHD.
When considering a new diagnosis in an adolescent patient, there
should be an opportunity to interview the adolescent privately, and
the adolescent should be specifically asked about mood symptoms and
psychosocial stressors; frequent digital media use; and screened for use
of alcohol, marijuana, and illicit substances.

TREATMENT
Overall Treatment Approach

ADHD is considered a chronic condition and should be managed as
such, with education about ADHD at the time of diagnosis and regular
follow-­up visits to monitor and treat symptoms. Parent support groups
with appropriate professional consultation to such groups can be
very helpful. Treatment of ADHD should be multimodal and involve
behavioral therapy, school-­based supports, and/or medications. The
treatment plan should be developed in collaboration with the child (if
developmentally appropriate) and family. The recommended initial
treatments for ADHD vary by age.
Preschool-­age children: For children up until 6 years of age, the
recommended first-­line treatment is evidence-­based parent-­and/or
teacher-­administered behavior therapy. If behavior interventions do
not provide significant improvements and there is moderate to severe
impairment in the child’s functioning as a result of ADHD symptoms,
medication should be considered. If behavioral interventions are not
available, the risks of medication should be compared with risks of not
treating ADHD symptoms.
School-­age children and adolescents: For children ages 6 years old
and older, ADHD medications should be considered first-­line treatment, along with behavior and educational interventions. Organizational skills training, coaching, or cognitive-­behavioral therapy may be
helpful for adolescents and adults.

Behaviorally Oriented Treatments

Behavioral interventions should be an integral part of the treatment plan
for all children with ADHD. Behavioral interventions involve modifying the environment and empowering caregivers with strategies to promote positive behaviors and minimize negative behaviors. Behavioral
strategies typically focus on promoting a limited number of well-­defined
appropriate behaviors, using positive reinforcement with increased adult
attention, tangible rewards, or access to privileges. A token economy in
which a child earns (or loses) tokens that can be exchanged for rewards
may be used. Any rules should be clearly defined and consistently
enforced. Behavioral parent training, also known as parent training in
behavioral management, is a well-­established combination of behavioral
interventions shown to reduce problematic behaviors and improve adaptive skills for children with ADHD. It involves teaching parents how to
use behavior modification strategies to address specific behaviors, with
a strong emphasis on positive reinforcement (described earlier) while
ignoring or, if necessary, systematically implementing appropriate consequences for maladaptive behaviors. Treatments geared toward behavioral management for ADHD often occur in the time frame of 8-­12
sessions but may sometimes require more sessions.

314 Part IV u Learning and Developmental Disorders
Although there is much less research published on psychosocial
treatments for adolescents with ADHD, behavioral parent training
can be modified to focus on improving communication between
parents and adolescents with ADHD, developing a behavioral contract, and problem-­solving around challenging situations. For children and adolescents with ADHD and coexisting anxiety disorders
and/or depression, cognitive-­behavioral therapy may help address
anxiety or low mood.
At least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise is recommended for the general health of all children ≥6 years old, and some
studies indicate exercise may reduce ADHD symptoms in children;
thus encouraging regular exercise is reasonable. Interventions including cognitive training, electroencephalogram (EEG) biofeedback, and
diet modification do not have the level of evidence needed to recommend them for most children.

Educational Supports and Accommodations

Behavioral classroom management strategies can be used by teachers to implement strategies within the whole classroom that will
help children with ADHD. These include clear expectations and
consistency in follow-­
through, positive reinforcement for work
completion and on-­task behaviors, and appropriate consequences
when rules are not followed. Additionally, children with ADHD may
benefit from individualized educational supports and accommodations, such as preferential seating near the source of instruction and
away from distractions, motor breaks as needed, frequent teacher
check-­ins, being able to take tests in a less distracting environment,
and an individualized positive behavior plan. A daily report card or
communication log can be used to facilitate regular communication
between the parents and teachers. A daily report card is individually designed for each child to include target problem behaviors in
academic and/or social domains in the classroom (e.g., following
directions, turning in work, getting along with others). The teacher
provides a rating for each behavior on the report card, which is sent
home daily, and the child is given home-­based rewards for meeting
goals set for the ratings from school.
Children with ADHD often need explicit instruction in organization and executive functioning skills and may not develop these
skills at the same pace as non-­ADHD peers. The use of an agenda
book to record assignments, color coding for different classes, and
teacher check-­ins regularly to help with organization may be helpful for some children, and others may require a higher level of more
individualized instruction in the executive functioning domains
of staying organized, planning, initiating tasks, shifting gears, and
self-­monitoring.
Children with ADHD and coexisting learning disorders, communication or developmental delays, significant mental health or oppositional challenges, or autism spectrum disorder often need more
specialized educational supports than those that can be provided
through accommodations in a general classroom. In the United States,
these children would qualify to have an individualized educational
plan (IEP) developed through the public school system.

Medications

Before medication initiation, a history and physical examination
and an assessment for baseline sleep, eating, and mood should be
conducted because these need to be monitored for a child on medication. Children with ADHD and their families should be educated
on the benefits, risks, and side effects of medication, with a discussion about goals and expectations for medication treatment.
It is common for a child to need to try several trials of different
medications or doses to find the optimal ADHD pharmacologic
treatment that both reduces core ADHD symptoms and is well tolerated. ADHD rating scales can be used to assess for medication
effectiveness and side effects, both at initiation and during medication maintenance, and should be collected from parents and teachers when possible.
The types of medications used to treat ADHD fall into one of
the following three categories: stimulants, norepinephrine reuptake

inhibitors, and α2-­adrenergic agonists. Stimulants are the most
commonly used medications to treat ADHD and have been used
to treat this condition since the 1930s. Stimulant medications have
a slightly larger treatment effect size (standardized mean difference) than nonstimulants (approximately 1.0 for stimulants versus
approximately 0.7 for both norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and
α2-­adrenergic agonists). Although stimulants are generally recommended as the first-­line ADHD medication, nonstimulant medications may be considered in the context of active substance use
disorder for an adolescent with ADHD or household family member
or if there is a strong family desire for a nonstimulant medication.
Stimulants have been found to have relatively high rates of adverse
effects (particularly moodiness and irritability) in preschool-­age
children and in children with intellectual disability or autism spectrum disorder, leading some physicians to choose nonstimulant
medication in these situations, as described later.
When starting a stimulant, the clinician can select either a
methylphenidate-­based or an amphetamine-­based medication. The
decision about which stimulant medication to use for a specific child
or adolescent with ADHD is often based on factors such as duration of action (short, intermediate, long acting), preparation (pills,
capsules that can be swallowed whole or whose contents can be
“sprinkled” into food, chewable tablets, and liquids), and clinician
preference or insurance company formularies. Stimulant medications
have a rapid onset of action (ranging from about 20 minutes to up to
an hour, depending on the formulation), and most leave the system
within 3-­12 hours, depending on if they are short, intermediate, or
long acting. A child who responds poorly to one stimulant medication may do well with a different medication in that class or the other
class (methylphenidate versus amphetamine). Stimulant medications
should be initiated at the lowest available dose and titrated upward,
assessing for both effectiveness and side effects, until reaching a dose
that reduces ADHD symptoms and has minimal to no side effects.
Common side effects of stimulant medication include decreased
appetite, headaches, stomachaches, and difficulty falling asleep. If
mood lability occurs, it should be noted whether this is while the
stimulant medication is active (which may indicate that a different
medication should be tried instead) or as the medication is wearing
off (also called rebound and may indicate that a short-­acting preparation should be replaced by a longer-­acting preparation or a low
dose of a short-­acting preparation should be added about 30 minutes
before the onset of the rebound symptoms).
Height, weight, pulse, and blood pressure should be periodically
monitored. Stimulants may be associated with a slight reduction in
linear growth, although studies of the impact of stimulants on adult
height range from findings of a slight impact to no significant difference. Children with decreased appetite from stimulants and difficulty
with weight gain can be counseled to increase caloric intake later in
the day when the appetite returns. Significant reductions (i.e., crossing
two lines on the growth curve) in either height or weight for a child
on stimulant medication may prompt changing to a different ADHD
medication.
Before starting stimulants, children should be screened for symptoms or signs suggestive of a cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease,
cardiac arrhythmias, or a family history of cardiac arrhythmias or sudden death under 50 years of age, and if these symptoms are present, an
electrocardiogram and/or evaluation by a cardiologist to determine if it
is safe to start these medications is recommended. Most children with
tics can be treated with stimulant medication, but occasionally these
medications may exacerbate tics. In these cases, the risks and benefits
of continuing versus changing or stopping the medication should be
considered.
Treatment of ADHD with stimulant medication is associated with
reduced substance use risks. However, stimulant medications themselves are controlled substances with potential for misuse, diversion,
and abuse. Therefore clinicians should regularly counsel adolescent
patients about this risk, the importance of taking the medication only
as prescribed, and about safe medication storage practices (e.g., keeping medication in a secure location).

Chapter 51 u Dyslexia
Two types of selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents: atomoxetine and
viloxazine. These medications take up to 4 weeks to achieve effectiveness and should be taken consistently to be effective. Both atomoxetine
and viloxazine have common side effects of fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, and irritability and a rare potential for suicidal
thinking and behaviors for which the child must be monitored.
α2-­Adrenergic agonist medications include guanfacine and clonidine. Long-­acting preparations of both have U.S. FDA approval for
the treatment of ADHD in children ≥6 years old either as monotherapy or an adjunctive therapy with stimulant medication. Short-­
acting preparations are sometimes used off-­label to treat young
(<6-­year-­old) children with ADHD (especially those with coexisting autism spectrum disorder or sleep disorders). α2-­Adrenergic
agonists may take up to 2 weeks to achieve an initial response.
These medications can also treat motor and vocal tics and so may be
a reasonable choice in a child with a coexisting tic disorder. Common side effects of α2-­adrenergic agonists can include sedation,
headaches, and hypotension, and they should be stopped gradually
because abrupt discontinuation could result in rapid increase in
blood pressure.
Medication alone may not be sufficient to treat ADHD in children, particularly when children have additional psychiatric disorders, developmental disabilities, or significant psychosocial
challenges. When children do not respond to medication, it may be
appropriate to refer them to a mental health specialist. Consultation with a child psychiatrist, developmental-­behavioral pediatrician, or psychologist can be beneficial to determine the next steps
for treatment, including adding other components and supports to
the overall treatment program. Evidence suggests that children who
receive careful medication management, accompanied by frequent
treatment follow-­up, all within the context of an educational, supportive relationship with the primary care provider, are likely to
experience behavioral gains.

PROGNOSIS

More than half of individuals with a childhood diagnosis of ADHD
will manifest a mental health condition (e.g., anxiety, depression,
substance use disorders) in adulthood. Approximately one third to
two thirds of those diagnosed with ADHD in childhood will continue to manifest significant symptoms of ADHD in adulthood. In
children with ADHD, a reduction in hyperactive behavior often
occurs with age. Other symptoms associated with ADHD can
become more prominent with age, such as inattention, impulsivity, and disorganization, and these exact a heavy toll on adolescent
and young adult functioning. Adolescents and young adults with
ADHD have an increased likelihood of risk-­taking behaviors (early
sexual activity, delinquent behaviors, motor vehicle accidents, substance use), seizures, psychosis, educational underachievement or
employment difficulties, and relationship difficulties. With proper
treatment, the risks associated with ADHD, including injuries, can
be significantly reduced. Consistent treatment with medication and
adjuvant therapies appears to lower the risk of adverse outcomes,
such as substance abuse.

Chapter 51

Dyslexia
Sally E. Shaywitz and Bennett A. Shaywitz
DEFINITION

Dyslexia has always been defined as an unexpected difficulty in reading, which has been codified in U.S. Federal law (First Step Act of 2018,
PL: 115–391) as the most up-­to-­date, evidence-­based definition of
dyslexia: “The term dyslexia means an unexpected difficulty in reading
for an individual who has the intelligence to be a much better reader,
most commonly caused by a difficulty in the phonological processing (the appreciation of the individual sounds of spoken language),
which affects the ability of an individual to speak, read, and spell.”
In typical readers, development of reading and intelligence quotient
(IQ) are dynamically linked over time. In dyslexic readers, however, a
developmental uncoupling occurs between reading and IQ (Fig. 51.1),
such that reading achievement is significantly below what would be
expected given the individual’s IQ.
The uncoupling between reading achievement and IQ provides the
long-­sought empirical evidence for the seeming paradox between cognition and reading in individuals with developmental dyslexia, and this
discrepancy is recognized in the federal definition as unexpected difficulty in reading. However, clinicians may see other approaches to diagnosis. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth
Edition (DSM-­5) describes specific learning disorder with impairment
in reading for children with reading skills significantly below those
expected for the child’s age where the deficits are not explained by
intellectual disability, sensory deficits, neurologic disorders, or psychosocial adversity. This definition can be problematic in failing to
differentiate primary problems with reading comprehension from the
reading problems experienced by children with dyslexia despite strong
evidence that the two are distinct. Further, excluding children with
psychosocial adversity is concerning because children who struggle
with reading due to psychosocial adversity suffer similar adverse long-­
term consequences and have been shown to benefit from interventions
designed to help children with dyslexia.

316 Part IV u Learning and Developmental Disorders
EPIDEMIOLOGY

Dyslexia is the most common of the learning disabilities, affecting
80–90% of children identified as having a learning disability. Dyslexia
may be the most common neurobehavioral disorder affecting children,
with prevalence rates ranging from 20% in unselected population-­
based samples to much lower rates in school-­
identified samples.
The low prevalence rate in school-­identified samples may reflect the
reluctance of schools to screen, assess, and identify dyslexia. Dyslexia
occurs with equal frequency in males and females in survey samples in
which all children are assessed. Despite such well-­documented findings, schools continue to identify more males than females, probably
reflecting the more rambunctious behavior of males who come to the
teacher’s attention because of misbehavior, whereas females with reading difficulty, who are less likely to be misbehaving, are also less likely
to be noticed and identified by the schools. Dyslexia fits a dimensional
model in which reading ability and disability occur along a continuum.

PATHOGENESIS

Evidence from a number of lines of investigation indicates that dyslexia
reflects deficits within the language system, and more specifically, within
the phonologic component of the language system engaged in processing the sounds of speech. Individuals with dyslexia have difficulty developing an awareness that spoken words can be segmented into smaller
elemental units of sound (phonemes), an essential ability given that reading requires that the reader map or link printed symbols to their sounds.
Increasing evidence indicates that disruption of attentional mechanisms
may also play an important role in reading difficulties.
Functional brain imaging in both children and adults with dyslexia
demonstrates an inefficient functioning of left hemisphere posterior
brain systems, a pattern referred to as the neural signature of dyslexia
(Fig. 51.2). These differences can be observed before the start of formal
reading instruction, suggesting they represent a biologic predisposition
to reading difficulties as opposed to a result of inadequate instruction.
Although functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) consistently
demonstrates differences between groups of dyslexic compared to typical readers, brain imaging is not able to reliably differentiate an individual case of a dyslexic reader from a typical reader and thus is not
useful in diagnosing dyslexia.

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

mispronunciations, lack of glibness, speech that lacks fluency with
many pauses or hesitations and “ums,” word-­finding difficulties with
the need for time to summon an oral response, and the inability to
come up with a verbal response quickly when questioned; these reflect
sound-­based, not semantic or knowledge-­based, difficulties.
Struggles in decoding and word recognition can vary according to
age and developmental level. The cardinal signs of dyslexia observed
in school-­age children and adults are a labored, effortful approach to
reading involving decoding, word recognition, and text reading. Listening comprehension is typically robust. Older children improve
reading accuracy over time, but without commensurate gains in reading fluency; they remain slow readers. Difficulties in spelling typically
reflect the phonologically based difficulties observed in oral reading.
Handwriting is often affected as well.
History often reveals early subtle language difficulties in dyslexic
children. During the preschool and kindergarten years, at-­risk children
display difficulties playing rhyming games and learning the names for
letters and numbers. Kindergarten assessments of these language skills
can help identify children at risk for dyslexia. Although a dyslexic child
enjoys and benefits from being read to, the child might avoid reading
aloud to the parent or reading independently.
Dyslexia may coexist with attention-­
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (see Chapter 50); this comorbidity has been documented in both
referred samples (40% comorbidity) and nonreferred samples (15%
comorbidity).

DIAGNOSIS

A large achievement gap between typical and dyslexic readers is evident as early as first grade and persists (Fig. 51.3). These findings provide strong evidence and impetus for early screening and identification
of and early intervention for young children at risk for dyslexia. One
source of potentially powerful and highly accessible screening information is their teacher’s judgment about the child’s reading and reading-­
related skills. Evidence-­based screening can be carried out as early as
kindergarten, and also in grades 1-­3, by the child’s teacher. Their teachers’ responses to a small set of questions (10-­12 questions) predict a
pool of children who are at risk for dyslexia with a high degree of accuracy. This evidence-­based screening takes less than 10 minutes, is completed on a tablet, and is extremely efficient and economical. Children

Reflecting the underlying phonologic weakness, children and
adults with dyslexia manifest problems in both spoken and written language. Spoken language difficulties are typically manifest by

Chapter 51 u Dyslexia
found to be at risk will then have further assessment and, if diagnosed
as dyslexic, should receive evidence-­based intervention.
Dyslexia is a clinical diagnosis, and history is especially critical. The
clinician seeks to determine through history, observation, and psychometric assessment if there are unexpected difficulties in reading (based
on the person’s intelligence, chronologic/grade, level of education, or
professional status) and associated linguistic problems at the level of
phonologic processing. No single test score is pathognomonic of dyslexia. The diagnosis of dyslexia should reflect a thoughtful synthesis of
all clinical data available.
Dyslexia is distinguished from other disorders that can prominently
feature reading difficulties by the unique, circumscribed nature of the
phonologic deficit, one that does not intrude into other linguistic or
cognitive domains. A core assessment for the diagnosis of dyslexia in
children includes tests of language, particularly phonology; reading,
including real and pseudowords; reading fluency; spelling; and tests of
intellectual ability. Additional tests of memory, general language skills,
and mathematics may be administered as part of a more comprehensive evaluation of cognitive, linguistic, and academic function.
For informal screening, in addition to a careful history, the
primary care physician in an office setting can listen to the child
read aloud from the child’s own grade-­level reader. Keeping a set
of graded readers available in the office serves the same purpose
and eliminates the need for the child to bring in schoolbooks. Oral
reading is a sensitive measure of reading accuracy and fluency. The
most consistent and telling sign of a reading disability in an accomplished young adult is slow and laborious reading and writing. In
attempting to read aloud, most children and adults with dyslexia
display an effortful approach to decoding and recognizing single
words, an approach in children characterized by hesitations, mispronunciations, and repeated attempts to sound out unfamiliar
words. In contrast to the difficulties they experience in decoding
single words, persons with dyslexia typically possess the vocabulary,
syntax, and other higher-­level abilities involved in comprehension.
Fluency forms the bridge between decoding, that is, reading a
word accurately, and comprehension, understanding what is read.
Fluent reading is reading accurately and rapidly, with good intonation (prosody) indicating an understanding of the text. The failure
either to recognize or to measure the lack of fluency in reading is
perhaps the most common error in the diagnosis of dyslexia, especially in older children and accomplished young adults. Simple
word identification tasks will not detect dyslexia in a person who
is accomplished enough to be in honors high school classes or to
graduate from college or obtain a graduate degree. Tests relying on
the accuracy of word identification alone are inappropriate to use to
diagnose dyslexia because they show little to nothing of the struggle
to read. Because they assess reading accuracy but not automaticity
or prosody, the types of reading tests used for school-­age children
might provide misleading data on bright adolescents and young
adults. Among the most critical tests are those that are timed; they
are the most sensitive in detecting dyslexia in a bright adult. Few
standardized tests for young adult readers are administered under
timed and untimed conditions; the Nelson-­Denny Reading Test is an
exception. The helpful Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE)
examines simple word reading under timed conditions, and the
Achievement Improvement Monitoring System (AIMSweb) and
Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) measure reading connected text under timed conditions. Any scores
obtained on testing must be considered relative to peers with the
same degree of education or professional training.

IS FAMILY HISTORY HELPFUL IN DIAGNOSING
DYSLEXIA?

Although dyslexia is familial, family history is not effective as a screening measure for dyslexia and does not improve the classification accuracy provided by an evidence-­based early screening measure.

317

Genome-­wide association studies (GWASs) in children with dyslexia have demonstrated that a large number of genes are involved,
each producing a small effect. Complex traits such as reading are the
work of thousands of genetic variants working in concert (see Chapter
103). Thus pediatricians should be wary of recommending any genetic
test to their patients that purports to diagnose dyslexia in infancy or
before language and reading have even emerged. It is unlikely that a
single gene or even a few genes will reliably identify people with dyslexia. Rather, dyslexia is best explained by multiple genes, each contributing a small amount toward the expression of dyslexia.

MANAGEMENT

The management of dyslexia demands a life-­span perspective. Early
in life the focus is on remediation of the reading problem. Applying
knowledge of the importance of early language, including phonologic
skills and vocabulary, leads to significant improvements in children’s
reading accuracy, even in predisposed children. As a child matures
and enters the more time-­demanding setting of middle and then
high school, the emphasis shifts to the important role of providing
accommodations. Based on the work of the National Reading Panel,
evidence-­based reading intervention methods and programs are identified. Effective intervention programs provide systematic instruction
in five key areas: phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary,
and comprehension strategies. These programs also provide ample
opportunities for writing, reading, and discussing literature.
Taking each component of the reading process in turn, effective
interventions improve phonemic awareness: the ability to focus on
and manipulate phonemes (speech sounds) in spoken syllables and
words. The elements found to be most effective in enhancing phonemic awareness, reading, and spelling skills include teaching children to manipulate phonemes with letters, focusing the instruction
on one or two types of phoneme manipulations rather than multiple
types, and teaching children in small groups. Providing instruction
in phonemic awareness is necessary, but not sufficient, to teach
children to read. Effective intervention programs include teaching phonics, or making sure that the beginning reader understands
how letters are linked to sounds (phonemes) to form letter-­sound
correspondences and spelling patterns. The instruction should be
explicit and systematic; phonics instruction enhances children’s
success in learning to read, and systematic phonics instruction is
more effective than instruction that teaches little or no phonics or
that teaches phonics casually or haphazardly. Important but often
overlooked is starting children on reading connected text early on,
optimally at or near the beginning of reading instruction. Reading connected text is critical in building vocabulary and increasing background knowledge—both important in improving reading
comprehension.
Fluency is of critical importance because it allows the automatic,
rapid recognition of words. Although it is generally recognized that
fluency is an important component of skilled reading, it is often overlooked in teaching. One approach is to have a child practice oral reading with a teacher or parent providing positive and helpful feedback.
Here practice is critical. Interventions for vocabulary development and
reading comprehension are not as well established. The most effective
methods to teach reading comprehension involve teaching vocabulary
and strategies that encourage active interaction between the reader and
the text. Emerging science indicates that it is not only teacher content
knowledge but the teacher’s skill in engaging the student and focusing
the student’s attention on the reading task at hand that is required for
effective instruction.
The interventions described here can be provided in multiple settings, but specialized schools for children with dyslexia that provide
intensive intervention over 4 years or more have been very effective.
Typically, these schools are costly, although increasingly offering
scholarships. Some school districts are considering developing public
schools specializing in educating children with dyslexia.

318 Part IV u Learning and Developmental Disorders
For those in high school, college, and graduate school, provision of
accommodations most often represents a highly effective approach to
dyslexia. Imaging studies now provide neurobiologic evidence of the
need for extra time for dyslexic students; accordingly, college students
with a childhood history of dyslexia require extra time in reading and
writing assignments and in examinations. Many adolescent and adult
students have been able to improve their reading accuracy, but without
commensurate gains in reading speed. The accommodation of extra
time reconciles the individual’s often high cognitive ability and slow
reading, so that the exam is a measure of that person’s ability rather
than disability. Another important accommodation is helping the
student access text-­to-­speech programs. Excellent text-­to-­speech programs and apps are available for Apple and Android systems and the
PC and include Voice Dream Reader, Immersive Reader (available for
free in all Microsoft Office programs, including Word, OneNote, and
PowerPoint), Kurzweil Firefly, Read & Write Gold, Read: OutLoud, and
Natural Reader. Voice-­to-­text programs are also helpful, often part of
the suite of programs, as well as the popular Dragon Dictate. Voice-­to-­
text is found on many smartphones. Other helpful accommodations
include the use of laptop computers with spelling checkers, access to
lecture notes, tutorial services, and a separate quiet room for taking
tests.
In addition, the impact of the primary phonologic weakness in dyslexia mandates special consideration during oral examinations so that
students are not graded on their lack of glibness or speech hesitancies,
but on their content knowledge. Unfortunately, speech hesitancies or
difficulties in word retrieval often are wrongly confused with insecure
content knowledge. The major difficulty in dyslexia—reflecting problems accessing the sound system of spoken language—causes great
difficulty learning a second language. As a result, an often-­necessary
accommodation is a waiver or partial waiver of the foreign language
requirement; the dyslexic student may enroll in a course taught in English on the history or culture of a non–English-­speaking country.

PROGNOSIS

Application of evidence-­based methods to young children, when provided with sufficient intensity and duration, can result in improvements in reading accuracy and, to a much lesser extent, fluency.
Improvements in fluency can be effected with frequent practice in
reading aloud with the helpful input of a teacher or parent. As noted
earlier, accommodations are critical in allowing the dyslexic child to
demonstrate his or her knowledge.

A person who is dyslexic experiences through life aligns with our
Sea of Strengths model of dyslexia (Fig. 51.4). This model indicates that
in dyslexia there is a weakness in decoding reflecting the difficulties
connecting letters to sounds, a weakness that is very visible early on
when learning to read. At the same, this weakness is surrounded by a
sea of strengths in higher-­level cognitive, big-­picture thinking, including reasoning, problem solving, vocabulary, empathy, concept formation, and critical thinking. It is this sea of strengths that comes to the
fore and supports a positive future as a person with dyslexia matures.
The sea of strengths was very “visible” in a recent report examining the
academic and social experiences in college and outcomes in the workplace 5 or more years after graduation in Yale graduates with dyslexia
compared with a matched group of Yale graduates who were typical
readers. Dyslexic college graduates did not differ from typical graduates either in college or in the workplace. Parents of dyslexic children
often ask about their child’s future. These findings should reassure
those pediatricians and parents that dyslexic students can succeed all
along the developmental pathway throughout school, and now through
college and the workplace. With proper support, dyslexic children can
succeed in a range of future occupations that might seem out of their
reach, including medicine, law, journalism, and writing.

52.1 Math Disabilities
Kenneth L. Grizzle and Brittany J. Bice-­Urbach
Data from the U.S. National Center for Educational Statistics for 2009
showed that 69% of U.S. high school graduates had taken algebra 1,
88% geometry, 76% algebra 2/trigonometry, and 35% precalculus.
These percentages are considerably higher than those from 20 years
earlier. However, concerns remain about the limited mathematics literacy level for children, adolescents, and those entering the workforce;
poor math skills predict numerous social, employment, and emotional
challenges. The need for number and math literacy extends beyond the
workplace and into daily lives, and weaknesses can negatively affect
daily functioning. Research into the etiology and treatment of math
disabilities falls behind the study of reading disabilities (see Chapter
51), and yet the database needed to effectively identify, treat, and minimize the impact of math challenges on daily functioning and education
is growing.

Understanding learning challenges associated with mathematics
requires a basic appreciation of domain-­
specific terminology and
operations. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders,
Fifth Edition (DSM-­5) has published diagnostic criteria for learning
disorders. Specific types of learning challenges are subsumed under the
broad term of specific learning disorder (SLD). The DSM-­5 identifies

Chapter 52 u Math and Writing Disabilities
the following features of a SLD with an impairment in math: difficulties mastering number sense, number facts, or fluent calculation
and difficulties with math reasoning. Symptoms must be present for
a minimum of 6 months and persist despite interventions to address
the learning challenges. Number sense refers to a basic understanding
of quantity, number, and operations and is represented as nonverbal
and symbolic. Examples of number sense include an understanding
that each number is 1 more or 1 less than the previous or following
number, knowledge of number words and symbols, and the ability to
compare the relative magnitude of numbers and perform simple arithmetic calculations.
The DSM-­5 definition can be contrasted with an education-­defined
learning disability in mathematics. Two math-­related areas are identified as part of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
(IDEA): mathematics calculation and mathematics problem solving.
Operationally, this is reflected in age-­level competency in arithmetic
and math calculation, word problems, interpreting graphs, understanding money and time concepts, and applying math concepts to
solve quantitative problems. The federal government allows states to
choose the way a learning disability (LD) is identified if the procedure
is “research based.” Referred to specifically in the IDEA as methods for
identifying an LD are a discrepancy model and “use of a process based
on the child’s response to scientific, research-­based intervention.” The
former refers to identifying an LD based on a pronounced discrepancy
between intellectual functioning and academic achievement. The latter,
referred to as a response to intervention (RtI) model, requires school
systems to screen for a disability, intervene using evidence-­based treatments for the identified disability, closely monitor progress, and make
necessary adjustments to the intervention as needed. If a child is not
responding adequately, a multidisciplinary team is created, and an
evaluation is then completed to determine whether the child qualifies for special education programming. Not responding to the interventions alone does not result in automatic qualification for services
outside of regular education. Rather, it is a three-­step process: lack of
adequate progress to the interventions, an evaluation of the area(s)
of concern, and then determination by the team if an individualized
educational plan (IEP) is needed. The IEP team typically consists of
teachers, special education teacher, school psychologist, school district
representative, parents, and, depending on their age, the student.
It is important that primary care providers understand the RtI process because many states require or encourage this approach to identifying LDs. Confusion can be avoided by helping concerned parents
understand that a school may review their child’s records, screen the
skills of concern, and provide intervention with close progress monitoring before initiating the process for an IEP. Traditional psychoeducation testing (IQ and achievement) may only be completed if a child
has not responded well to specific interventions. The RtI approach is a
valuable, empirically supported way to approach and identify a potential LD but is very different from a medical approach to diagnosis and
treatment. First and foremost, this allows for early intervention, which
has been shown repeatedly to decrease the likelihood of a later identified LD. Intervening early also allows educators to avoid the “wait to
fail” model that all too often waited for children to enter third or fourth
grade before receiving needed services.

Terminology

The term dyscalculia, often used in medicine and research but seldom
used by educators, is reserved for children with a SLD in math when
there is a pattern of deficits in learning arithmetic facts and accurate,
fluent calculations. The term math learning disability (MLD) is used
generically here, with dyscalculia used when limiting the discussion
to children with deficient math calculation skills. A distinction is also
made between children with a MLD and those who are low achieving
(LA) in math; both groups have received considerable research focus.
Although not included in either definition provided earlier, research
into math deficits often require that individuals identified with MLD
have math achievement scores below the 10th percentile across multiple grade levels. These children start out poorly in math and continue poor performance across grades, despite interventions. LA math

319

students consistently score below the 25th percentile on math achievement tests across grades, often showing the same weak math-­related
characteristics as those with MLD but with less severity. Complicating
the identification of MLD and its differentiation from LA math students is the variability in relative complexity of math concepts that may
result in short-­lived math difficulties.

EPIDEMIOLOGY
Prevalence

Depending on how MLD is defined and assessed, the prevalence varies.
Based on findings from multiple studies, approximately 7% of children
will show a MLD profile before high school graduation. An additional
10% of students will be identified as LA. Because research in the area
typically requires that individuals show deficits for consecutive years,
the respective prevalence estimates are lower than the 10th percentile
cutoff for being identified as having an MLD or the 25th percentile
cutoff for being identified as LA. It is not unusual for children to score
below the criterion one year and then above the criterion in subsequent
years. Males are at greater risk to experience MLD.

Risk Factors
Genetics

The heritability of math skills is estimated to be approximately 0.50.
The heritability or genetic influence on math skills is consistent across
the continuum from high to low math skills. This research emphasizes that although math skills are learned across time, the stability of
math performance is the result of genetic influences. Math heritability
appears to be the product of multiple genetic markers, each having a
small effect.

Medical/Genetic Conditions

Numerous genetic syndromes are associated with math problems.
Although most children with fragile X syndrome have an intellectual
disability (ID), approximately 50% of females with the condition do
not. Of those without an ID, ≥75% have a math disability by the end
of third grade and are already scoring below average in mathematics
in kindergarten and first grade. For females with fragile X MLD, weak
working memory seems to play an important role. The frequency of
MLD in Turner syndrome (TS) is the same as that found in females
with fragile X syndrome. A consistent finding is females with TS
complete math calculations at significantly slower speed than typically developing students. Although females with TS have weak calculation skills, their ability to complete math problems not requiring
explicit calculation is similar to that of their peers. The percentage of
children with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2ds) with MLD is
not clear. Younger children with this genetic condition (6-­10 years
old) showed similar number sense and calculation skills as typically
developing children but weaker math problem solving. Older children
with 22q11.2ds showed slower speed in their general number sense
and calculations, but accuracy was maintained. Weak counting skills
and magnitude comparison have been found in this group of children,
suggesting weak visual-­spatial processing. Children with myelomeningocele are at greater risk for math difficulties than their unaffected
peers. Almost 30% of these children have MLD without an additional
diagnosed learning disorder, and >50% have both math and reading
learning disorders. Although broad, deficits are most pronounced in
speed of math calculation and written computation.

Comorbidities

It is estimated that 30–70% of those with MLD will also have a reading disability. This is especially important because children with MLD
are less likely to be referred for additional educational assistance and
intervention than students with reading problems. Unfortunately, children identified with both learning challenges perform poorer across
psychosocial and academic measures than children with MLD alone.
Having a MLD places a child at greater risk for not only other learning
challenges but also psychiatric disorders, including attention-­deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder, conduct
disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder.

320 Part IV u Learning and Developmental Disorders
Individuals with MLD have been found to have increased social isolation and difficulties developing social relationships in general.

CAUSES OF MATH LEARNING DISABILITY

There is a consensus that individuals with MLD are a heterogeneous
group, with multiple potential broad and specific deficits contributing to their learning difficulties. Research into the causes of MLD has
focused on math-­specific processes and broad cognitive deficits, with
an appreciation that these two factors are not always independent.

Broad Cognitive Processes
Intelligence

Intelligence affects learning, but if intellectual functioning were the
primary driver of poor math performance, the math skills of low-­IQ
children would be similar or worse than individuals with MLD. On the
contrary, children with MLD have significantly poorer math achievement than children with low IQ. Children with MLD have severe deficits
in math not accounted for by their cognitive functioning. Individuals
with lower cognition may have difficulty learning mathematics, but
their math skills are likely to be commensurate with their intelligence.

Memory

Working memory (WM) refers to the ability to keep information in
mind while using the information in other mental processes. WM is
composed of three core systems: the central executive, the language-­
related phonologic loop, and the visual-­based sketch pad. The central
executive coordinates the functioning of the other two systems. All
three play a role in various aspects of learning and in the development
and application of math skills in particular; children with MLD have
shown deficits in each area.
Committing math facts to and/or retrieving facts from memory
has consistently been found to be problematic for children with MLD.
This is not necessarily limited to inaccurate retrieval of facts but also
speed of retrieval, independent of broader speed of processing deficits. Unfortunately, unlike some typically developing peers who may
be slower but accurate in their fact retrieval, students with MLD are
often slow and inaccurate. Weak fact encoding or retrieval alone do
not determine an MLD diagnosis. Many math curricula in the United
States do not include development of math facts as a part of the instructional process, resulting in children not knowing basic facts.

Processing Speed

Individuals with MLD are often slower to complete math problems than
their typically developing peers, a result in part of their poor fact retrieval
rather than broader speed of processing deficits. However, young children later identified with a MLD when beginning school have numerical-­
processing speed that is considerably slower than same-­age same-­grade
peers. This is reflected in the time required to recognize numbers, correctly order fractions, and complete word problems.

Problem Solving

Not only do children with MLD struggle to quickly and accurately
engage in numerical-­related activities, in part because of these difficulties, they commonly rely on less efficient and laborious problem-­
solving practices. This is seen in children relying on finger counting
beyond second grade, use of repeated adding for multiplication facts,
pronounced difficulty moving beyond reliance on manipulatives, and
drawing objects to help with calculation. Difficulties with math processes across multiple levels can result in math being a time-­intensive
and time-­consuming process for kids with MLD.

Executive Skills

Difficulties with executive functioning (EF) can lead to challenges in
multiple areas of a child’s life, academic and nonacademic (see Chapter 49). Performance in math is but one example. EF refers to skills
including but not limited to sustained attention, managing impulses,
cognitive and behavioral flexibility, and WM. Anyone who has worked
with children diagnosed with ADHD, a group of kids notorious for
having EF challenges, can appreciate the impact these behaviors could

potentially have on math. Deficits in WM, auditory and visual, can negatively affect a child’s development of math skills. A child approaching
a word problem exemplifies the impact of various executive skills on
math. The child must keep in memory the content read and integrate it
with what they know about the topic and possible operation to apply,
all the while not responding to the irrelevant information contained
within the passage. Creating a mental representation of the problem
requires use of the visual sketch pad (visual WM).

Math-­Specific Processes
Number Sense

The term number sense has been defined in different ways, though the
general agreement is that the concept refers to an intuitive preverbal
ability to identify an approximation of items within a set that precedes
formal math instruction. This is seen in the ability to recognize and
manipulate nonsymbolic properties without having to apply a name to
the process—for example, recognizing that a box of three dots is fewer
than a box containing five dots. Unlike their peers, children with MLD
are more likely to count the number of items within the comparison
rather than recognizing the apparent difference.
Math is a symbolic process and cannot be efficiently learned and
mastered without understanding this numerical skill. There is considerable evidence that young children who struggle to develop symbolic
numerical representation, in contrast to number sense, are at considerable risk to have difficulty developing higher-­level math skills.
Examples of symbolic representations range from recognizing that the
numeral 4 and word four reflect a quantity and quickly recognizing the
larger (or smaller) of two numbers, all the way to understanding fractions and more complex notations.

Procedural Errors

The type of errors made by children with a, MLD are typical for any
child, the difference being that children with a LD show a 2-­to 3-­year
lag in understanding the concept. An example of a common error a
first-­grade child with a, MLD might make when “counting on” is to
undercount: “6 + 2= ?”; “6, 7” rather than starting at 6 and counting
an additional two numbers. As children with math deficits get older,
it is common to subtract a larger number from a smaller number. For
example, in the problem “63 − 29 = 46,” the child makes the mistake
of subtracting 3 from 9. Another common error is not decreasing the
number in the 10s column when borrowing: “64 − 39 = 35.” For both
adding and subtracting, there is a lack of understanding of the commutative property of numbers and a tendency to use repeated addition
rather than fact retrieval. It is not that children with an MLD do not
develop these skills, it is that they develop them much later than their
peers, thereby making the transition to complicated math concepts
much more challenging.
Unlike dyslexia, in which deficits have been isolated and identified as
causal (see Chapter 51), factors involved in the development of a MLD
are much more heterogeneous. Alone, none of the processes previously
outlined fully account for MLD, although all have been implicated as
problematic for those struggling with math.

TREATMENT AND INTERVENTIONS

The most effective interventions for MLD are those that include
explicit instruction on solving specific types of problems and that take
place over several weeks to several months. Skill-­based instruction is a
critical component; general math problem solving will not carry over
across various math skills unless the skill is part of a more complex
math concept. Clear, comprehensive guidelines for effective interventions for students struggling with math have been provided by the
U.S. Department of Education in the form of a Practice Guide released
through the What Works Clearinghouse. This document gives excellent direction in the identification and treatment of children with math
difficulties in the educational system. Although not intended for medical personnel or parents, the guide is available free of charge and can be
helpful for parents when talking to teachers about their child’s learning.

young child’s development of math facts.

A.	Difficulties learning and using academic skills that have persisted
for at least 6 months, despite the provision of interventions that
target those difficulties.
Difficulties with written expression (e.g., makes multiple grammatical
or punctuation errors within sentences; employs poor paragraph
organization; written expression of ideas lacks clarity).
B.	The affected academic skills are substantially and quantifiably
below those expected for the individual’s chronologic age and
cause significant interference with academic or occupational
performance or with activities of daily living, as confirmed by
individually administered standardized achievement measures
and comprehensive clinical assessment. For individuals age 17
years and older, a documented history of impairing learning
difficulties may be substituted for the standardized assessment.
C.	The learning difficulties begin during school-­age years but may
not become fully manifest until the demands for those affected
academic skills exceed the individual’s limited capacities (e.g., as
in timed tests, reading or writing lengthy complex reports for a
tight deadline, excessively heavy academic loads).
D.	The learning difficulties are not better accounted for by intellectual
disabilities, uncorrected visual or auditory acuity, other mental or
neurologic disorders, psychosocial adversity, lack of proficiency in
the language of academic instruction, or inadequate educational
instruction.
315.2 (F81.81) With impairment in written expression:
Spelling accuracy
Grammar and punctuation accuracy
Clarity or organization of written expression
Specify current severity:
Mild: Some difficulties learning skills in one or two academic
domains, but of mild enough severity that the individual may be
able to compensate or function well when provided with appropriate
accommodations or support services, especially during the school
years.
Moderate: Marked difficulties learning skills in one or more academic
domains, so that the individual is unlikely to become proficient
without some intervals of intensive and specialized teaching during
the school years. Some accommodations or supportive services at
least part of the day at school, in the workplace, or at home may be
needed to complete activities accurately and efficiently.
Severe: Severe difficulties learning skills, affecting several academic
domains, so that the individual is unlikely to learn those skills without
ongoing intensive individualized and specialized teaching for most of
the school years. Even with an array of appropriate accommodations
or services at home, at school, or in the workplace, the individual may
not be able to complete all activities efficiently.

Table 52.2  Risk Factors for a Specific Learning Disability
Involving Mathematics
The child is at or below the 20th percentile in any math area, as
reflected by standardized testing or ongoing measures of progress
monitoring.
The teacher expresses concerns about the child’s ability to “take the
next step” in math.
There is a positive family history for math learning disability (this
alone will not initiate an intervention).
Parents think they have to “reteach” math concepts to their child.

Awareness that most public school systems have implemented some
form of an RtI model to identify LDs allows the primary care physician
to encourage parents to return to the school seeking an intervention
to address their child’s concern. Receiving special education services
in the form of an IEP may be necessary for some children. However,
the current approach to identifying children with an LD allows school
systems to intervene earlier, when problems arise, and potentially avoid
the need for an IEP. Pediatricians with patients whose parents have
received feedback from school with any of the risk factors outlined in
Table 52.2 should encourage the parents to discuss an intervention plan
with the child’s teacher.

52.2 Writing Disabilities

From the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed. Washington,
DC: American Psychiatric Association; 2013:66–67.

Kenneth L. Grizzle and Brittany J. Bice-­Urbach
Oral language is a complex process that typically develops in the
absence of formal instruction. In contrast, written language requires
instruction in acquisition (word reading), understanding (reading
comprehension), and expression (spelling and composition). Unfortunately, despite reasonable pedagogy, a subset of children struggle
with development in one or several of these areas. The disordered
output of written language is currently referred to within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition
(DSM-­5) as a specific learning disorder with impairment in written expression (Table 52.3).
Various terminology has been used when referring to individuals
with writing deficits; this subchapter uses the term impairment in
written expression (IWE) rather than “writing disorder” or “disorder of written expression.” Dysgraphia is often used when referring
to children with writing problems, sometimes synonymously with
IWE, though the two are related but distinct conditions. Dysgraphia

is primarily a deficit in motor output (paper/pencil skills), and IWE
is a conceptual weakness in developing, organizing, and elaborating
on ideas in writing.
The diagnoses of IWE and dysgraphia are made largely based on
phenotypical presentation; spelling, punctuation, grammar, clarity, and organization are factors to consider with IWE concerns.
Aside from these potentially weak writing characteristics, however,
no other guidelines are offered. Based on clinical experience and
research into the features of writing samples of children with disordered writing skills, one would expect to see limited output, poor
organization, repetition of content, and weak sentence structure
and spelling despite the child taking considerable time to produce
a small amount of content. For those with comorbid dysgraphia,
the legibility of their writing product will also be poor, sometimes
illegible.

322 Part IV u Learning and Developmental Disorders
EPIDEMIOLOGY

The incidence of IWE is estimated at 6.9–14.7%, with the relative
risk for IWE ∼2.5 times higher for males than for females. The risk
for writing problems is much greater among select populations;
>50% of children with oral language disorders reportedly have
IWE. The relationship between attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and learning disorders in general is well established,
including IWE estimates in the 60% range for the combined and
inattentive presentations of ADHD. Because of the importance of
working memory (WM) and other executive functions in the writing process, any child with weakness in these areas will likely find
the writing process difficult (see Chapter 49).

SKILL DEFICITS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPAIRED
WRITING

Written language, much like reading, occurs along a developmental
trajectory that can be seamless as children master skills critical to
the next step in the process. Mastery of motor control that allows
a child to produce letters and letter sequences frees up cognitive
energy to devote to spelling words and eventually stringing words
into sentences, paragraphs, and complex composition. Early in the
development of each individual skill, considerable cognitive effort
is required, although ideally the lower-­level skills of motor production, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization (referred to as writing mechanics or writing conventions) will gradually become
automatic and require progressively less mental effort. This effort
can then be devoted to higher-­level skills, such as planning, organization, application of knowledge, and use of varied vocabulary. For
children with writing deficits, breakdowns can occur at one, some,
or every stage.

Transcription

Among preschool and primary grade children, there is a wide range
of what is considered “developmentally typical” as it relates to letter
production and spelling. However, evidence indicates that poor writers in later grades are slow to produce letters and write their name in
preschool and kindergarten. Weak early spelling and reading skills (letter identification and phonologic awareness; see Chapter 51) and weak
oral language have also been found to predict weak writing skills in
later elementary grades. Children struggling to master early transcription skills tend to write slowly, or when writing at reasonable speed, the
legibility of their writing degrades. Output in quantity and variety is
limited, and vocabulary use in poor spellers is often restricted to words
they can spell.
As children progress into upper elementary school and beyond,
a new set of challenges arises. They are now expected to have mastered lower-­level transcription skills, and the focus turns to the
application of these skills to more complex text generation. In addition to transcription, this next step requires the integration of additional cognitive skills that have yet to be tapped by young learners.

use of language, including though not limited to greeting and making requests, adjustments to language used to meet the need of the
situation or listener, and following conversation rules verbally and
nonverbally. Higher-­level language goes beyond basic vocabulary,
word form, and grammatical skills and includes making inferences,
understanding and appropriately using figurative language, and
making cause-­and-­effect judgments. Weaknesses in these areas,
with or without intact foundational language, can present challenges
for students in all academic areas that require writing. For example,
whether producing an analytic or narrative piece, the writer must
understand the extent of the reader’s background knowledge and in
turn what information to include and omit, make an argument for
a cause-­and-­effect relationship, and use content-­specific vocabulary
or vocabulary rich in imagery and nonliteral interpretation.

Executive Functions

Writing is a complicated process and, when done well, requires the
effective integration of multiple processes. Executive functions (EFs)
are a set of skills that include planning, problem solving, monitoring,
and adjusting as needed (see Chapter 49). Three recursive processes
have consistently been reported as involved in the writing process:
translation of thought into written output, planning, and reviewing.
Coming up with ideas, although challenging for many, is simply the
first step when writing a narrative (story). Once an idea has emerged,
the concept must be developed to include a plot, characters, and storyline and then coordinated into a coherent whole that is well organized and flows from beginning to end. Even if one develops ideas and
begins to write them down, persistence is required to complete the task,
which requires self-­regulation. Effective writers rely heavily on EFs, and
children with IWE struggle with this set of skills. Poor writers seldom
engage in the necessary planning and struggle to self-­monitor and
revise effectively.

Working Memory

WM refers to the ability to hold, manipulate, and store information for short periods. The more space available, the more memory
can be devoted to problem solving and thinking tasks. Nevertheless, there is limited space in which information can be held, and
the more effort devoted to one task, the less space is available to
devote to other tasks. WM has consistently been shown to play an
important role in the writing process, because weak WM limits the
Text Generation
(Words, sentences, discourse)

Working Memory

Oral Language

Language, though not speech, has been found to be related to writing skills. Writing difficulties are associated with deficits in both
expression and comprehension of oral language. Writing characteristics of children with specific language impairment (SLI) can differ from their unimpaired peers early in the school experience and
persist through high school (see Chapter 53). In preschool and kindergarten, as a group, children with language disorders show poorer
letter production and ability to print their name. Poor spelling and
weak vocabulary also contribute to the poor writing skills. Beyond
primary grades, the written narratives of SLI children tend to be
evaluated as “lower quality with poor organization” and weaker use
of varied vocabulary.
Pragmatic language and higher-­level language deficits also negatively affect writing skills. Pragmatic language refers to the social

space available. Further, when writing skills that are expected to be
automatic continue to require effort, precious memory is required,
taking away what would otherwise be available for higher-­level
language.
The Simple View of Writing is an approach that integrates each
of the four ideas just outlined to describe the writing process (Fig.
52.1). At the base of the triangle are transcription and EFs, which
support, within WM, the ability to produce text. Breakdowns in
any of these areas can lead to poor writing, and identifying where
the deficit(s) are occurring is essential when deciding to treat the
writing problem. For example, children with weak graphomotor skills (e.g., dysgraphia) must devote considerable effort to the
accurate production of written language, thereby increasing WM
use devoted to lower-­level transcription and limiting memory that
can be used for developing discourse. The result might be painfully
slow production of a legible story or a passage that is largely illegible. If, on the other hand, a child’s penmanship and spelling have
developed well but their ability to persist with challenging tasks or
to organize their thoughts and develop a coordinated plan for their
paper is limited, one might see very little information written on
the paper despite considerable time devoted to the task. Lastly, even
when skills residing at the base of this triangle are in place, students with a language disorder will likely produce text that is more
consistent with their language functioning than their chronologic
grade or age.

TREATMENT

Poor writing skills can improve with effective treatment. Weak
graphomotor skills may not necessarily require intervention from
an occupational therapist (OT), although Handwriting Without
Tears is a curriculum frequently used by OTs when working with
children with poor penmanship. An empirically supported writing program has been developed by Berninger, but it is not widely
used inside or outside school systems (PAL Research-­Based Reading
and Writing Lessons). Her research suggests that for children with
dysgraphia, lower-­level transcription skills should be emphasized
to the point of becoming automatic. The connection between transcription skills and composition should be included in the instructional process; that is, children need to see how their work at letter
production is related to broader components of writing. Further,
because of WM constraints that frequently affect the instructional
process for students with learning disorders, all components of
writing should be taught within the same lesson. Building upon
Berninger’s sequencing of skills, Otaiba, Gillespie-­Rouse, and Baker
summarized features of effective handwriting instruction for kids
who struggle: direct instruction on letter formation that is modeled
and followed using verbal and visual instruction; retrieving letters
from memory using such strategies as a child viewing the letter,
covering, and reproducing the letter; children identifying their own
errors; newly learned letters are integrated into word and sentence
context and then into a child’s own writing product; integration of
multisensory strategies; and handwriting interventions included
practice, occurred regularly, and were relatively brief but meaningful (children learned that writing had a purpose beyond accurately
producing letters).
Explicit instruction of writing composition strategies combined
with implementation and coaching in self-­regulation will likely produce the greatest gains for students with writing deficits beyond

323

transcription. Emphasis will vary depending on the deficit specific
to the child. A well-­researched and well-­supported intervention for
poor writers is self-­regulated strategy development (SRSD). The
six stages in this model include developing and activating a child’s
background knowledge, introducing and discussing the strategy
that is being taught, modeling the strategy for the student, assisting
the child in memorization of the strategy, supporting the child’s use
of the strategy during implementation, and independent use of the
strategy. SRSD can be applied across various writing situations and
is supported until the student has developed mastery. The model
can emphasize the areas most needed by the child.
An additional excellent resource is entitled Teaching Elementary
School Students to Be Effective Writers and is found within the What
Works Clearinghouse maintained by the U.S. Department of Education’s Institute of Education Science.

Educational Resources

Children with identified learning disorders can potentially qualify for
formal education programming through special education or a Section 504 plan. Special education is guided on a federal level by the
Individual with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and includes
development of an individual education plan (IEP) (see Chapter 49).
The processes involved in pursuing an IEP are somewhat complex
and outlined in the chapter on math learning disability (MLD). A 504
plan provides accommodations to help children succeed in the regular
classroom. Accommodations that might be provided to a child with
IWE, through an IEP or a 504 plan, include dictation to a scribe when
confronted with lengthy writing tasks; additional time to complete
exams that require writing; and use of technology such as keyboarding, speech-­to-­text software, and writing devices that record teacher
instruction.
Speech-­
to-­
text capability is available on most smartphones,
which can be helpful for students from a functional standpoint.
Educational resources that can be accessed inside and outside the
classroom are often readily available for all children but may need
to be included as an accommodation for a child with dysgraphia.
Examples of easily available software include Voice Dictation in
Google Docs and Dictation in Microsoft Word, both available at
no cost. More sophisticated apps that can be purchased include
Co:Writer for Chrome, Read & Write, and Kurzweil 3000. Kurzweil
3000 is a comprehensive assistive technology device that, in addition to speech-­to-­text and text-­to-­speech, offers multiple valuable
resources for students with any type of literacy-­based learning disability. Editing is a critical component of the writing process and,
for children struggling with written expression, can present quite a
challenge. Microsoft Word has built-­in spelling and grammar correction suggestions, as do other word processing programs such as
Pages and Google Docs. Apps for use when using the internet are
also available to help with spelling, grammar, and writing mechanics. One example—though there are others—is Grammarly. When
recommending that parents pursue assistive technology for their
child as a potential accommodation, the physician should emphasize the importance of instruction to mastery of the device being
used. Learning to use technology effectively requires considerable
time and is initially likely to require additional effort, which can
result in frustration and avoidance.

324 Part IV u Learning and Developmental Disorders

Chapter 53

Language Development
and Communication
Disorders
Janet Y. Bang and Heidi M. Feldman
There are over 6,000 languages in the world, each with a distinct set of
symbols, defined as words or signs that signify objects, actions, ideas,
or relationships. By combining symbols in novel ways, humans can
create an infinite number of meanings. Human communication (Table
53.1) encompasses language, speech, nonverbal gestures, and written
language. Typically developing children learn language skills seemingly
without effort or explicit education early in the course of development.
However, there is wide variation in how and when children learn and
use language, speech, and communication. Globally, families differ in
the specific languages and number of languages they speak and in the
ways in which they communicate to convey their beliefs, values, and
circumstances. Children vary in their rates of learning language and
the highest level of skills they attain. Milestones within each domain
(language, speech, communication) signify the unfolding steps by
which new structures and skills come into children’s language abilities (Table 53.2 and Fig. 53.1). Some children require explicit education or clinical support to learn language or to make their speech easily
interpretable.

TYPICAL DEVELOPMENT
Development of Phonology

Every language is made up of an inventory of speech sounds or phonemes (see Table 53.1), and the number of speech sounds varies across
languages (e.g., Hawaiian = 13, Cantonese = more than 36, English =
46). Speech perception depends on the physical structures of the ear
and the auditory processing system. Fetuses detect sound as early as 28
weeks’ gestation, and within 5 days after birth, infants can demonstrate
the ability to discriminate vowel sounds (i.e., English vs Swedish) and
show preferences for their own prenatal monolingual or bilingual language environments (i.e., English vs Tagalog-­English). Infants develop
their speech sound perception, built on the ability to track the statistical probabilities of sound combinations (e.g., b + a is more prevalent
in language than b + d), segment sounds and words from a stream of
speech, and become attuned to the speech sounds in their respective
language or languages. Older children or adults learning a new language need to learn a new speech sound inventory.
Speech production involves activating the physical structures of
the respiratory tract and oral cavity, such as the lips, tongue, and vocal
cords, all of which work in concert. Infants begin producing nonspeech
cooing sounds at 4-­6 weeks. By 6-­8 months, many infants engage in
canonical babbling (e.g., bababa) followed by variegated babbling (e.g.,
badadeda). Infants who are exposed to sign language from birth demonstrate manual babbles at around the same time as hearing infants
begin vocal babbles. These skills lay the stage for infants’ first words
and subsequent word combinations. Speech production continues to
develop throughout early childhood, with easier consonant sounds
maturing early, around age 3 (e.g., in English p, b, m, h, w) and difficult sounds (e.g., in English l, s, r, v, ch, th) maturing late, typically by
around age 7.

Development of the Lexicon, Morphology, and
Syntax

It is difficult to pinpoint when in development children typically
understand their first word, but many children may say their first
words by around 1 year; English-­speaking families in the United States

report first words appearing as young as 7 and as late as 15 months.
Children’s first words mark their expressive skills in their lexicon (see
Table 53.1), and first words may come from a variety of categories (e.g.,
people, objects, and greetings). Many children recognize their own
name between 7 and 15 months old. Initial word learning is typically
very slow, but the rate of acquisition of new words gradually accelerates. Expressive lexical errors are common at this age and can include
overextensions (e.g., all edible objects are “apples”) or underextensions
(e.g., only one specific spoon is labeled “spoon”). Between 1 and 2
years, children build a lexicon of over 50 words. The vocabulary spurt
is rapid acceleration in word learning, usually after children reach 50
words in expressive language and coincident with the beginning of
two-­word phrases.
By approximately 2 years, children begin to demonstrate their developing understanding of morphology and syntax (see Table 53.1).
Morphology and syntax rules differ by language. Children’s receptive
syntax skills are evident when they can follow simple directions or
answer wh-­questions. Notable expressive morphologic milestones in
English include the use of the present progressive tense (e.g., “go-­ing”)
and the plural -­s (e.g., dog-­s). Expressive syntax skills are evident via
children’s early creative word combinations, starting with two-­word
combinations, which are likely to vary from adult models (e.g., in English “me down!” or “ick eggs!”). By 3 years, children begin to produce
sentences as long as five words and with increasingly complex grammar, such as negation (e.g., in English “I no want to”) and questions
(e.g., “What he do?”). As in these examples, lexical, morphologic, and/
or syntax errors in understanding and production are common during this early phase of syntactic development. Morphologic or syntax
errors in production may consist of overgeneralizations (e.g., in English, generalizing the “-­ed” ending to all verbs such as “runned” rather
than “ran”; in Spanish, Italian, or French, using the masculine articles
with feminine nouns). By 4-­5 years, children are able to use sentences
with adult-­like grammar (e.g., in English “I fell because I was running
too fast.”), although they may still make mistakes (e.g., in English “I gots
1 game and he got 3 games.”). Children also engage in longer, coherent,
connected discourse, such as telling or retelling stories and recounting
the steps of a familiar activity, such as taking a bath.

Development of Pragmatics

Pragmatic skills begin in infancy. The ability to attend to and follow
another’s eye gaze develops as early as 3-­4 months old. As young as 3
months old, children can engage in protoconversations, turn-­taking
patterns with caregivers that resemble early conversations. Responsive, contingent interactions between caregivers and children provide
infants the opportunity to experience, imitate, and practice the timing,
rhythm, and rate of nonverbal pragmatic skills, such as facial expressions, body language, and intonation. By 6 months, many infants can
passively follow the adult’s line of visual regard, resulting in a joint reference to the same objects and events in the environment. The ability
to share the same experience is critical to the development of further
language, social, and cognitive skills as infants “map” specific meanings
onto their experiences. By 10-­13 months, many infants can actively
show, give, and point to objects. Children vary widely in when these
skills first appear; English-­speaking families have reported pointing
skills as early as 6 months and as late as 16 months.
An important facet of typical communication development and a
building block of conversational turn-­taking skills includes establishing a joint focus of attention, a sharing of the topic of conversation
with a communicative partner, both in comprehension (e.g., infants
turn their heads to the object an adult is pointing at) and in production
(e.g., a child saying “look at that dog over there,” then looking back at
their caregiver and expressing a desire for a dog). Conversation skills
are important for forming relationships and especially strong social
bonds and friendships. As children reach school age and adolescence,
they develop nonliteral or figurative language skills (see Table 53.1),
including hints, idioms, metaphors, hyperbole, humor, and sarcasm.
In lexical development, understanding often occurs before production;
in children’s humor development, children’s production may precede
full understanding of their meaning. Another notable milestone of

pragmatic skills is the ability to adapt how to narrate events or stories
for different audiences (e.g., friends vs teachers).

Advanced Language Skills

Once children enter school, they continue to develop new vocabulary
and use increasingly complex sentence constructions to communicate
about abstract, hypothetical, and imaginary topics. By adolescence,
many students in Westernized school systems are required to deliver

expository speeches or to debate. Formal schooling also affords new
situations to communicate with a broader network of individuals,
including teachers, coaches, and supervisors. The diversity of the situations requires nuanced attention to social rules and conventions and
increases exposure to diverse forms of nonliteral language use, though
proficiency in the use of nonliteral language varies by the language
and culture of the speaker and addressee. Finally, the introduction
of formal schooling presents children with the demands of acquiring

Fig. 53.1 Timeline of children’s early language, speech, and communication skills and caregivers’ and educators’ strategies to support that devel-

opment. The timing and width of boxes for the child skills are adapted from milestones from the American Speech-­Language-­Hearing Association,
The American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More information on milestones can also be seen in Table
53.1. Caregivers and educators should be encouraged to engage with the child using the language with which they are most comfortable because
children, even children with delays, are capable of becoming bilingual. Specific child skills and caregiver/educator strategies may vary according to
language and cultural practices.

literacy skills (see Table 53.1), those skills required for reading and
writing. Early oral language skills are a robust predictor of children’s
early reading skills, and early oral language and reading skills are in
turn predictors of children’s writing skills (see Chapters 51 and 52.2).
Language skills become critical to support high-­level school-­and
work-­related literacy skills.

BILINGUALISM AND MULTILINGUALISM

Worldwide, learning more than one language is more common than
learning just one; many regions and countries in the world are home
to individuals who routinely speak two or more languages. The timing of exposure, balance between languages, and level of skill in each
language in dual-­language or multilanguage learners varies across situations. Simultaneous bilinguals refers to those regularly exposed to
both languages prenatally or from birth. Sequential bilinguals refers
to those exposed to the second language after the first language, often
when they enter school, though the timing of when the second language is introduced varies. Once children learn two languages, the
balance in skill level between them may vary. For example, a child
who was born in Nigeria, exposed to Igbo, and then immigrated to
Greece at age 5 years will initially be more proficient in Igbo than in
Greek. As the child attends school in Greece, Greek proficiency will
improve (likely also supported through the introduction of reading
and writing in a Greek monolingual school environment), and thus
the balance will shift and the child may become more proficient in
Greek over Igbo. A high level of skill across all domains of phonology, lexicon, syntax, and pragmatics is considered an ideal picture
of bilingualism, but this ideal is not always the case or necessary
for many bilingual learners. Bilingual learners often demonstrate

code-­switching, that is, alternating between languages, or code-­
mixing, mixing their languages together, especially when speaking
with other bilingual speakers. A distinction between conversational
and academic language skills may be made in reference to bilinguals.
Bilingual speakers may master conversational language, the language
used to communicate casually with family or friends, but remain less
skilled in academic language, the complex, technical, and specialized vocabulary and syntax required in academic or work settings,
particularly when school is presented in a language different from
the language of the home. Some bilingual learners may experience
language attrition, a reduction in the proficiency in one language
over time. Factors within the child, family (e.g., one caregiver/one
language, caregivers speaking both languages), community (e.g.,
availability of bilingual schooling, minority vs majority language of
the community, perceived prestige of a language), and policy (e.g.,
national acknowledgement of multiple languages or requirements of
accessibility of documents in school or business sectors) contribute
to proficiency in both languages.
Bilingualism or multilingualism is typical language development for
many children and not an adequate explanation for language delays as
long as the child’s skills in both languages are assessed. Even children
with language and developmental disorders, such as intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder, may be successful bilingual or
multilanguage learners. It is difficult to predict developmental trajectories in bilingual development because of the wide variety of factors
associated with the level of skill in different domains. Children in homes
with two or more languages who show delays in language development
(considering the accumulated accomplishments in all languages) should
be promptly referred for evaluation.

328 Part IV u Learning and Developmental Disorders
DRIVERS OF VARIATION IN TYPICAL LANGUAGE
DEVELOPMENT
Genetic

Similarities in language abilities across members of the same family
suggest that genetic factors contribute to individual differences in language abilities. Genetic factors have been studied more often in the
context of disorders of language learning than in the context of normal
variation (see below).

Environment

skills than watchful waiting. Biologic sex differences have been found
in many studies of language development. Though males are generally
slower to develop than females, the differences do not usually rise to
the level of being clinically apparent. However, males are more likely
to develop language disorders than females. Based on these findings,
children with moderate to severe delays in the development of language
and speech deserve a prompt evaluation, even if they are males, non–first
born children, twins, tongue-­tied toddlers, and/or children with chronic
otitis media.

Interactions between young children and their caregivers that are positive, responsive, and warm allow children to practice their early word
learning (e.g., social games, routines). Living in stable home environments is better for language development than living in an unstable
condition. The Bucharest Early Intervention Project conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine the role of being raised in a home
(foster care) versus in institutionalized care in Romanian orphanages
that were providing infants with low levels of responsive interactions.
Children taken from the orphanages and placed in foster care by age
15 months had language skills that were similar to typically developing peers at 30 and 42 months in the same Romanian community living with their biologic families; children placed in foster care after 24
months had persistent expressive language delays.
The role of caregivers specifically is one of the few levers available
to influence language outcomes in clinical practice and public programs. Positive links have been found between variability in socioeconomic backgrounds and children’s later language skills; caregivers have
been shown to mediate this link. Caregivers’ child-­directed speech
refers to changes to caregivers’ prosody (intonation patterns), phonology, grammar, and lexicon when engaging with young children.
This child-­directed speech has been measured across a wide variety of
features, which can be broadly categorized into measures of quantity
(e.g., total number of words spoken), quality (e.g., number of different words spoken), and interaction (e.g., warmth and responsiveness).
Taken together, these factors constitute language nutrition, which,
like dietary nutrition, is associated with rates of growth. However, the
causal links between caregivers’ child-­directed speech and children’s
language outcomes are still unclear in children with typical development or language delays or disorders. Meta-­analyses of interventions
targeting improved language nutrition to date have generally reported
either null effects or small to moderate positive effects on children’s
language skills. The specific role of book-­sharing interventions to support children’s language development is also mixed among different
meta-­analyses. Wide heterogeneity across intervention studies, including the method of delivery (e.g., one-­on-­one coaching vs caregiver
groups), intensity (e.g., 1 hour per week for 12 weeks vs two 45-­minute
visits), measures of caregiver-­child interaction, and child language
outcomes, may contribute to differences in results. Caregivers’ mental
health has been found to be an important mediator of child outcomes;
higher caregiver depression has been linked to poorer children’s language outcomes.
Greater amounts of screen time and early age of screen time are
negatively related to children’s early language skills. However, high-­
quality screen-­time practices (e.g., co-­viewing, educational programs)
are positively related to children’s language skills; effect sizes are small
to moderate.

LANGUAGE, SPEECH, AND COMMUNICATION
DISORDERS

Misattributions of Language Delay

Genetic factors appear to play a major role in influencing how children
learn to talk. A family history may identify current or past speech or
language problems in up to 30% of first-­degree relatives of proband
children. Concordance rate for low language test scores and/or a history of speech therapy within twin pairs is about 50% in dizygotic
pairs and 90% in monozygotic pairs. Consistent pathogenic genetic
variations have not been identified. Instead, multiple genetic regions
and epigenetic changes may result in heterogeneous genetic pathways
causing language disorders. Several single-­nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) involving noncoding regulatory genes, including CNTNAP2
(contactin-­associated-­protein-­like-­2) and KIAA0319, are strongly
associated with early language acquisition and are also thought to

Several common conditions have been erroneously implicated as an
adequate explanation for language delays and disorders. Typically
developing twins learn to talk at the same age as typically developing
single-­born children. Birth-­order effects on language development
have not been consistently found. Ankyloglossia (tongue-­
tie), an
extremely tight lingual frenulum, does not prevent the acquisition of
speech, but ankyloglossia may be the result of abnormalities associated with disorders of speech, such as neural injury and cerebral palsy.
Frequent ear infections and serous otitis media in early childhood do
not result in persisting language disorder. Prompt placement of tympanostomy tubes for chronic serous otitis media does not lead to better

Impairment in language, speech, and communication may occur in
isolation or may be associated with other conditions.

Isolated Language Disorders with or Without
Accompanying Speech Disorders
Clinical Presentation

Primary disorders of speech and language development are significant
difficulties found in the absence of major cognitive, sensory, or motor
dysfunction. The literature uses the term specific language impairment (SLI) or language impairment, the term we use here, also called
developmental language disorder or developmental dysphasia. Children with language impairment typically perform >1.25-­1.5 standard
deviations below the mean on standardized language assessments. The
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition
(DSM-­5) criteria for a language disorder are provided in Table 53.3.
Many children with language impairment eventually become competent language users, though they may show persistent and subtle
difficulties with skills related to phonology, lexicon, and/or syntax.
As adolescents and adults, compared to peers, they are generally less
proficient at producing stories, descriptions, and scripts of everyday
events, collectively known as oral narratives. Their narratives tend to
be shorter, including fewer prepositions, main story ideas, and devices
fostering cohesion. Children with language impairment may have
significant difficulty in higher-­level language skills (see Table 53.1),
reasoning skills (e.g., drawing correct inferences and conclusions),
the ability to take another person’s perspective, and the ability to paraphrase and rephrase. Some children with language impairment show
difficulties with social interaction because social interactions are often
mediated by verbal language. Young children with language impairment may interact more successfully with older children or adults, who
can adapt their communication to match the child’s level of function,
than with peers.

Epidemiology

Over 15% of 2-­year-­olds may not produce a vocabulary of 50 words or
two-­word utterances; estimates may vary for children exposed to two
or more languages. Almost half of preschool-­age children, age 3-­5 years
old, who qualify for special education meet eligibility based only on
speech-­language impairment. By age 5, approximately 6% of children
are identified as having a speech impairment alone, 5% as having both
speech and language impairment, and 8% as having language impairment alone. Males are nearly twice as likely to have an identified speech
or language impairment as females.

Chapter 53 u Language Development and Communication Disorders
affect early neuronal structural development. Several chromosomal
copy number variants (see Chapter 96) have also been associated with
abnormalities of language and speech; these variants may be associated with distinctive physical features (e.g., tall stature in Klinefelter
syndrome) or neurobehavioral conditions (e.g., autistic features).
Environmental, hormonal, and nutritional factors may exert epigenetic influences by dysregulating gene expression. These forces result
in aberrant sequencing of the onset, growth, and timing of language
development.
All of the family, community, and sociopolitical factors that appear
to contribute to variation in typical language learning may contribute
to the rate of learning in children with disorders. Improving the quality
of the verbal environment, and in particular the quantity and quality of
child-­directed speech (see above), may moderate the impact of genetic
and epigenetic factors.

Pathogenesis

Language functioning is widely distributed across the brain through
interconnected neural networks. Frank neurologic injury is typically
absent in children with language impairment. Language disorders have
been attributed to a fundamental difficulty in the brain’s capacity to
process complex information rapidly. Limitations in the amount of
information that can be stored in verbal working memory (see Chapter
49) may also limit the rate at which language information is processed.
Electrophysiologic studies show abnormal latency in the early phase of
auditory processing in children with language impairment. Neuroimaging studies identify an array of anatomic abnormalities, implicated
in language processing. MRI scans in children with language impairment may reveal white matter lesions and volume loss, ventricular
enlargement, focal gray matter heterotopia within the right and left
parietotemporal white matter, abnormal morphology of the inferior
frontal gyrus, atypical patterns of asymmetry of language cortex, or
increased thickness of the corpus callosum in a minority of affected
children. Postmortem studies of children with language disorders
found evidence of atypical symmetry in the plana temporale and cortical dysplasia in the region of the sylvian fissure. A high rate of atypical
perisylvian asymmetries has been documented in the parents of children with language impairment.

Language Disorders Associated with Cognitive
Impairment and Intellectual Disability

Speech and language impairment may be the first indication of a
global neurodevelopmental disorder. Global developmental delay or
early developmental impairment is defined as delays in two or more
domains. Children with substantial delays in adaptive function and
scores 2 or more standard deviations below the mean on intelligence
testing may meet criteria for intellectual disability (see Chapter 56).
Most children with a mild intellectual disability learn to communicate adequately, though they are likely to encounter difficulties with
higher-­level language skills (see Table 53.1). Children with an IQ as
low as 25 may eventually acquire a small lexicon and ability to combine
words. Specific genetic syndromes have distinctive language profiles:
in Down syndrome, verbal skills are more impaired than nonverbal
skills; in William syndrome, language skills may be relatively preserved
compared to nonverbal skills; in fragile X syndrome, unusual word or
sound repetition may be present.

Autism Spectrum Disorder

A disordered pattern of language, speech, and communication development characterizes autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (see Chapter
58). The core characteristics of ASD are persistent difficulties in social
communication and social interaction relative to age expectations and
restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. Children with ASD show a wide range of language and communication
abilities. At the severe end, language and speech may be extremely
limited (nonverbal). Approximately 30–50% of children with ASD also
meet criteria for intellectual disability, which contributes to the challenges of developing communication skills. Parents report regression

329

in language and social skills (autistic regression) in approximately
20–25% of children with ASD, usually between 12 and 36 months of
age. The cause of the regression is not known; it is associated with an
increased risk for intellectual disability and severe ASD. Individuals with ASD who are high functioning may have large vocabularies
and use grammatically correct sentences but have unusual or impaired
social-­pragmatic features, such as odd intonation patterns, off-­topic
comments, and atypical conversational skills. For example, they may
engage in long monologues about a topic of special interest, without
considering the interest of their conversational partner. Some individuals with ASD have highly specialized, isolated, “savant” skills, such as
calendar calculations or hyperlexia (the precocious ability to recognize written words beyond expectation based on general intellectual
ability).
DSM-­5 identified social (pragmatic) communication disorder
(SPCD) as a category of communication disorder distinct from ASD
(see Table 53.3). Symptoms of SPCD include extreme literalness and
inappropriate verbal and social interactions. Socially appropriate use
and understanding of figurative language (see Table 53.1) depends on
correct interpretation of the meaning and the context of language and
the ability to draw proper inferences, skills limited in SPCD. SPCD has
been recognized as a symptom of a wide range of disorders, including
right-­hemisphere brain injury and nonverbal learning disabilities.

Hearing Impairment

Hearing loss may be caused by a sensorineural loss, a conductive loss,
or a mixed picture in one or both ears. Although it is not possible to
accurately predict the impact of hearing loss on a child’s verbal language development, the type, degree, and laterality of hearing loss;
the age of onset; and the duration of the auditory impairment before
amplification play important roles (see Chapter 55). Newborn screening programs are designed to identify congenital hearing loss but fail to
identify children with progressive or acquired hearing loss or deafness
after birth. Any child who shows a speech or language problem should
have a hearing assessment by an audiologist, even if they passed their
newborn hearing screen.
Conductive hearing loss occurs when sounds cannot get through
the outer and middle ear to stimulate the auditory nerve. In children,
the most common cause of conductive hearing loss is acute or chronic
serous otitis media. Otitis media is typically transient and may increase
the sound threshold at which children can detect tones or understand
language. Persistent fluid in the middle ear may be treated with tympanostomy or ventilation tubes. However, treatment of chronic serous
otitis media with tympanostomy tubes does not improve outcomes in
the domains of speech and language, cognition, academic skills, or psychosocial functioning from preschool years through middle childhood.

Neurologic Conditions
Epilepsy Syndromes

Children with Landau-­Kleffner syndrome or verbal auditory agnosia
have a history of typical language development until they experience
a regression in their ability to comprehend spoken language—verbal
auditory agnosia—along with the development of seizures, usually
between 3 and 7 years of age. Expressive language skills also typically
deteriorate. An electroencephalogram (EEG) may show a distinct pattern of status epilepticus in sleep (continuous spike wave in slow-­wave
sleep), and up to 80% of children with Landau-­Kleffner syndrome
eventually exhibit clinical seizures. Use of antiepileptic medication,
corticosteroids, and intravenous gamma globulin has led to varying
results. The prognosis for return of typical language ability is uncertain,
even if seizures resolve.
Epileptic interictal discharges are more frequently found on EEGs of
children with language impairments than EEGs of otherwise typically
developing children. The discharges are likely a manifestation of an
underlying disorder of brain, distinct from the language impairment.
Only when seizure symptoms or regression in language ability is present is a routine EEG recommended in the evaluation for a child with
speech and/or language impairment.

2.	Impairment of the ability to change communication to match
context or the needs of the listener, such as speaking differently
in a classroom than on a playground, talking differently to
a child than to an adult, and avoiding use of overly formal
language.
3.	Difficulties following rules for conversation and storytelling,
such as taking turns in conversation, rephrasing when
misunderstood, and knowing how to use verbal and
nonverbal signals to regulate interaction.
4.	Difficulties understanding what is not explicitly stated (e.g.,
making inferences) and nonliteral or ambiguous meanings of
language (e.g., idioms, humor, metaphors, multiple meanings
that depend on the context for interpretation).
B.	The deficits result in functional limitations in effective communication,
social participation, social relationships, academic achievement, or
occupational performance, individually or in combination.
C.	The onset of the symptoms is in the early developmental
period (but deficits may not become fully manifest until social
communication demands exceed limited capacities).
D.	The symptoms are not attributable to another medical or neurologic
condition or to low abilities in the domains of word structure and
grammar and are not better explained by autism spectrum disorder,
intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder), global
developmental delay, or another mental disorder.

Cerebellar Mutism Syndrome

In the aftermath of operations for tumors in the posterior fossa, such as
medulloblastoma, many children lose the ability to speak. Fortunately,
though the presentation is initially profound, most children recover the
ability to use language. Cerebellar mutism syndrome demonstrates
that the cerebellum probably plays a fundamental role in language and
communication. The syndrome is thought to result from damage to the
superior cerebellar peduncle that connects the cerebellum to language
centers in the frontal lobes.

Stroke

Strokes in childhood can occur prenatally, in the perinatal period, or at
any time in childhood. As in adults, a brain territory frequently affected
is supplied by the middle cerebral artery resulting in damage to the left
frontal and temporal lobes that are associated with language function
in adults. However, young children with stroke show greater plasticity
of language function than do adults with similar brain injuries. Many
children with left hemisphere stroke go on to demonstrate typical or
near-­typical language functions. Functional imaging studies document
that these children activate uninjured regions of the left hemisphere
around the stroke or homologous regions in the right hemisphere.
This demonstrates that though under usual circumstances the left
hemisphere serves language, alternative networks can substitute in the
case of early injury. The quality of the home language environment is
strongly associated with the language skills of children with strokes.

Metabolic and Neurodegenerative Disorders (see
Part IX and Chapter 639)

Regression of language development may accompany loss of neuromotor function at the outset of a number of metabolic diseases, including lysosomal storage disorders (metachromatic leukodystrophy),

peroxisomal disorders (adrenal leukodystrophy), ceroid lipofuscinosis (Batten disease), and mucopolysaccharidosis (Hunter disease,
Hurler disease). A creatine transporter deficiency was identified as an
X-­linked disorder that manifests with language delay in males and with
mild learning disability in female carriers.

Hydrocephalus (see Chapter 631.11)

Children with hydrocephalus may be described as having cocktail-­
party syndrome. In this syndrome, children may use sophisticated
words, but their comprehension of abstract concepts is limited, pragmatic conversational skills are weak, their analyses are superficial, and/
or they appear to be carrying on a monologue.

Language in the Context of Psychologic or Mental
Health Conditions
Selective Mutism

In selective mutism, children do not speak in specific social situations,
such as school or other settings outside the home, though they speak
normally in certain settings, such as within their home or when they
are alone with their parents. Other symptoms include excessive shyness, withdrawal, dependency on parents, and oppositional behavior.
Most cases of selective mutism are the manifestation of a chronic pattern of anxiety. Children with selective mutism often report that they
want to speak in social settings but are too afraid, worried, or distressed
to do so. The family history is often positive for anxiety symptoms.
Children with selective mutism may also have a language or speech
impairment, contributing to their sense of distress in speaking. Treatment of selective mutism generally uses evidence-­based approaches to
reducing general anxiety, including cognitive-­behavioral therapy and/
or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in conjunction with speech-­
language therapy.

Chapter 53 u Language Development and Communication Disorders

331

Schizophrenia

cleft palate need long-­term therapy with a speech-­language pathologist (SLP). Cleft palate may occur in isolation, called nonsyndromic
cleft palate, or in conjunction with other malformations, called syndromic cleft palate. Velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS) is an autosomal dominant condition that results from a deletion on the long arm
of chromosome 22 (deletion22q11) and may include cleft palate. Many
different phenotypes are associated with this deletion, demonstrating
the complex relationship of genes, anatomic structure, and function.
The prognosis for speech and language in such cases is dependent on
the specific syndrome associated with the cleft palate.

Adverse Psychosocial Conditions
Orphanages

Velopharyngeal Insufficiency

A characteristic of schizophrenia is abnormal communication, including highly disorganized language that is difficult to follow and frequent
changes in topic (see Chapter 47.1). This communication challenge
accompanies the thought disturbance that is the hallmark of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia usually presents in individuals in adolescence
or young adulthood. The communication disorder is linked to other
features of schizophrenia, including slower processing speed, poorer
cognitive control, and weaker working memory relative to typically
developing peers.

An estimated 8 million children worldwide are living in residential
care or orphanages, despite recognition of the severe adverse impacts
of institutionalization on children’s health and development. Children
in orphanages have poor receptive and expressive language skills, most
likely the result of limited language exposure and lack of consistent
warm relationships with caring adults. Children from orphanages may
be adopted. In an international adoption, the children typically face a
new challenge: learning a different language (see Chapter 9). Outcomes
for internationally adopted children are mixed; meta-­analyses suggest
trends for stronger language outcomes when children are adopted
before the age of 1 year than after 1 year. However, findings were not
statistically significant, likely because of the wide variety of challenges
that the children face and difficulty identifying appropriate comparison
groups.

Foster Care

Approximately 30–75% of the children 6 years of age or younger in
foster care are delayed, and therefore assessing language skills for
them is imperative (see Chapter 10). An important contribution to
the language delay in many children in foster care, like that of children
in orphanages, is the lack of consistently warm, responsive parenting
that is fundamental to language nutrition. Encouraging foster parents
to increase language nutrition may positively affect the language skills
of children in foster care.

High-­Stress, Low-­Verbal Environments

Children from homes where they may experience stressors, such as
food insecurity, housing insecurity, poor childcare facilities, and high
levels of community violence, are at risk for slower language development relative to peers in stable environments. All of these factors may
contribute to initial delays in physical and cognitive development,
with language development being one of the most noticeable to track
developmental progress. If language delays persist, the chances that the
children will catch up with others from more resourced environments,
even if their circumstance change, are limited. Thus, what begins as
a delay may end up as a disorder. Referral of children from stressed,
low-­verbal environments to public and community-­based prevention
programs designed to provide stability and to enhance language input
may improve the children’s outcomes.

SPEECH DISORDERS
Structural Anomalies of the Organs of Speech
Cleft Lip and Palate

Cleft lip is a split in the formation of the lip. Cleft palate is a split in the
hard and/or soft palate (see Chapter 356). These conditions often occur
together but may occur separately. Cleft lip or palate is the most common structural abnormality at birth in the United States. The cleft is
often easy to see but may be subtle if isolated to the soft palate. A child
with isolated cleft lip may have minimal speech problems. A child with
cleft palate is likely to have speech difficulties, including hypernasal
speech in which air escapes through the nose, making it difficult to
produce consonants that need pressure to build in the mouth for proper
execution (e.g., b, k, and s). In addition, children with cleft palate may
have severe and persistent serous otitis media, leading to moderate to
severe conductive hearing loss beyond the frequency and complications of children with an intact palate. Therefore most children with

Velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) is an abnormality of the soft palate, such that the soft palate cannot regulate the flow of air between
the mouth and nose in speech. It may occur as part of cleft palate or
may be an isolated finding. VPI may not be apparent in early development when the adenoids are large and bolster the soft palate. As the
adenoids regress, it may become clear that the soft palate is not closing off the passage to the nose, creating hypernasal speech. Evaluation
of the intactness of the soft palate is important before adenoidectomy
because removal of the adenoids can bring on VPI suddenly. Surgery or
use of prosthetic devices may be required for individuals who cannot
be helped by speech therapy.

Speech Sound Disorders

Speech sound disorders is an umbrella term that refers to difficulties
with perception, motor production, or phonologic representation of
speech sounds and/or speech segments (see Table 53.3). Speech sound
disorders may be organic in origin, including neurologic conditions,
structural conditions, or sensory conditions. Speech sound disorders
are considered functional when no known cause can be identified.
Speech sound disorders may be accompanied by subtle difficulties in
speech perception.

Phonologic Disorders

Phonologic disorders are functional speech sound disorders that affect
linguistic aspects of speech. Phonologic processes (see Table 53.1) are
errors in speech production based on violations of predictable, rule-­
based features of speech. These phonologic processes are typical at
young ages and resolve at specific ages. Phonologic processes become
disorders when they persist to older ages and impair intelligibility.

Articulation Disorders

Articulation disorders focus on errors (such as distortions and substitutions) in production of individual speech sounds regardless of
where in a word or phrase the sound occurs. Articulation errors are
not the result of neuromotor impairment, but rather seem to reflect an
inability to correctly process the words they hear. As a result, they lack
understanding of how to fit sounds together properly to create words.
Children with articulation or other speech sound disorders are at risk
for later reading and learning disability.

Childhood Apraxia of Speech

In childhood apraxia of speech (CAS), difficulty in planning and coordinating movements for speech sound production results in inconsistent distortions or errors of speech sounds, even vowel sounds. The
same word may be pronounced differently each time, making intelligibility poor. Intelligibility also tends to decline as the length and
complexity of the child’s speech increase. Consonants may be deleted
and sounds transposed. As they try to talk spontaneously or imitate
others’ speech, children with CAS may display oral groping or struggling. Children with CAS frequently have a history of early feeding
difficulty, limited sound production as infants, and/or delayed onset
of spoken words. They may point, grunt, or develop an elaborate gestural communication system in an attempt to overcome their verbal
difficulty. Apraxia may be limited to verbal motor skills, may extend
to oral-­motor function, or may be a more generalized problem affecting fine and/or gross motor coordination. Childhood apraxia of speech
may co-­occur with disorders of language and learning.

332 Part IV u Learning and Developmental Disorders
Dysarthria

This motor speech disorder often originates from neuromotor disorders, such as cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, myopathy, and facial
palsy. Dysarthria is characterized by lack of strength and muscular control and manifests as slurring of words and distorting vowels.
Speech patterns are often slow and labored. Feeding difficulty, drooling, open-­mouth posture, and protruding tongue may accompany the
dysarthric speech.

Disorders of Fluency, Voice, and Resonance
Stuttering

Under normal circumstances, most people do not speak smoothly all
the time, but rather repeat words or sounds, hesitate to find a word,
pause, add “uh” or “you know” to the flow of speech, or repeat a sound
or word more than once. These disruptions are called dysfluencies
and are discussed further in Chapter 53.1. Stuttering in children over
age 4 that lasts longer than 6 months, includes repetition of individual
sounds, and/or creates emotional distress should be evaluated by a
speech and language pathologist.

Voice

A voice disorder is an abnormality in voice quality, pitch, and loudness that is unexpected or inappropriate for an individual’s age, gender,
cultural background, or geographic location. Voice disorders can be
subdivided into organic and functional. Organic voice disorders are
physiologic in nature and result from alterations in respiratory, laryngeal, or vocal tract mechanisms. Aerodigestive disorders cover congenital or acquired conditions of the aerodigestive tract; they include
abnormalities of the airway (pharynx and larynx), pulmonary tract
(trachea, bronchi, and lungs), and upper digestive tract (esophagus).
These structural problems may affect respiratory and swallowing functions and speech, especially voice. Functional voice disorders result
from improper or inefficient use of the vocal mechanism in the context of normal physical structure. Psychologic stress can also lead to
habitual and maladaptive voice quality, known as psychogenic voice
disorders. These categories may overlap. Vocal nodules result from
behavioral voice misuse that leads to repeated trauma to the vocal folds
and structural changes to the vocal fold tissue.

ASSESSMENT OF LANGUAGE AND SPEECH
DISORDERS
Screening

Developmental surveillance at each well-­child visit should include specific questions about typical language developmental milestones and
observations of the child’s behavior. Clinical judgment, defined as eliciting and responding to parents’ concerns, can detect many children
with speech and language challenges. The American Academy of Pediatricians (AAP) recommends clinicians employ standardized developmental screening questionnaires and observation checklists at select
well-­child visits (see Chapter 28). However, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force reviewed screening for language impairment in young
children in primary care settings and found inadequate evidence to
support screening in the absence of parental or clinician concern about
children’s speech, language, hearing, or development. At present, when
parents, other caregivers, or physicians are concerned about speech or
language development, the child should be referred for a diagnostic
evaluation and intervention.

Diagnostic Evaluation

A developmental delay indicates abnormally slow timing relative
to same-­age peers in the development of the skill. A language delay
becomes a language disorder when it persists to school age; is functionally impactful in terms of communication, social skills, or learning and cognition; or is qualitatively different from normal patterns or
sequences of development. Language and communication skills should
be interpreted within the context of that child’s overall cognitive, social,
and physical abilities. A multidisciplinary evaluation of a child with
language delay or disorder is often warranted. At a minimum, the diagnostic evaluation should include psychologic or neurodevelopmental

evaluation, including an assessment of social skills, a speech-­language
evaluation, an audiologic assessment, and a pediatric examination.

Psychologic or Neurodevelopmental Evaluation

The two main goals for the psychologic evaluation of a young child
with a communication disorder are to assess nonverbal cognitive ability
and social skills. A broad-­based cognitive assessment is important to
determine the breadth and severity of developmental difficulties. At a
minimum, the child should have an assessment of both verbal and nonverbal skills. As children reach school age, they may be assessed with an
intelligence test and an assessment of adaptive function to determine if
they meet criteria for intellectual disability (see Chapter 56). If the child
has findings of global developmental delay or intellectually disability,
their language and speech skills should be evaluated within that context. Language and speech disorders may coexist with other conditions,
so that the psychologic evaluation at all ages should consider mental
health conditions, such as anxiety, mood disorder, and attention-­deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and, at older ages, learning challenges.
A child’s social behaviors must be assessed to determine whether the
child meets diagnostic criteria for ASD (see Chapter 58). Children with
language impairment may display an interest in social interaction, even
if they may have difficulty socializing because of limitations in communication skills, such as difficulties initiating conversation or taking
turns. Children with ASD do not display social interest in typical ways.
However, the distinction may be challenging in the context of a clinical evaluation when the child needs to interact only with professional
adults and not with peers. Observational tests include specific maneuvers, such as calling the child’s name, making exaggerated gestures, and
attempting to engage the child in a reciprocal interaction around blowing bubbles, to make this distinction.

Speech and Language Evaluation

A certified SLP should perform a speech and language evaluation on
a child with delays or difficulties in language and speech. A typical
evaluation includes assessment of language, speech, and the physical
mechanisms associated with speech production. Both expressive and
receptive language (see Table 53.1) are assessed, using a combination of
standardized measures, informal interactions, and pertinent observations. All components of language are assessed, including phonology,
lexicon, morphology, syntax, and pragmatics (see Table 53.1). Speech
assessment similarly uses a combination of standardized measures and
informal observations and includes assessment of speech sounds, fluency, voice, and resonance. Assessment of physical structures includes
oral structures and function, respiratory function, and vocal quality.

Audiologic Assessment (see Chapter 677)

In many settings, an SLP works in conjunction with an audiologist,
who can do an appropriate hearing evaluation of the child. If an audiologist is not available in that setting, a separate referral should be made.
No child is too young for a hearing evaluation. Passive methods can be
used in children who are young or unable to cooperate with testing.
Repeat assessment with an active assessment can be accomplished at
older ages. A referral for full hearing evaluation is appropriate whenever there is suspicion of language or speech impairment.

Pediatric Evaluation

History and physical examination should focus on the identification
of potential contributors to the child’s language and communication
difficulties. A family history of delay in talking, need for speech and
language therapy, or academic difficulty can suggest a genetic predisposition to language disorders. Pregnancy history might reveal risk
factors for prenatal developmental anomalies, such as polyhydramnios
or decreased fetal movement patterns. Small size for gestational age
at birth, symptoms of neonatal encephalopathy, or early and persistent oral-­motor feeding difficulty may presage speech and language
difficulty. Developmental history should focus on the age when various language skills were mastered and the sequences and patterns of
milestone acquisition. Regression or loss of acquired skills should raise
immediate concern.

Chapter 53 u Language Development and Communication Disorders
Physical examination should include measurement of height
(length), weight, and head circumference, even in children over age 2
years. The skin should be examined for lesions consistent with phakomatosis (see Chapter 636). Anomalies of the head and neck, such as white
forelock and hypertelorism (Waardenburg syndrome), ear malformations (Goldenhar syndrome), facial and cardiac anomalies (Williams
syndrome, VCFS), retrognathism of the chin (Pierre Robin anomaly),
or cleft lip/palate, are associated with hearing and speech abnormalities. Neurologic examination might reveal muscular hypertonia or
hypotonia, both of which can affect neuromuscular control of speech.
Generalized muscular hypotonia, with increased range of motion of
the joints, is frequently seen in children with language impairment.
The reason for this association is not clear, but it might account for the
fine and gross motor clumsiness often seen in these children. However, mild hypotonia is not a sufficient explanation for the impairment
of receptive and expressive language. Language impairment may be a
component of a syndrome or other recognizable condition. The physical examination gathers information to make other diagnoses.
No routine diagnostic studies are indicated for isolated language disorders with the exception of the hearing assessment. When language
delay is a part of a generalized cognitive or physical disorder, referral
for further genetic evaluation, genetic testing (e.g., fragile X testing,
microarray, whole exome or whole genome sequencing), neuroimaging studies, and EEG should be considered.

Treatment of Language and Speech Disorders

Disorders of language and speech are often treated by SLPs working
alone or as part of a multidisciplinary team with others, such as early
intervention specialists or occupational therapists. SLPs may work in
hospital in-­patient and out-­patient settings. More commonly, they
work in schools and early intervention programs. The nature and intensity of treatment are predicated on the nature and cause of the language
or speech disorder and the explicit objectives of treatment. Childhood
apraxia of speech typically requires that the child participate in four or
five short sessions per week to achieve intelligible speech, whereas language impairment disorder may require once-­or twice-­weekly therapy
in a peer-­group setting to increase communicative attempts. Speech-­
language therapy for young children is typically play-­based. Even drills
are couched in naturally occurring, enjoyable, or fun activities. Group
therapy with other young children is often well suited to children with
language and communication disorders because children practice their
emerging skills with peers in naturalistic settings. A strong family component to therapy is important to leverage the limited time that therapists can spend with children. Caregivers can be taught to use effective
techniques designed to meet the objectives of the treatment program.
For children who do not develop useful verbal language, the SLP may
consider the use of assistive and augmentative communication (AAC;
see Chapter 54), which may use high-­technology devices, such as
voice-­generating computer programs, or low-­
technology solutions,
such as sign language or picture exchanges. The use of AAC allows the
nonverbal child to communicate within the human community. Several systematic reviews and meta-­analyses provide compelling data
that speech-­language therapy is effective for improving many aspects
of language and speech. Therefore a timely referral for treatment with
an SLP is recommended over watchful waiting for many children with
delays and disorders of language and speech.

53.1 Childhood-­Onset Fluency Disorder
Kenneth L. Grizzle and Karolyn Mirasola
Dysfluent speech describes speech, language, and voice behaviors that
interrupt the production and fluency of sounds, words, and thoughts.
All speakers produce dysfluent speech, but not all dysfluent speech is
stuttering. The words stuttering, stammering, and dysfluency are often
used interchangeably. Stutter is used informally, particularly in the

333

United States, to describe when an individual is struggling to express
themself and may speak in a halting manner. Stammering is used in
the United Kingdom in place of stuttering (Table 53.4). It is important
for clinicians to have a general understanding about what stuttering is
and when to counsel and refer families to speech-­language pathologists
(SLPs). It is important to distinguish between stuttered and nonstuttered dysfluencies and other fluency disorders and to identify concomitant symptoms.

DIAGNOSIS

In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-­5), the term stuttering has been removed from the diagnostic classification, and the disorder is referred to as childhood-­onset
fluency disorder (Table 53.5). Note that impact on functional behavior is a component of the psychiatric diagnosis. In contrast, communication disorder specialists would consider anxiety and avoidance
of various activities as concomitant symptoms, but not necessarily a
requirement for the diagnosis of stuttering.
Child-­onset stuttering (formerly known as developmental stuttering) is a speech disorder that often begins in the preschool period

334 Part IV u Learning and Developmental Disorders
and is not associated with stroke, traumatic brain injury, or other possible medical conditions. Stuttering behaviors can occur in typically
developing children who do not have a speech disorder and in this
situation are more accurately referred to as developmental dysfluencies.
During the toddler and preschool years, children often produce repetition of sounds, syllables, or words, particularly at the beginning of sentences (normal dysfluencies). These developmental dysfluencies occur
between the ages of 2.5 and 4 years old when the language, motor, and
emotional systems are developing. These dysfluencies may occur as the
child struggles to try to express more complex ideas in a rapid and
precise manner.
Child-­onset stuttering disorder also typically begins between 2 and
4 years of age. Onset of symptoms varies from pronounced stuttering
within a few days to gradual worsening of symptoms across months.
Symptoms may ebb and flow, including disappearing for weeks before
returning, especially among young children. From 40% to 75% of
young children who stutter will stop spontaneously, typically within
months of starting. Although predicting which child will stop stuttering is difficult, risk factors for persisting include stuttering for >1 year,
continued stuttering after age 6 years, and experiencing other speech
or language problems. Additionally, certain types of dysfluencies are
typically seen only in child-­onset stuttering disorder.

Types of Dysfluencies

Dysfluencies interrupt the normal flow of speech through repeated
or prolonged sounds, syllables, or words. Types of dysfluency that
are not exclusive to children who stutter include interjections (“well,
uhh, umm”), hesitations (pause), revisions (“I thought . . . I mean”),
and phrase repetitions (“Did you say—Did you say”). In addition, the
perspective of the speaker and cause of the dysfluency differ between
true stuttering disorders and other types of dysfluency. The dysfluencies might sound the same but occur for different reasons. For example,
a typically developing child with dysfluency may talk around a word or
use a completely different word because of issues with word retrieval,
complex thought formulation, or distractibility. But for children who
stutter, they may talk around a word or retrieve a completely different
word because even though they know exactly what they want to say,
they are unable to produce or “get” the sounds out. This highlights the
notion that stuttering is about more than what the listener observes.
The “moment of stuttering” is different because something occurs that
only the person who stutters can perceive.
Dysfluencies that occur in child-­onset stuttering vary in type, frequency, and longevity. Specifically, children who stutter show greater
part-­word repetition (“b-­b-­b-­b-­but”), single-­syllable word repetition
(“My, my, my”), sound prolongation (“MMMMMM-­an”), and in more
severe cases, blocking. Blocking is a dysfluent behavior that is identified by a fleeting or sometimes lengthy blockage of the flow of air
at the level of the vocal folds or articulators (tongue, teeth, and lips).
Typically, the child has initiated an articulatory posture (tongue is in
the position to produce “k”), but she is unable to release any air and/
or phonation (i.e., voice). Often in response to this inability to produce sounds or words, the child will develop secondary behaviors that
recruit movement from other parts of the body that the child feels they
have more “control” over.
These types of behaviors and movements exist only within child-­
onset stuttering disorder. They are referred to as secondary characteristics, or physical concomitants that often occur as a response to
stuttering. Common secondary characteristics include movements of
the head (head turning or jerking), face (eye blinking/squinting, grimacing, opening or tightly closing the jaw), neck (tightening), and
limbs (stomping feet, slapping hand); an increase in body tension; and
irregular patterns of inhalations and exhalations.

Emotional Symptoms and Stuttering

Fear and anxiety are emotional symptoms associated with stuttering. Many people experience some level of fear and anxiety related to
speaking in front of a group, but children who stutter often experience high levels of fear and anxiety related to all speaking situations,

especially ones that occur with newer or unfamiliar people (e.g., ordering at a restaurant, calling a store to ask about store hours, introducing
oneself). Along with their own feelings interfering with speech production, the reactions of those around them may also increase the anxiety
of children who stutter. Negative interactions or comments may inhibit
a child’s future attempts to interact verbally with another person or in a
group setting. Consider also the potential social challenges associated
with entering a classroom for the first time, transitioning to middle/
high school/college, beginning a job, dating, and so on. Not surprisingly, just as avoiding production of a perceived sound or word is
common, avoidance of situations and people is a common way of coping with the anxiety created by the fear of stuttering. These avoidance
behaviors indicate a need for intervention.

Differential Diagnosis

Although many dysfluencies are often referred to as stuttering, it is
important to recognize that there are different types of fluency disorders. Cluttering is a fluency disorder that may occur with or separate
from stuttering but is different in form and cause. Stuttering and cluttering have been identified to exist on a continuum. Unlike stuttering, for which distinct episodes can be identified and even counted,
cluttering affects the entire speech output and is often diagnosed
around age 7 years or later. In addition to elevated repetitions of partial words (as in stuttering), whole words, and phrases, those who
clutter show speech bursts that are often choppy, and articulation can
be slurred and imprecise. In addition, there is often an increase in
disorganization of their language, unusual prosody, and listener perception of a fast rate of talking. The level of awareness of how their
speech affects those listening, unlike children who stutter, is minimal for those who clutter. In fact, children with a cluttering disorder
often experience a decrease in their dysfluent behaviors when they
are speaking in front of a group because of an increased focus on
their speech, whereas the impact for children who stutter is exactly
the opposite.
In addition to cluttering, neurogenic (result of a stroke, head trauma,
or other neurologic damage) and psychogenic (associated with psychologic trauma) stuttering also exist, though they rarely occur in childhood. Stuttering can also be confused with dysfluent speech that occurs
for other neurologic reasons (e.g., Tourette syndrome, cerebral palsy,
spasmodic dysphonia).

Epidemiology

Approximately 5% of children experience stuttering, with the highest rates among young children. Seldom does a child begin stuttering
before 2 years of age or after 12 years; in fact, the mean age of onset is
2-­4 years, and most children stop stuttering within 4 years of onset.
Symptoms will disappear within 4 weeks for a minority of children.
Stuttering is more common in males than in females, and the magnitude of the difference increases as children get older. The ratio among
children <5 years is approximately 2:1 and jumps to 4:1 among adolescents and young adults.

Genetics

There is convergent evidence of a genetic link for childhood-­onset fluency disorder. Concordance rates among monozygotic twins range
from 20% to 83%, and for dizygotic twins, 4–19%. Family aggregation
studies suggest increased incidence of approximately 15% among first-­
degree relatives of those affected, three times higher than the 5% rate
for the general population. The variance in risk for stuttering attributed
to genetic effects is high, ranging from 70% to 85%. Although evidence
is limited, stuttering appears to be a polygenic condition, and several
genes increase susceptibility.

Brain Structure and Function

Brain structure and function abnormalities found among individuals who stutter include deficits in white matter in the left hemisphere,
overactivity in the right cortical region, and underactivity in the auditory cortex. Abnormal basal ganglia activation has also been identified.

EVALUATION
Comorbidities

Despite the widely held belief in a high degree of comorbidity between
childhood-­onset fluency disorder and other communication disorders,
research to date does not necessarily support this association. SLPs
consistently report high rates of comorbidity, although this would be
expected in clinical samples. Speech sound (phonologic) disorders are
the most commonly reported comorbidities, occurring in 30–40% of
children seen by SLPs. However, studies have not found greater incidence of phonologic disorders among those who stutter compared to a
control group. Similarly, SLPs report a much higher percentage of children with language disorders among their patients who stutter than the
approximately 7% expected in the population at large, yet studies find
the language functioning among individuals who stutter is no different
than in the general population. The same pattern holds for learning
disorders (LDs).
Children who stutter seem to experience more anxiety than their
nonstuttering peers, although research is limited. The frequency
of reported anxiety increases with age. Social anxiety and generalized anxiety disorder are common among adolescents who stutter.
Although one should not assume that an individual who stutters
will have an increased risk for any specific psychiatric disorder,
assessing for anxiety is important, as children who stutter frequently avoid situations that demand speaking, as discussed earlier
in the chapter.
Children who stutter have consistently been found to be bullied more than peers. In one study, these children were almost four
times more likely to be bullied than their nonstuttering counterparts. About 45% of children who stuttered reported having been
the victim of bullying.

Referral to Speech and Language Pathology

In deciding who to refer to an SLP, it is important to distinguish
developmental dysfluencies from stuttering. In addition to the risks
noted in Table 52.5, indications for referral include three or more
dysfluencies per 100 syllables (b-­b-­but; th-­th-­the; you, you, you),
secondary characteristics denoting escape or avoidance behaviors
(pauses, head nod, blinking), discomfort or anxiety while speaking,
family history of stuttering or other speech-­language disorders, and
suspicion of an associated neurologic or psychotic disorder. Most
children with persistent stuttering after age 4 years should be evaluated by an SLP.
As a part of the evaluation, the SLPs will be able to address the many
pressing concerns and worries of a parent whose child is stuttering. The
outcome of a speech-­language evaluation for stuttering should accomplish the following:
1.	Obtain a strong family history related to the existence of speech and
language disorders in general and more specifically related to stuttering and dysfluencies.
2.	Interview the parent or child about the child’s stress when speaking
in various situations.
3.	Record a speech sample to analyze the type, frequency, and complexity of the dysfluent behaviors and secondary characteristics that
the child is producing.
4.	Differentiate between developmental dysfluency behaviors, other
causes of dysfluent behaviors, and a child-­onset dysfluency disorder
(aka stuttering).
5.	Develop a plan with the family that involves a combination of direct
and indirect speech and language therapy, parent education, and
home programming.

TREATMENT

A true stuttering disorder is a lifelong condition. To date, no evidence
supports the use of a pharmacologic agent to treat stuttering in children and adolescents, and there is no cure for stuttering. However,
treatment in preschool-­age children has been shown to improve stuttering. In fact, speech-­language therapy is most effective when initiated during the preschool period. The broad focus of therapy allows for
minimizing the adverse effects of the condition.
Based on the child’s age, types and frequency of stuttered behaviors,
severity of secondary characteristics, and impact on the child’s qualify
of life, the SLP will decide if a less direct or more direct therapeutic
intervention is recommended.
Less direct therapy focuses on manipulating the situation and environment while allowing the child to experience increased fluency. Most
preschool children respond to interventions taught by SLPs that are
accompanied by behavioral feedback strategies implemented by parents
and teachers. It is important to recognize that parental pressure or speaking pressure does not cause stuttering. A less direct therapy approach
involves working with the caregiver to accomplish the following:
1.	Limit situations and expectations that cause increased dysfluencies
and stress
2.	Demonstrate and model how to adjust speaking rate and complexity
of language rather than reprimanding children for their speech errors or asking them to slow down
3.	Increase opportunities for the child to experience fluent communication
More direct therapy is recommended and implemented when less
direct therapy did not have an impact on the stuttering behaviors, the
child has increasing worries related to stuttering, the child has a high
risk of continuing to stutter, or the child is older and has been stuttering for some time. One of the overarching goals of the therapy implemented by an SLP is to help the child experience increased fluency and
strategies to learn how to “stutter” better.
Therapy that is more direct adds the following elements:
1.	Awareness and education: Recognizing and accepting that their speech
is different, identifying and naming types of speech, nonjudgmentally
noting episodes of stuttering using selected words and phrases (which
are often accompanied by pictures) that were developed with and
practiced by the child (“That was a bit bumpy”), appreciating others’
reaction to the child when stuttering, managing secondary behaviors,
admitting they are a person who stutters, and addressing avoidance
behaviors as a result of the stress and anxiety they are experiencing.
2.	Fluency-­shaping behaviors: Regulating rate of speech and breathing
and helping the child gradually progress from the fluent production
of syllables to more complex sentences. The child should be involved
in opportunities to identify speech disfluencies, implement self-­
correction, and respond to requests (“Can you say that again?”).
Because stuttering rarely disappears, the thrust of therapy is often to
“improve” the type of stuttering, decrease the occurrences of stuttering,
and develop strategies for coping with the fear and anxiety that will
continue to occur in various speaking opportunities.
Appreciating that dysfluency is a broad term and stuttering can be
one of the causes for this behavior allows pediatricians to have a more
accurate understanding of the symptoms, causes, and treatments associated with dysfluencies. Being armed with this information allows the
provider to include in their referral to an SLP an accurate description
of symptomology, which will be beneficial in the planning and execution of their initial evaluation.

Chapter 54

Augmentative and
Alternative Communication
Michelle M. Macias
Children must develop communicative competence to interact with
others, to influence their environment, and to participate fully in society. If children are not able to effectively communicate, they will have
minimal means to express what they need, exchange information with
others, and develop social skills and relationships. Some children are
unable to communicate effectively through natural means, including
speech, gestures, or writing (see Chapter 53). These children with complex communication needs (CCNs) have more independent function through augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)
methods to meet their communication needs and to avoid significant
restrictions on their participation in all aspects of life.
AAC interventions have been helpful for individuals with no speech,
limited speech, and those at risk for speech-­language disorders; this
includes individuals who rely on speech but need augmentation to
enhance speech, those recovering from a traumatic brain injury, and
those who may have temporary conditions affecting communication.
AAC has changed from an emphasis on providing the means to express
needs and wants to the recognition that communication must also foster exchange of information, development of social relationships, and
participation in social routines. In addition, there is recognition that
communication needs extend beyond face-­to-­face interactions and
also include written communication in the school setting and even
social media in peer communities.

DEFINITIONS

According to the American Speech-­
Language-­Hearing Association
(ASHA), AAC is “an area of clinical practice that addresses the needs
of individuals with significant and complex communication disorders
characterized by impairments in speech-­language production and/or
comprehension, including spoken and written modes of communication.” AAC encompasses the communication methods used to supplement or replace speech or writing for those with impairments in the
production or comprehension of spoken or written language. In pediatrics, AAC is used by youth with a wide range of speech and language
impairments, including cerebral palsy (CP), traumatic brain injury,
intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and apraxia
of speech. In addition, children and adolescents hospitalized in intensive care units can benefit from AAC.
AAC is augmentative when used to supplement existing speech
and alternative when used in place of speech that is absent or not
functional. AAC uses a wide variety of electronic and nonelectronic
techniques from low technology to high technology, including manual
signs, gestures, tangible objects, line drawings, picture communication boards and letter boards, and speech-­generating devices. The term
assistive technology (AT) is a more general term describing systems
and devices that alleviate the effects of a disability and improve function, for example, bracing for a child with a neuromotor impairment
as well as AAC.

Prevalence

Across countries, the overall prevalence of AAC use ranges from
approximately 1.2% to 1.5% of the population; worldwide up to 0.6% of
the school-­age population has a severe speech impairment. A national
survey of U.S. special educators reported that approximately 18% of
students served in special education use a form of AAC for communication, with 7% using gestural modes, 6.5% using pictorial supports,
and 4.8% using a speech-­generating device (SGD). However, not all

U.S. children with developmental disabilities or children with special
healthcare needs have their communication needs met. The more
severe a child’s communication deficit, the more likely the child would
benefit from AAC support.
Across particular pediatric populations, it has been estimated that
25–50% of children with ASD have limited speech and would benefit
from AAC. Up to 45% of children with CP use AAC either exclusively
or to supplement speech. Several studies have found that in intensive
care units ∼30% of patients had communication breakdowns and met
AAC candidacy criteria, although alternative communication modes
were rarely used.

Goals of Communicative Interactions and AAC
Interventions

The ultimate goal of AAC is to enable individuals to effectively engage
in interactions and participate in activities of their choosing. Broadly
speaking, the goals of AAC interventions are to assist individuals with
meeting their current communication needs and prepare them to
meet their future communication needs. Communicative interactions
can be said to fulfill four purposes: (1) communicate needs/wants, (2)
transfer information, (3) social closeness, and (4) social etiquette. It is
important to remember that adequacy of communication depends on
the personal goals of the person using AAC, and the definition of success may vary by the professionals involved.
Most children with complex communication needs demonstrate
some ability to communicate using speech, although some are entirely
nonverbal. The effectiveness of natural speech for communication can
be divided into 10 levels (Meaningful Use of Speech Scale; Robbins &
Osberger):
1.	Makes vocal sounds in communicative exchanges
2.	Gets another person’s attention using speech
3.	Uses various vocal sounds depending on the intention and content
of messages
Uses speech for communication about:
1.	Known topics with familiar people
2.	Known topics with unfamiliar people
3.	New topics with familiar people
4.	New topics with unfamiliar people
5.	Messages that are understood by familiar people
6.	Messages that are understood by unfamiliar people
7.	Clarification messages as needed when communication breakdown
occurs

AAC Systems

An “AAC system” refers to the integrated group of components used
to support and enhance communication. These components include
the specific forms of AAC, selection techniques, and strategies for use.
Individuals with complex communication needs must have access to
a wide range of means to enhance their communication and participate
fully within social and educational contexts. This may include unaided
AAC, which does not require an external tool and requires some
degree of motor control (e.g., gestures, sign language, finger spelling,
speech approximations), or aided AAC, which requires either an electronic or a nonelectronic tool. Nonelectronic aided forms are referred
to as low-­tech aided AAC and include options such as communication boards/books, picture-­exchange communication systems (PE or
PECS, pictures, photographs), or visual schedules. Electronic forms are
referred to as mid-­tech or high-­tech AAC systems and include traditional speech-­generating devices (SGDs) or voice output communication aids (VOCAs), recordable devices, and computer/tablet options
and applications (“apps”). SGDs/VOCAs include multiple options.
Single-­level devices have pictures/words on a single-­level display,
whereas multilevel devices can have vocabulary programmed on more
than one level. Static display devices keep the same display, and the
user can sequence symbols or words to generate a message. Dynamic
display devices are usually those with a touch screen for the display in
which pages can change using navigation keys and link buttons. Text-­
to-­speech devices enable the user to spell messages that convert to synthesized speech. Some dynamic display devices include text-­to-­speech

and use symbols as well as text. Table 54.1 provides examples of the
range of AAC systems.
Mobile technology (e.g., iPad) and greater use of social media tools
have increased acceptance of AAC and reduced attitudinal barriers to
AAC use. However, the increased diversity of communication tools
also means increased operational demands, given that each tool is
designed with different representations, organizations, and layouts of
information as well as different access techniques (e.g., swiping, tapping). Each design may reflect different motor, cognitive, perceptual,
and linguistic learning demands. A combination of gestures/signs,
low-­technology systems, mobile technology devices, and SGDs can
provide AAC users with the most effective communication options
to suit their needs.

AAC Teams

AAC teams serving individuals with CCNs are the groups of people
that guide the AAC intervention decision-­making process and implement communication supports. Team members include the children
and adolescents with CCN themselves, parents/caregivers, and professionals playing a variety of roles.
Children with CCN. The most important member of the team is the
individual relying on AAC techniques. The role may change in response
to the individual’s maturation and capability, but to the extent possible,
the child or adolescent should participate in the decision-­making process regarding goals, social relationships, and support options related
to the AAC system and interventions.
AAC facilitators. The term facilitator refers to parents/family members, friends, professionals, and frequent communication partners who
assume some responsibility for keeping the AAC system operational
and/or supporting the person with CCN to use it effectively. They support communication interactions by coaching, serving as interpreters,
and/or helping resolve communication breakdowns. Importantly, the
role of facilitator is to support independent communication by the
individual with CCN, not to communicate for the individual.
AAC specialists. AAC specialists provide direct AAC intervention services by instructing and educating about AAC and designing and implementing AAC interventions. AAC specialists work
with clinicians and educators, such as speech-­language pathologists, occupational therapists, teachers, and pediatric healthcare
providers who provide clinical and educational services to youth
with CCN.

AAC Assessment

AAC assessment involves gathering information so that informed decisions can be made about the adequacy of current communication, the
communication needs, the AAC techniques that are most appropriate,
how to provide instruction in AAC techniques, and how to evaluate
outcomes. Proper evaluation and support for the use of AAC devices
are of paramount importance.
Studies comparing acquisition of communication skills reveal few
differences in terms of how quickly many children can learn to use
some of the available AAC options. For example, PEC and sign language comparison studies vary—some show PECs were acquired more
easily than signing, and others suggest both PECs and signing were

acquired at an equal pace. Studies comparing PECs with SGDs similarly vary in terms of effectiveness of device use.
Physicians, therapists, and other professionals who prescribe AAC
must make sure the child (and family) receives training and monitoring for using the device and that the device is accessible across settings
in which the child functions (e.g., home, school, community activities). A substantial number of AAC devices are abandoned shortly
after implementation without support for their use. AAC assessment
and intervention is a dynamic process, and usually ongoing, as often
the children and adolescents requiring the AAC system are unable to
speak or write because of physical, cognitive, language, and/or sensory
impairments. Assessment generally consists of four phases as outlined
here:
Phase 1: Referral. The “finder” role is an important role for pediatric
healthcare providers. They may be the impetus for recognizing that
a child has a CCN and that an AAC intervention may be helpful.
They then assist the patient and their family by initiating a referral
to an appropriate resource. The pediatric provider can support the
AAC funding application by certifying a medical diagnosis and signing a prescription for the recommended service. Although the role
is episodic, it is nonetheless a key role in the AAC assessment and
treatment process.
Phase 2: Initial Assessment. The goal of this phase is to gather information to design an AAC intervention to match the child’s existing needs and capabilities. The AAC specialist(s) assesses the child’s
current communication interaction needs and his or her physical,
cognitive, language, and sensory abilities. This typically focuses on
enabling communicative interactions between the child and familiar
AAC facilitators. The intervention is refined as the child learns about
the operational requirements of the AAC system and the AAC team
gathers information on how well the system works for the child.
Demonstrations and simulators are available to help with training
before the actual equipment is ordered.
Phase 3: Assessment for Other Settings. The goal is to develop a solid
communication system that supports the child with CCN in a variety of environments, including home, school, and recreational
environments. A child must have access to a system that allows educational and social participation.
Phase 4: Follow-­Up Assessment. This involves maintaining a comprehensive AAC system that accommodates the child’s changing
capabilities. The communication equipment must be examined
regularly to assess the needs of new communication partners, detect replacement/repair needs, and reassess the child’s capabilities
as they change.

Specific Assessment Details

Assess Current Communication. The initial step is to assess the effectiveness of the child’s current communication system. The assessment of
communication access focuses on the operational and social aspects
of communicative competence. A child with spastic quadriplegia, for
example, may be unable to use eye gaze consistently and therefore
operationally unable to use an eye-­gaze AAC system. On the other
hand, a minimally verbal adolescent with ASD may be able to operate
an electronic AAC device but never use it to initiate a social interaction.

338 Part IV u Learning and Developmental Disorders
Some questions to ask regarding current communication behaviors in
children with CCN include the following:
u What are the various methods your child uses to communicate? Examples: words/speech, vocalizations, gestures, signing, communication board, eye gaze, typing, and so on.
u 
What body part is used for each technique (e.g., left/right hand,
eyes)?
u On a scale of 1 to 5, how accurately and efficiently is your child able
to use this technique?
u On a scale of 1 to 5, how well is your child able to use this technique
in an interactive, socially appropriate manner?
Screening Tools. Various screening instruments exist that help document communication behaviors. These include the Communication
Matrix; the Inventory of Potential Communicative Acts (IPCA); and
the Social Communication, Emotional Regulation, Transactional
Support (SCERTS) Model Assessment, among others. The Communication Matrix focuses on individuals using any form of communication (presymbolic or AAC), and the IPCA focuses primarily
on presymbolic communicators with physical and/or developmental
disabilities. The SCERTS Model Assessment focuses on communication and social regulation behaviors in verbal and nonverbal children
with ASD.
Assess Potential to Use or Increase Speech. A key issue in AAC assessment for children with CCN is whether AAC is needed to augment
insufficient speech or serve as a replacement for speech. Parents are
often concerned that using an AAC device will negatively affect speech
development, as the child will have access to an “easier” alternative.
The use of AAC techniques does not inhibit natural speech; conversely,
AAC may enhance spoken language by supporting the development of
communicative competence and language skills.
Assess Potential for Environmental Adaptations. Modifications of
physical spaces or structures may be relatively straightforward or more
complex, depending on the specific situation. For example, at home,
furniture rearrangement or renovations to adapt the home to accommodate AAC devices may be necessary. In the school, desks/tables may
need to be raised/lowered or a vertical workspace may need to be created with a slanted board.

Specific Issues Regarding AAC for Children with
Disabilities
Cerebral Palsy

Communication impairments are commonly seen in children with
CP, both related to impaired (motor) speech intelligibility and language disorders (see Chapter 638.1). The incidence of dysarthria varies
depending on the type of CP and degree of motor impairment. Language impairments are associated with intellectual functioning and
hearing loss, if present.
More than any other disability, communication interventions for
children with CP require a multidisciplinary team approach. The wide
variety of motor impairments entails the involvement of occupational
and physical therapists, orthotics specialists, rehabilitation engineers,
and speech-­language pathologists. Positioning and seating adaptations
may need to be developed for optimum stability and to allow efficient
movement to access the AAC system. The team must consider the wide
range of options available and what is necessary to optimally match
the child with the system being used. Although up to half of children
with CP may be able to access the AAC device through use of a finger,
others will need alternative access techniques, including chin pointers,
joysticks, optical indicators, or switches.
Emphasis on AAC needs to be balanced with other developmental
interventions, including speech-­language therapy, motor development
training, and academic instruction. Some will require extensive motor
training to be able to use alternative access methods such as eye tracker,
head mouse, or a switch for scanning. Although speech, gestures, and
facial expressions may be affected as a result of motor impairment,
patients should still be encouraged in using these natural modes for
communication. A balanced approach supports the use of multimodal
systems, which can vary according to the situation. A child with CP
may be able to communicate effectively with family members using

natural speech and gestures but may need to rely on AAC techniques
with unfamiliar partners.
Long-­term planning for adulthood is essential, given the need to rely
on AAC devices and techniques that can accommodate the range of
demands that are communicative in nature, including interpersonal,
academic, and employment demands. Without advance planning,
AAC systems are unlikely to meet all these demands, or the individual
will not have all the skills required to use the systems.

Intellectual Disability

As defined by the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD), intellectual disability (ID; see Chapter 57) is characterized by “significant limitations both in intellectual
functioning and adaptive behavior as expressed in conceptual, social,
and practical skills.” Appropriate supports, including AAC supports,
can have a significant impact on the ability of individuals with ID to
live and learn successfully in inclusive environments typical of their
same-­age peers. At least 30% of school-­age individuals requiring AAC
supports have an ID. One of the main barriers that exists for children
with ID is simply recognizing that the use of AAC can be beneficial and
that AAC use should be generalized across settings and not just used in
highly structured settings such as school.
Although most youth with ID do not engage in socially inappropriate behaviors, problem behaviors occur more frequently in this population compared to those without ID. Many individuals with ID do not
use speech as their primary mode of communication, and problem
behaviors can be exacerbated by difficulty communicating. Many of
the strategies used to support individuals with ID involve AAC strategies such as visual schedules or those used to teach choice making and
functional communication training.
The nature of interventions directed at both natural speech development and AAC varies considerably given the diversity of syndromes
and conditions that result in ID. Many individuals with ID may have
multiple diagnoses that affect the nature of their intervention needs.

Autism Spectrum Disorder

ASD (see Chapter 58) is a highly variable disorder; individuals with
ASD experience a wide range of complex issues related to language and
communication, which presents challenges regarding speech-­based
and AAC interventions. Individuals with ASD and ID may require
more extensive educational, behavioral, and community supports
compared with those without ID, but those without ID still require
supports in the core area of social communication. Language forms
are the language structures and vocabulary (e.g., grammar, syntax).
Language function refers to what individuals do with language as
they engage and interact with others. Because ASD affects the nature of
communication as a social mediator, it is important that AAC interventions emphasize the function, or pragmatic aspects of communication,
as well as the communication aspects related to the form of language.
Interventions must start at the individual’s level of social, communicative, and cognitive development and build skills in a natural
developmental progression. The development of dynamic, interactive
communication is critical, and the child with ASD needs to learn to use
communication skills related to functional activities in daily life. The
developmental profiles of youth with ASD are often characterized by an
uneven distribution of skills. Children with ASD often perform much
better with object permanence and tool use (causality) than those areas
requiring interpersonal interaction, such as gestural or vocal imitation,
symbolic understanding, or language comprehension. Therefore AAC
interventions must be geared to the child’s social and linguistic abilities
rather than the child’s object abilities (e.g., fine motor skills or object
manipulation skills). Manual sign or pictorial systems (PECS) are often
recommended for nonverbal children with ASD. This often presumes
that the problem is only one of output and that communicative intent
is intact; however, the child may not have the language or the social
base on which communication must be built. Therefore interventions
should initially build imitation, joint attention, and natural gestural
communication skills before initiating formal language-­based AAC or
speech approaches.

Chapter 55 u Outcomes Among Infants and Children Who Are Deaf/Hard of Hearing
SGDs and other speech-­output technologies can be used effectively
in children with ASD to teach both communication and literacy skills.
SGDs can act as a “social bridge” to familiar and unfamiliar communicative partners. They can be programmed with whole messages (e.g., “do
you want to play”) in addition to single words and phrases and thereby
increase communicative efficiency and decrease potential communication
breakdowns. These output devices are available via touch-­screen tablet and
mobile devices.

Childhood Apraxia of Speech

ASHA defines childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) as a neurologic
speech-­sound disorder “in which the precision and consistency of
movements underlying speech are impaired in the absence of neuromuscular deficits.” Given consensus on diagnostic criteria is lacking,
ASHA recommends that the term “suspected CAS” be used. There is
consensus on motor speech behaviors in three areas: (1) inconsistent
errors on consonants and vowels in repeated syllables or words; (2)
lengthened, disrupted transitions between sounds and syllables; and
(3) inappropriate prosody of speech (see Chapter 53).
Given CAS is primarily a motor speech disorder, AAC is usually a secondary intervention, with the primary intervention focused on improving natural speech production. Because children with CAS often evidence
significant language delays related to the inability to practice language, it is
important to provide them with AAC modalities early on. The use of AAC
will not inhibit speech development and production, and generally use of
AAC supports result in increased mean length of utterances for the child.
Children with suspected CAS who benefit from traditional AAC are
those who primarily speak in single words, have largely unintelligible
speech, and are not able to effectively communicate with family members,
peers, and teachers. The children benefit from a wide range of AAC, from
unaided techniques including gestures and signs and aided techniques
such as PECS communication books and/or SGD. It is important that the
AAC device facilitates both language development and social competence.
The AAC system should be designed so that the child learns to create
­longer and more complex messages that are grammatically accurate.
Children with suspected CAS who can produce single-­word utterances but struggle with multiword speech often benefit from AAC speech
supplementation. This supplementation may be in the form of key symbol supplementation, in which they point to key symbols in conjunction
with speech. This can help with topic setting—when the child introduces a
new topic of conversation, they point to a symbol, which helps narrow the
range of possibilities for the communication partner. Often children with
suspected CAS prefer to use natural speech and unaided approaches, using
aided AAC techniques only when communication breakdown occurs.

Special Considerations

Reimbursement and Funding. The AAC specialist (usually a speech-­
language pathologist) should be familiar with public and private funding
options. Funding can come from schools, third-­party payers (private or
public insurance companies), or philanthropic sources. Low-­tech AAC
systems are usually developed by a speech-­language pathologist and do
not usually require additional funding. SGDs are considered durable
medical equipment (DME), and funding can vary immensely. Coverage
will need to be verified based on the patient’s specific needs and insurance. Pediatric care providers are often asked to sign prescriptions and/
or write letters of medical necessity for an AAC device. This should be
done only after conferring with the AAC team members, especially the
speech-­language pathologist. The letter should include that the pediatric provider received the evaluation reports, reviewed the recommendations, and agrees that the recommended AAC devices are medically
necessary for treatment of the child’s CCN associated with the specific
diagnosis. SGD vendors are often able to assist with funding questions.
The Assistive Technology Act. The Assistive Technology Act of
2004 provides all U.S. states and territories with federal funding to
increase access to AT devices and services. This information can be
found at the National Assistive Technology Act Technical Assistance
and training (AT3) Center (https://www.at3center.net/stateprogram).

Deaf/Hard of Hearing
Susan E. Wiley and Rachel D. St. John
See also Chapter 677.
Approximately 3 in every 1,000 infants in the United States are born
deaf or hard of hearing (D/HH). Additionally, for infants who pass
the newborn hearing screening, there are a number of risk factors for
developing delayed-­onset hearing loss at any time during infancy and
childhood. Given that the large majority of deaf infants are born to
hearing parents, there is the potential for a developmental crisis when
an infant or child does not have an accessible shared language in common with their parents.
Acquisition of one’s first language is a phenomenon of early development (see Chapter 53). The first months and years of a child’s life
are critical to developing an intact native language. When the process
of language acquisition is delayed or fragmented, as can happen with
an infant who is D/HH, it can have a significant and permanent effect
on overall lifetime cognitive development. Timely identification and
support of infants and children who are D/HH, including the provision of early access to language, is critical to the lifetime trajectory of
outcomes, including language, pragmatics, academic success, executive
functioning, and psychosocial well-­being.

DEAF CULTURE

It is important to recognize that we as authors do not speak for Deaf
individuals or parents of D/HH children but seek to bring awareness
of some fundamental norms as a starting point for increasing familiarity and collaboration with these groups. Readers are encouraged to
explore the resources cited in this chapter, as well as information provided by Deaf individuals and parents of D/HH children themselves.
Among individuals in America who are D/HH, there is a subset
who self-­designate as culturally Deaf (intentionally spelled with an
uppercase D) who share American Sign Language (ASL) as their primary means of communication and a set of beliefs and traditions that
are transmitted across generations. In the United States, the National
Association of the Deaf is the organizational body that supports and
represents this cultural Deaf community, with a mission “to preserve,
protect and promote the civil, human and linguistic rights of deaf and
hard of hearing people in the United States of America.”
There is a potential conflict between the “hearing” medical community and the culturally Deaf community, with the medical community
traditionally operating from a pathology model (identify and fix the
problem) and the Deaf community operating from a sociocultural one
(there is no problem in need of fixing). Hearing parents and professionals whose societal existence is grounded in listening and spoken
language often view being D/HH as a limitation to interpersonal connection, education, and vocation. Deaf individuals, who achieve virtually all the same milestones as hearing individuals do by using a visual
language medium, do not view being D/HH as a loss. Among culturally Deaf individuals, the terms “hearing loss” and “hearing impaired”
are often viewed as inaccurate and potentially offensive. For those who
were born deaf, the experience of hearing is something they never had
and therefore have never missed. It is not something that holds them
back, but instead is a source of maintaining a positive self-­identity and
pride in one’s culture and community.
Hearing clinicians caring for deaf infants and children or members of
the Deaf community must practice with the cultural humility necessary
to appreciate the perspectives of the Deaf community (see Chapter 2).

FALSE ASSUMPTION

ALTERNATIVE APPROACH

Being D/HH causes language delay.

Often, the parent and deaf infant do not share a common language, creating a language barrier leading
to delays. Early identification (by 1-­3 mo of age) and intervention by 6 mo of age are critical for language
development.

Passing newborn hearing screening
tests means one does not need to
be concerned about hearing.

Many factors can cause delayed-­onset hearing loss. A full audiologic evaluation is indicated for any
caregiver concern about hearing or for delays in language development—a “wait and see” approach is
never indicated.

All behavioral symptoms or
developmental delays are
caused by the hearing loss.

Young neurotypical deaf children with adequate access to language through amplification and spoken
language, sign language, or both should not be expected to have challenges in development, behavior,
or social engagement. Referral for evaluation is essential if these symptoms are present.

Sign language is a last resort for
communication for D/HH infants or
children.

American Sign Language (ASL) is a full and complex language with a clear syntax and grammar structure.
Learning sign language can promote language development when children cannot access spoken
language during a period when this input is critical for cortical brain development.

Including access to Deaf individuals as part of healthcare teams
involved in the care of D/HH infants and children is an important first
step in including this cultural perspective in health service delivery and
decision-­making.
It is also important to recognize the concept of intersectionality (the
interconnected nature of social categorizations such as race, ethnicity,
class, and gender), which plays a role in the Deaf community. Being
Deaf and Black is not just the sum of the experiences of Deaf individuals and Black individuals—the two constructs existing simultaneously
in the same person makes for a unique life experience. Intersectionality
is recognized within the context of the Deaf Plus community because
those individuals do not simply experience life as a Deaf person who
also happens to have an additional condition. The interplay of these
aspects of individuals is a critical part of identity formation, self-­
esteem, cultural engagement, potential experiences of disadvantage/
discrimination, and personhood in general.

EARLY DETECTION AND LANGUAGE
DEVELOPMENT

Deaf children who are born to deaf/signing parents are natively
exposed to sign language from the first day of life and subsequently
can be expected to acquire sign language milestones in a predictable
manner similar to typically developing hearing children acquiring
spoken language milestones. Deaf children of signing parents achieve
their first signs, vocabulary expansion, combining of two discrete sign
concepts, progression to more complex phrases and sentences, and
other language-­related milestones at expected ages if assessed in sign
language. However, more than 90% of deaf infants are born to hearing
parents who most often do not sign fluently. This creates an immediate
and significant loss of a shared intact language. Families will turn to
professionals for advice on making decisions regarding language, education, amplification technology, and social engagement. Sometimes
these clinicians make false assumptions that delay detection or intervention for children who are D/HH (Table 55.1).
Clinicians should be aware that although language delay may be a
presenting symptom in a D/HH child, being deaf in and of itself does
not inherently cause delayed language development. Rather, the inability for a parent and an infant to share a common accessible language
creates a barrier to the development of language. This is why early identification and support are critical for D/HH infants to support language
access, whether to spoken language through amplification and therapy
or access to sign language (or both). Even children who have passed
their newborn hearing screening who have language delays must have
a full audiologic evaluation, as a substantial number of factors can contribute to delayed-­onset hearing loss (DOHL) at any time during early,
middle, or late childhood. Parental concern about language delay or
responsiveness of their child is a sensitive, but not specific, indicator of
possible hearing loss. It is important to respond to parental concerns
of hearing or language with referrals for hearing assessment, language
evaluation, and age-appropriate therapeutic support systems.

Clinicians should also consider the possibility of hearing loss in
young children with other behavioral changes. An older child may
report a sudden dramatic hearing loss. However, younger children may
not have the linguistic capacity or awareness to describe loss of hearing and may present instead with changes in behavior (being upset,
aggressive, withdrawn). Some children with a progressive or sudden
change in hearing status may appear to have a behavioral condition
such as attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or may be
described as defiant. Children with unidentified hearing changes and
children with ADHD can share behaviors—they are perceived as not
paying attention, they often are not aware of what is happening in the
moment, they may not respond as expected when being addressed, and
they may not focus on the things that are being discussed.
Another problematic issue known as diagnostic overshadowing can
occur when all developmental or behavioral challenges are attributed
to one cause (in this case, hearing status) when the symptoms should
suggest the possibility of another disorder. For example young neurotypical D/HH children who have adequate access to language (through
amplification technology and spoken language, sign language, or a
combination of both) should not automatically be expected to have
substantial challenges with language development, behavior, and social
engagement. If clinicians reflexively attribute delays in social and language development to the fact that the child is D/HH, they may miss
the diagnosis of a developmental disorder when they would not have
missed the diagnosis in a hearing child.
Sign language has many benefits for D/HH infants and children
and should not be regarded as an inferior last resort only to be
used if spoken language efforts are not successful. ASL is a full and
complex language. Much of the grammatical structure and concept
complexity in ASL is conveyed through spatial placement of signs
and body movements. Body movements can include body lean and
eyebrow shift to indicate a question, furrowing of the brow and
pursing of lips to convey negation, and shifting of body position
in space to define multiple individuals involved in conversation, to
name a few.
The active discouragement of using visual language with any D/
HH child is a developmental disservice, particularly so with the profoundly deaf infant whose hearing level is too low to benefit from
traditional hearing aids. For these infants, a cochlear implant is
likely the only potential route for accessing spoken language input,
and the earliest that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently approves cochlear implantation is 9 months of age. There
remains a number of children who are not achieving such early ages
of cochlear implantation. Lack of access to sign language can mean
up to a year or more of complete lack of accessible linguistic input
during a period of cortical development when language input is
critical; that lack of language input can in turn affect infant bonding
with parents. Even after cochlear implantation, it takes a substantial
amount of therapy (auditory-­verbal/listening and speech-­language
therapy) to build spoken language skills.

Chapter 55 u Outcomes Among Infants and Children Who Are Deaf/Hard of Hearing
INTERVENTIONS

Supporting children who are D/HH requires a combination of a proactive approach to care, ongoing monitoring for delays in all developmental domains, and timely recognition and intervention of gaps that can
occur because of the impact of hearing status on language and overall
development.
There is a tendency, especially for those who are not familiar with D/
HH children, to assume that a child who does not hear will have reduced
developmental outcomes compared to their hearing peers. There is
robust evidence supporting the importance of early identification and
intervention for long-­term outcomes in children who are D/HH. A
child’s developmental and learning potential should not be defined by
their hearing; clinicians should encourage and support families’ high
expectations for a child’s development regardless of hearing status.
The medical home can fill a critical role in supporting a family’s journey,
though often primary care providers have relatively few children who are
D/HH in their practice and may not be well-­versed in how to monitor
the medical and psychosocial needs of a D/HH child. This prompts the
need to seek out information from a variety of sources and link families
with reputable information. Because D/HH is a low-­incidence condition,
it is challenging for one setting (early intervention–based, school-­based,
clinical-­based) to include a variety of children and match appropriate communication approaches. Interventions can be categorized in a variety of
ways. A framework for various communication approaches is commonly
used for understanding how to support language development in children
who are D/HH (Table 55.2), including technology and environmental
modifications.

Communication Approaches

Often different approaches to communication are presented as a choice to
make during the early years of critical language growth. Many communication approaches have passionate national organizations advocating for a
specific approach (Table 55.3). The educational philosophy known as total
communication is often misunderstood to mean using both signing and
spoken language; however, it refers to incorporating an array of communication modalities (formal signs and fingerspelling, gestures, body language,
lip reading, speaking, listening), with the goal of optimizing language
development that is tailored to be most effective for the individual child.
We have chosen to refer to the national organizations and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to guide definitions

341

of communication approaches (see Table 55.2). Each approach has
specific components needed for successful implementation and language outcomes. The overall goal to support communication development can be an unfolding journey. Choices and strategies that worked
well for a child in early childhood may not be as effective as the child
matures, particularly as social engagement and academic demands
evolve with age and advancement in school. Thus it is important for
families to recognize that communication needs can change over time,
prompting a shift from a prior decision to an alternative approach.

Technology
Hearing Aids

Hearing aid technology is very refined. Hearing aids are essentially mini-­
computers that take sound from the environment and are programmed
to adjust how this sound is processed and delivered to the ear. Hearing
aids have a number of different features that can augment the quality
of sound a child will hear. Hearing aids can analyze the sounds coming
into the device and preferentially reduce background noise. They can
compress sound waves to preferentially make soft sounds louder and
try to avoid distortion of loud sounds (wide dynamic range compression). Hearing aids can have microphones that can receive sound from
many directions or focus primarily on sounds coming from in front of
a child. A hearing aid can also carry a variety of programs for different listening settings. This allows a child to have a different program
for a quiet environment compared to a noisy environment. Technology can also include Bluetooth to link to other devices. There are a
number of apps to help monitor battery life and adjust the program for
the setting through the app. Follow-­up care with audiology is important to ensure continued supports for any amplification used and to
monitor for changes in hearing. For children with conductive hearing
changes, bone conduction aids may be indicated. These devices bypass
the outer and middle ear, conducting sound through the skull directly
to the cochlea and auditory nerve. When children are 5 years or older,
they can be considered for a surgically implanted bone conduction aid
called a bone-­anchored hearing aid (BAHA). These devices also have
the capacity to link to a frequency modulation (FM) system.
It is helpful to remember that even with advancements in technology, what children hear with hearing aids is not the same as
what people hear with a typically functioning auditory system. It is
equally important to consider environmental supports to optimize

listening environments. Contralateral routing of signal aids (CROS)
can be helpful for children with unilateral profound deafness. This
amplification system uses a transmitter at the ear that does not hear
and routes it to a receiver on the typically hearing ear. Assisted listening devices such as FM systems are used to help address problems hearing in background noise and when speakers are farther
away. This system has a small transmitter with a microphone. The
speaker wears the transmitter, and this then links directly into headphones or a personal amplification system (hearing aid or cochlear
implant). FM systems are traditionally used in the classroom setting, although they may be employed in other settings that tend to
have competing background noise such as restaurants or when the
focus on a particular individual speaking is important. The teacher
may also use a transmitter with microphone that links to a number
of speakers around the room (soundfield system). In this way, the
accommodation is available to all students in the classroom, may
benefit children easily distracted by background noise as well as the
D/HH student, and does not single out the D/HH child alone.

Cochlear Implants

Cochlear implants are surgically implanted devices that bring
direct electrical stimulation to the cochlea. These devices are FDA-­
approved for children 9 months and older with profound sensorineural hearing loss and in lesser degrees of hearing changes (70 dB
or more) when children are not receiving adequate benefit from

traditional amplification. A period of hearing aid trial is recommended before implantation. In children with hearing loss caused
by meningitis, it is important to monitor for bony changes in the
cochlea via imaging. Early signs of ossification would prompt earlier cochlear implantation to ensure the electrodes are in an optimal position to stimulate the auditory nerve. Even for children who
are bilaterally profoundly deaf, there can be reasons that a cochlear
implant is not appropriate. For example, absence of an auditory
nerve would preclude pursuing an implant.
Often pediatric cochlear implant centers use a multidisciplinary
approach to determining cochlear implant candidacy and to ensure
strong follow-­up support. In the past, children with developmental disabilities were deemed not appropriate for cochlear implantation, as results were thought to be limited. Although outcomes can
vary in this group of children, a developmental disability alone does
not preclude receiving benefit from the device. Ensuring global
developmental supports, addressing potential expectations and
outcomes, and linking children and families to resources can help
children gain benefit from access to sound.
Coordination of care and follow-­up is essential in all children
with cochlear implants. They initially will see audiologists at frequent intervals to program the implant, and speech therapy is a critical and ongoing component of fostering success with an implant.
At the age of 2 years, they should receive the 23-­valent pneumococcal vaccine to ameliorate the increased risk of meningitis. The

Chapter 55 u Outcomes Among Infants and Children Who Are Deaf/Hard of Hearing
medical home can play an important role in managing this additional immunization, as well as in monitoring medical issues and
developmental progress.
Early implantation has been associated with better hearing, speech
perception, and spoken language outcomes, as it ensures early stimulation of the auditory cortex necessary for the development of spoken
language. Although FDA approval is for children 9 months and older,
there are situations where earlier implantation is indicated, and many
in the field of pediatric audiology and pediatric otology are advocating
for earlier implantation. Unilateral deafness is another emerging indication for cochlear implantation in children.

Other Supports and Factors Influencing ­
Amplification Decisions

The cost of amplification devices can be quite high. Many insurance
plans do not cover hearing aids, though more cover costs associated
with BAHAs and cochlear implants. Services and coverages vary by
state and insurance plan. Families often need to obtain insurance
or additional coverage to cover replacement costs associated with
damage or loss of the device. Technology updates can also add further expenses.
There are also many day-­to-­day factors that affect a child’s acceptance of amplification. In early childhood there is rapid growth of
the skull and ear canal. With hearing aids, children often need to
return to audiology frequently to resize the ear molds to ensure a
good fit. Children also can become very adept at removing their
hearing aids. Young children in daycare are particularly vulnerable
to potentially losing their amplification when rolling, crawling, or
playing or when naturally curious peers and playmates attempt to
take them. Parents, caregivers, and teachers routinely checking on
hearing aids/cochlear implants is a critical support to using amplification technology successfully in young children.
A number of environmental supports can be helpful. For families
seeking a spoken language approach, it is helpful to decrease background sounds. Turning off TVs and devices can help children be
able to listen and hear what is said. Children often struggle hearing
speakers from a distance. This affects incidental learning, as they
have fewer opportunities to “overhear” peripheral conversations.
Families are often coached in ways to optimize their child’s listening
environment and ways to highlight spoken language and concepts.
Technologic support can include captioning on the television,
video-­relay with sign language interpreters, texting, speech-­to-­text,
visual fire alarms, and vibrating alarms. These types of technologies
are often not covered through insurance, although some state agencies have programs to help defray costs. Other accommodations
for communication access can include sign language interpreters,
cued speech interpreters, and open captioning. The Americans with
Disabilities Act ensures children, adolescents, and adults have the
legal right to communication access. This is particularly important
in medical settings. Family members should not be asked to serve as
interpreters for the child, as this limits the ability for the parent to
listen and be part of the conversation or may limit the child’s access
to the conversation at hand.

LANGUAGE LEARNING

Language is a critical component of the human condition and allows
connection with others. The United Nations has recognized communication as a human right. Communication happens in many ways that
can include behavior, nonverbal communication, tone, facial expressions, words, and sentences. These aspects of communication are universal irrespective of mode of communication.
Promoting language development needs to focus on far more than the
ear and hearing. As in typical children, the quality and quantity of communication are important (see Chapter 53). Additionally, children who
are D/HH are at high risk of missing learning via “the unwritten curriculum”: social and cultural learning that occurs incidentally and passively.
Hearing children repeatedly overhear conversations that do not directly
include them but are related to them, such as when their parents talk to
the pediatrician about their care or how the parents interface with office

343

staff when they schedule the next appointment. D/HH children are vulnerable to missing years, if not decades, of incidental learning regarding
everyday interactions. Direct teaching of incidental information, or making the implicit explicit, is a tenet of supporting the language development
of children and youth who are D/HH. In the medical setting, this can be
addressed for the signing D/HH child by having a sign language interpreter present to ensure the child can build an understanding of their own
health history and expand health literacy, even if they may be too young
to engage in the conversation directly. Although it may feel more comfortable and efficient to get information directly from parents, it is critical
for the provider to engage the child directly as much as possible to maximize their involvement in their own plan of care. Addressing incidental
learning for children who are D/HH should occur regardless of mode of
communication.
As families hold an important role in their child’s language development, building and empowering families in the development of
skills and strategies is an important component of early intervention.
Within the field of early intervention, coaching parents on how to
engage and interact with their child to promote optimal development
has been noted to be effective for a number of populations of children. Communication is interactional, and coaching puts the family
in the position of providing the intervention and thus builds skills to
support their child.

When a Child Is Not Progressing

If a child’s language development is not progressing, it is necessary
to reevaluate factors that could contribute to language development. Factors to consider include problems with devices that have
not been fully optimized, aspects of access to language, and coexisting medical, developmental, or behavioral conditions impacting
learning.
In evaluating a child’s access to language, consider how the child is
learning, the language environment, and whether a child is getting a
quality language model for learning. If a communication modality is
pursued that cannot be supported across the environments the child
is in (e.g., school, home, community-­based organizations), the D/HH
child can lag behind their peers. Overt problematic scenarios include
a deaf child without good acoustic access attempting to learn spoken language or a child learning sign language but with limited sign
language proficiency in their home, community, and school environments. Regression of language should prompt reevaluation of hearing
and consideration of brain-centered as opposed to hearing-centered
problems with learning.
A child’s response to a communication approach may be affected
by broader developmental issues. A child may have a unique learning profile and benefit from alternative approaches to language-­
based learning. Whereas children who are D/HH often have strong
visual problem-­solving skills, some children who are D/HH are
stronger in the auditory domain. Although it should not be automatically assumed that a D/HH child will have developmental delay,
up to 40% also have a developmental disability or condition that can
affect progress. Early recognition of a child’s broader needs can help
ensure children receive effective interventions for all of their needs.

ACADEMIC CONSIDERATIONS

The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) ensures a
free, appropriate public education for all students with disabilities,
including those who are D/HH. This law recognizes the right to
be educated within the least restrictive environment (LRE), or to
the maximum extent that is appropriate, education with their peers
who do not have disabilities. This must be balanced with the individual student’s communication, linguistic, academic, social, emotional, and cultural needs. Because of the varied settings and range
of communication support needs, as well as the diversity of individual student strengths, endorsing one specific educational setting
is not possible or appropriate.
Reading and literacy skills are associated with language fluency
levels and tend to be improved by early age of identification and
intervention. Standardized achievement testing from the early

2000s demonstrated that only half of D/HH high school graduates
were reading above a fourth-­grade level. However, these data are old
and do not control for varying factors across students such as coexisting medical or developmental conditions, delays in identification
and early language access, and varying teaching methodologies.
Academic outcomes are likely to be optimized with early identification and support of language in infants who are D/HH and with
the prompt recognition of, and support for, other developmental or
behavioral challenges that may interfere with learning.

PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-­BEING

An important consideration for any individual is psychosocial
well-­being. Because the population of D/HH individuals is heterogenous, it is difficult to make overarching statements regarding
mental health and wellness. Hearing loss in the elderly has been
associated with depression. This is due—at least in part—to the loss
of connection and communication with others. Similar effects can
be seen across the life span for deaf individuals who did not develop
enough formal language to communicate effectively. Studies have
linked a lack of language proficiency with in-­patient psychiatric
care in adults and psychosocial difficulties in children. A large-­scale
study in Taiwan spanning over a decade estimated an 11.1% lifetime
prevalence of clinically diagnosed unspecified anxiety disorder in
the D/HH group, which was twice the incidence in the hearing control group.
A phenomenon described by some D/HH individuals, deaf anxiety, is related to interpersonal challenges a D/HH individual can
experience when interfacing with a largely hearing society. Although
advances in technology with hearing aids and cochlear implants
continue to improve access to audiologic input, it is important to
consider that these are tools with inherent limitations—they are not
an equivalent “replacement” for natural hearing. D/HH adults have
described fears such as missing/misunderstanding information,
concern with appearing not to be interested in or not paying attention to someone speaking, disproportionately increased difficulty
when dealing with noisy environments, and worry about missing
significant information in nonaccessible environments such as
being unaware that a fire alarm has gone off if there is no visual
indicator in addition to the sound alarm.
The experiences of a deaf person in a predominantly hearing
world contribute to the critical journey of identity formation for D/
HH children as they become young adults. Deaf children, regardless
of their success with technology, are still deaf. When a child takes
off their hearing aids or cochlear implants to take a bath, swim, or
rest, they are deaf. The technology does not change who they are
fundamentally. Supporting families in their efforts to understand,
accept, and value their child as a deaf individual can provide resilience for identity formation in adolescence. There also needs to be
recognition that families are necessarily thrust into a position of
making decisions for their young D/HH child with the knowledge
they have at the time and may have concerns about how their child
as an emerging adult may feel later on about those decisions. Families can benefit tremendously from access to programs that can connect them with other deaf children, deaf adults, and community
resources that support a variety of ways to exist as a successful deaf
individual.

DEAF PLUS

It is helpful to recognize that some of the risks associated with being
D/HH are also risks for other conditions that impact functioning
in children who are D/HH (Table 55.4). It is important to look
beyond hearing status as the reason for delays so as not to miss
other factors contributing to a child’s slow rate of progress. Delayed

recognition of these factors causes delays in accessing effective
intervention strategies. Conversely, the presence of specific coexisting conditions should not be assumed to predict functioning or
decisions about communication. A child who is deaf and also has
cerebral palsy should not be assumed to be unable to use sign language because of impact on hand/arm movements, as these children
may use sign language receptively for language understanding quite
well. The need for individually tailored care and education plans is
particularly critical in children who are Deaf Plus.
Children who are D/HH have vision changes at nearly twice the
rates compared to the general population. Vision differences are
important to detect, as children who are D/HH often rely on their
vision for accessing information. Even among children who receive
effective amplification and good acoustic access to information,
some reliance on lip reading and visual attention to the speaker can
enhance a child’s ability to process information. There are no specific standards regarding the timing and frequency of ophthalmologic
evaluations and monitoring intervals, but it is important for all children who are D/HH to have regular monitoring of vision and eye
health with a pediatric eye care specialist.
For children who have both hearing and vision changes (DeafBlind), intervention strategies can be increasingly complex. IDEA
specifically defines DeafBlindness as “concomitant hearing and
visual impairments, the combination of which causes such severe
communication and other developmental and educational needs
that they cannot be accommodated in special education programs
solely for children with deafness or children with blindness.” When
the two conditions are present simultaneously, there are additional
challenges to be considered regarding language access and acquisition. Each state has a federally funded DeafBlind project that
provides resources and technical assistance to support children
identified as DeafBlind. For children who are DeafBlind, many are
advocating for interveners. Interveners are more than interpreters:
they facilitate communication and inclusion and address social and
emotional needs within educational settings.

FAMILY JOURNEY

Each family has a unique narrative to their overall family experience, as
well as a specific pathway to supporting the growth and development of
their D/HH child. Some families experience profound grief around the
loss of an expected parenting story. Many families speak of being overwhelmed initially by an immense amount of information and pressured
to make crucial decisions in a timely manner. Others move into an advocacy model and have their own unique take on the parenting journey. One

FAMILY JOURNEY THEMES

CONSIDERATIONS AND STRATEGIES

Family-­centered decision-­making:
Ensure families are central in decision-­making

Before the visit:
⦁	Physician reflection on their own knowledge, expertise, and biases
At the visit:
⦁	Listen to family concerns actively and address concerns, referring to others when outside
provider expertise is necessary

Families’ need for informed choice

Before the visit:
⦁	Recognize that each family and child are unique and decisions may vary across families
⦁	Recognize that decisions may change over the life span of the child
⦁	Recognize the passion across communication modalities, which drive potential biases in
information and guidance
At the visit:
⦁	Listen actively to understand the family’s values and intended goals and outcomes
⦁	Collaboratively seek information from a variety of reputable sources and discuss potential
biases across various “experts” in the field (see resource list)
⦁	Incorporate the family’s values in an action plan together
⦁	Refer to experts as appropriate

Family-­to-­family support:
Because having a child who is D/HH can feel
isolating and professionals do not carry the
same day-­to-­day experiences, family-­to-­
family connection is an important component
of support

Before the visit:
⦁	Recognize the importance of family-­to-­family support
⦁	Identify resources to link families with other families (see resources)
During the visit:
⦁	Discuss the possible isolation families face
⦁	Determine interest and readiness for family networking
⦁	Share resources that they can rely on when ready to reach out

Access to D/HH adults: To support the family’s
recognition of what success can be and to
provide children with a conceptual framework
for D/HH individuals as adults

Before the visit:
⦁	Recognize families may be experiencing grief over the loss of their child’s expected future
and that experiences with other individuals who are D/HH may be limited or nonexistent
⦁	Identify resources to link families with Deaf adults and Deaf mentoring programs (see Table 55.3)
During the visit:
⦁	Discuss family’s hopes and fears
⦁	Highlight the importance of high expectations for their child
⦁	Discuss ways to promote identity, connection, and independence for their child

Child interactions and supports

Before the visit:
⦁	Recognize the variability and uniqueness of children who are D/HH in terms of capabilities,
skills, and opportunities
At the visit:
⦁	Engage D/HH children directly rather than rely solely on family members for interpreting
communication; for children who use sign language, access to an interpreter is a right under
the Americans with Disabilities Act
⦁	Recognize children’s strengths and resilience
⦁	Ensure children have access to their own health information (at their developmental level)
and have the opportunity for inclusion in decisions as appropriate
⦁	Advocate with children and families to have high expectations for skills, recognizing that
often medical and educational settings use a deficit model (the child must be behind) to
­access supports

simply has to take a look at some of the family stories that are available
in the public realm to appreciate the diversity of the family experience in
raising a D/HH child.
A number of parent support organizations are available to families,
some of which are organized around specific communication philosophies (see Table 55.3).
The pediatrician may be the first medical professional that families
turn to if there is concern about language development and/or hearing.
Although these physician/family relationships are often just as diverse
as the families themselves, some universal concepts start to emerge
when listening to parent stories (Table 55.5). Recognizing these themes

and identifying ways to partner and support families is a critical role of
the medical home.

346 Part IV u Learning and Developmental Disorders

Chapter 56

Developmental Delay and
Intellectual Disability
Meghan E. O’Neill and Bruce K. Shapiro
Intellectual disability (ID) refers to a heterogeneous group of disorders that have in common deficits of adaptive and intellectual function
and an age of onset before maturity is reached. In Europe, the term
learning disability is often used to describe ID.

DEFINITION

Contemporary conceptualizations of ID emphasize adaptive functioning
and social interaction rather than test scores in isolation. The definition
of ID requires significant impairment in general intellectual function
(reasoning, memory, learning, problem solving) and adaptive behavior,
with severity defined by limitations in adaptive functioning or levels of
needed support. This focus encourages the development of individual
treatment plans characterizing the supports needed to enhance functioning. Consistent across these definitions is onset of symptoms before
adulthood (18-­22 years of age). Children with ID have a nonprogressive disorder; loss of developmental milestones or progressive symptoms
with a downward developmental trajectory suggest another disorder.
Significant impairment in adaptive behavior reflects the degree to which
cognitive dysfunction directly contributes to impairments in daily functioning at home, at school and work, and in the community. Adaptive
behavior refers to the skills required for people to function in their everyday lives, and individuals with deficits require more support than same-­age
peers for optimal participation. The American Association on Intellectual
and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-­5) classifications of
adaptive behavior address three broad sets of skills: conceptual, social,
and practical. Conceptual skills include language, reading, writing, time,
number concepts, and self-­direction. Social skills include interpersonal
skills, personal and social responsibility, self-­esteem, gullibility, naiveté,
and ability to follow rules, obey laws, and avoid victimization. Representative practical skills involve performance of activities of daily living (dressing, feeding, toileting/bathing, mobility), instrumental activities of daily
living (e.g., housework, managing money, taking medication, shopping,
preparing meals, using phone and mail systems), occupational skills, and
maintenance of a safe environment. For a deficit in adaptive behavior to be
present, a significant delay in at least one of the three skill areas must be
present. The rationale for requiring only one area is the empirically derived
finding that people with ID can have varying patterns of ability and may
not have deficits in all three areas.
The requirement for adaptive behavior deficits is the most controversial aspect of the diagnostic formulation. The controversy centers on two
broad areas: whether impairments in adaptive behavior are necessary for
the construct of ID and what to measure. The adaptive behavior criterion
may be irrelevant for many children; adaptive behavior is impaired in
virtually all children who have IQ scores <50. The major utility of the
adaptive behavior criterion is to confirm ID in children with IQ scores
in the 60-­75 range, especially considering the historical overdiagnosis
of ID among individuals of color with typical adaptive functioning and
biased IQ testing results. It should be noted that deficits in adaptive
behavior are often found in disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD; see Chapter 58) and attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD; see Chapter 50) in the presence of typical intellectual function,
often mediated by significant difficulties with executive functioning, self-­
directedness, or maladaptive behaviors. In contrast, deficits of adaptive
functioning in ID are primarily attributable to the individual’s overall
cognitive limitations.
The issues of measurement are important as well. The independence
of the three domains of adaptive behavior has not been validated.
The relationship between adaptive behavior and IQ performance is

insufficiently explored. Many adults with IQ scores in the 60-­75 range
do not have significant impairments in practical skills. Adaptive behavior deficits also must be distinguished from maladaptive behavior (e.g.,
aggression, self-­injury, inappropriate sexual behavior).
Significant impairment in general intellectual function refers to performance on an individually administered test of intelligence that is approximately 2 standard deviations (SDs) below the mean. Generally, these tests
provide a standard score that has a mean of 100 and SD of 15 points, so
that IQ scores <70 would meet these criteria. If the standard error of measurement is considered, the upper limits of significantly impaired intellectual function may extend to an IQ of 75. Using a score of 75 to delineate ID
might double the number of children with this diagnosis, but the requirement for impairment of adaptive skills limits the false positives. Children
with ID often show a variable pattern of strengths and weaknesses. Not all
their subtest scores on IQ tests fall into the significantly impaired range.
Onset before age 22 years or adulthood distinguishes dysfunctions
that originate during the developmental period from those that begin
in adulthood. The diagnosis of ID may be made after 22 years of age,
but the cognitive and adaptive dysfunction must have been manifested
before age 22 years. Age of onset may be relevant to qualification for
certain benefits programs that require a diagnosis of ID.
Intellectual disability as nonprogressive. Individuals with ID will
acquire new developmental milestones over time, although at a slower
rate than unaffected children. A slowing trajectory is not uncommon as individuals with ID get older. This should be distinguished
from regression of milestones, which involves true loss of previously
acquired skills and demands additional and often more extensive
etiologic workup. Sometimes regression is seen in the context of the
child’s larger medical picture, such as loss of mobility with increasing
spasticity and contractures in children with comorbid cerebral palsy
(CP) or loss of language skills in the setting of new seizures. Alternatively, regression could suggest a progressive encephalopathy caused
by an inborn error of metabolism or a neurodegenerative disorder (see
Chapters 104 and 639). Prompt identification is essential, as some of
these conditions are treatable or modifiable and some necessitate conversations about future reproductive risk.
Global developmental delay (GDD) is a term often used to describe
young children with delays across multiple domains of development
that have not yet resulted in a diagnosis of ID. In DSM-­5, GDD is a
diagnosis given to children <5 years of age who display significant
delay (>2 SDs) in acquiring early childhood developmental milestones
in two or more domains of development. These domains include receptive and expressive language; gross and fine motor function; cognition,
social and personal development; and activities of daily living. Typically, it is assumed that delay in two domains will be associated with
delay across all domains evaluated, including cognitive and intellectual abilities. Longitudinal studies following outcomes of children with
GDD are sparse but suggest that that upwards of 80% of children with
early global delays continue to experience development challenges
through the school-­age years. However, not all children who meet criteria for a GDD diagnosis at a young age go on to meet criteria for
ID later in childhood. Reasons for the lack of concordance between
GDD and later diagnosis of ID include lower reliability and predictive
validity of developmental testing in children under 5-­6 years of age; a
positive change in developmental trajectory with maturation or possibly with intervention; reclassification to a different disability category
(autism, ADHD, developmental coordination disorder); or imprecise
use of the GDD diagnosis initially. Conversely, in patients with more
severe early delays, the GDD term is often used beyond the point when
the child could be reclassified as having ID, such as when a child has
persistently and markedly low developmental quotients on multiple
assessments and despite intervention during the first few years of life.
It is important to distinguish the medical diagnosis of GDD from the
federal disability classification of “developmental delay” that may be used
by education agencies under the Individuals with Disabilities Education
Act (IDEA). This classification requires that a child have delays in only one
domain of development with subsequent need for special education. Each
state determines its own precise definition and terms of eligibility under
the broader definition outlined by IDEA, and many states use the label for
children up to 9 years of age.

ETIOLOGY

Numerous identified causes of ID may occur prenatally, during delivery, postnatally, or later in childhood. These include infection, trauma,
prematurity, hypoxia-­ischemia, toxic exposures, metabolic dysfunction,
endocrine abnormalities, malnutrition, and genetic abnormalities. Most
people with ID will not have a readily identifiable underlying diagnosis based on prenatal or perinatal history or dysmorphology, meriting
further medical and genetic evaluation. Practice guidelines recommend
that an etiologic workup be pursued in all children with ID or GDD
when there is not a readily apparent explanation for the child’s presentation (Tables 56.1 and 56.2). It is anticipated that these diagnostic guidelines change because genome sequencing studies have identified severe
monogenic etiologies in previously difficult to diagnose developmental
disorders despite extensive previous recommended evaluations.
Among children with milder GDD, yield of etiologic workup will likely
be lower in comparison to children with more significant delays or disability. With increases in etiologic testing among all children with ID
and advancement of technologic capabilities of testing, the number of
identified biologic and genetic causes of ID is continuing to increase rapidly. There are slightly over 100 disorders (all of which are metabolic in
nature) for which treatment may ameliorate the core symptoms of ID (see
https://www.treatable-­id.org/), but these conditions account for a relatively
small percentage of children with ID (Table 56.3). However, there are several reasons beyond disease modification that should prompt providers

to seek etiologic answers in patients with ID. These include insight into
possible associated medical or behavioral comorbidities; information
on prognosis and life expectancy; estimation of recurrence risk for family planning counseling, potential validation, and closure for the family;
increased access to services or specific supports; and better understanding
of underlying pathology with the hope for new treatment options. When
surveyed, families of children with ID with no identified underlying etiology almost universally report that they would want to know of an etiologic
diagnosis if given the choice. Expanded testing will contribute to the growing pathophysiologic understanding of how ID occurs mechanistically and
serves as an opportunity for future targeted treatment opportunities and
clinical trial development.
Mild and more severe forms of ID have different but overlapping risk
factors and etiologies. Nongenetic risk factors that are often associated
with mild ID include low socioeconomic status, low maternal education levels, residence in a developing country, malnutrition, and poor
access to healthcare. The most common biologic causes of, or risk factors for, mild ID include intrauterine growth restriction; prematurity;
perinatal insults; intrauterine exposure to drugs of abuse (including
alcohol); postnatal exposure to neurotoxic substances (including lead);
some sex chromosomal abnormalities; and some genetic syndromes
with multiple, major, or minor congenital anomalies (e.g., 22q11 deletion syndrome, sex chromosomal abnormalities, Noonan syndrome).
Familial clustering is common.

In children with more severe ID, a biologic cause (usually with prenatal onset) can be identified in about three fourths of all cases. Causes
include chromosomal (e.g., Down, Wolf-­Hirschhorn, and deletion 1p36
syndromes) and other genetic and epigenetic disorders (e.g., fragile X,
Rett, and Angelman syndromes), abnormalities of brain development
(e.g., lissencephaly), and inborn errors of metabolism and mitochondrial disorders (e.g., mucopolysaccharidoses, mitochondrial respiratory
chain complex disorders) (Table 56.4). Nonsyndromic severe ID may be
a result of inherited or de novo gene mutations, as well as microdeletions or microduplications. Currently, >1,300 single genes have been
associated with ID. Inherited genetic abnormalities may be mendelian
(autosomal dominant de novo, autosomal recessive, X-­linked) or nonmendelian (imprinting, methylation, mitochondrial defects; see Chapter
97). De novo mutations may also cause other phenotypic features such
as seizures or autism; the presence of these features suggests more pleotropic manifestations of genetic mutations. Consistent with the finding
that disorders altering early embryogenesis are the most common and
severe, the earlier the problem occurs in development, the more severe
its consequences tend to be.

EPIDEMIOLOGY

ID is one of the most common causes of disability in children globally. The prevalence of ID depends on the definition, method of
ascertainment, and population studied, both in terms of geography
and age. According to the statistics of a normal distribution, 2.5%
of the population should have ID (based on IQ alone), and 75%
of these individuals should fall into the mild to moderate range.
Variability in rates across populations likely results from the heavy
influence of external environmental factors and definitional differences on the prevalence of mild ID. The prevalence of severe ID is
relatively stable. Globally, the prevalence of ID has been estimated
to be approximately 16.4 per 1,000 persons in low-­income countries, approximately 15.9/1,000 for middle-­income countries, and
approximately 9.2/1,000 in high-­income countries. A meta-­analysis
of worldwide studies from 1980 to 2009 yielded an overall prevalence of 10.4/1,000. ID occurs more in boys than in girls, at 2:1 in

mild ID and 1.5:1 in severe ID. In part this may be a consequence of
the many X-­linked disorders associated with ID, the most common
being fragile X syndrome (see Chapter 59).
In the United States the prevalence of ID in school-­age children ranges
from 1.1% to 1.8%. There are several reasons why fewer children are identified as having mild ID than predicted from statistics. Professionals might
miss or defer the diagnosis and “give the benefit of the doubt” to the child
and await repeated confirmatory testing over time because it is more challenging to diagnose mild ID than the more severe forms. Other reasons
that contribute to the discrepancy between predicted and observed prevalence are use of instruments that under­identify young children with mild
ID, children diagnosed as having ASD without their ID being recognized
or addressed, misdiagnosis as a language disorder or specific learning disability, and a disinclination to make the diagnosis in minoritized students
because of concern about biased assessments that historically led to overdiagnosis. In some cases, behavioral disorders may divert the focus from
the cognitive dysfunction.
Beyond potential under diagnosis of mild ID, the number of children with mild ID may be decreasing because of public health and education measures to prevent prematurity and provide early intervention
and Head Start programs. However, although the number of school
children who receive services under a federal disability classification of
ID has decreased since 1999, when developmental delay is included in
analysis of the data, the numbers have not changed appreciably.
The prevalence of severe ID has not changed significantly since the 1940s,
accounting for 0.3–0.5% of the population. Many of the causes of severe
ID involve genetic or congenital brain malformations that can neither be
anticipated nor treated at present, though trends toward more expanded
prenatal screening (and subsequent termination) may alter this balance,
as seen with the decreasing incidence of Down syndrome. Additionally,
expanded newborn screening with early treatment has virtually eliminated
ID caused by phenylketonuria and congenital hypothyroidism. However,
continued high prevalence of fetal exposure to alcohol and illicit drugs,
improved survival of very low birthweight premature infants, and increasing overall maternal age during pregnancy (contributing to increased rates
of genetic abnormalities) have counterbalanced this effect.

PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS

The limitations in our knowledge of the neuropathology of ID are demonstrated by the finding that 10–20% of brains of persons with severe
ID appear normal on standard neuropathologic study. Many of the
brains that appear abnormal show only mild, nonspecific changes that
correlate poorly with the degree of ID, including microcephaly, gray
matter heterotopias in the subcortical white matter, unusually regular
columnar arrangement of the cortex, and neurons that are more tightly
packed than usual. Only a minority of the brains show more specific
changes in dendritic and synaptic organization, with dysgenesis of
dendritic spines or cortical pyramidal neurons or impaired growth of
dendritic trees. CNS maturation is defined by genetic, molecular, autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine influences. Receptors, signaling molecules, and genes are critical to brain development.
As the ability to identify genetic aberrations that correspond to
particular phenotypes expands through the use of next-­generation
sequencing, more will be elucidated about the pathogenesis of ID at a
genetic and molecular level. This expanding pathophysiologic knowledge base may serve as a framework with which to develop targeted
therapies to bypass or correct newly identified defects. For example,
use of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors has been shown to rescue
structural and functional neural deficits in mouse models of Kabuki
syndrome, a disorder of histone methylation that leads to variable levels
of ID and characteristic facial features. Similarly, there is growing interest in the role of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor use

preventing seizures, neurodevelopmental disabilities, retinal tumors,
cutaneous tumors, and other manifestations seen in tuberous sclerosis
(see Chapter 636.2).

CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS

Early diagnosis of ID facilitates earlier intervention, identification of
abilities, realistic goal setting, monitoring for potential comorbid conditions, easing of parental anxiety, and greater inclusion of the child
in the community. Children with ID may first come to the pediatrician’s attention because of dysmorphisms (often in infancy), associated
developmental disabilities, or failure to meet age-­appropriate developmental milestones (Tables 56.5 and 56.6). Physical exam findings are
nonspecific, but constellations of dysmorphisms may be consistent
with certain genetic syndromes. With the advent of more sophisticated genetic testing, the limitations of dysmorphology have become
more apparent given the phenotypic variability seen with many genetic
causes of ID.
Most children with ID lag behind peers in their acquisition of developmental skills. In early infancy, failure to meet age-­appropriate expectations can include a lack of visual or auditory responsiveness, unusual
muscle tone (hypotonia or hypertonia), or posture and feeding difficulties. Between 6 and 18 months of age, gross motor delay (lack of sitting, crawling, walking) is the most common concern. Language delay
and behavior problems are common concerns after 18 months of age
(see Table 56.6). For some children with mild ID, the diagnosis remains

With increasing expectations for independence at home and socially,
limitations among those with mild ID become more salient. Older school-­
age children and adolescents with mild ID are typically up to date on
current trends and are conversant as to “who,” “what,” and “where.” It is
not until the “why” and “how” questions are asked that their limitations
become apparent. If allowed to interact at a superficial level, their mild ID
might not be appreciated, even by professionals such as healthcare providers. Because of the stigma associated with ID, adolescents may refer
to themselves as learning disabled, dyslexic, language disordered, or slow
learners. Some people with ID emulate their social milieu to be accepted.
Adolescents with mild ID are both at high risk of being bullied and of
being taken advantage of from a social perspective.

ETIOLOGIC EVALUATION

ID is one of the most frequent reasons for referral to pediatric genetic
providers, with separate but similar etiologic evaluation guidelines
(see Table 56.1). ID is a diagnosis of great clinical heterogeneity, with
only a subset of syndromic etiologies identifiable through classic dysmorphology. If diagnosis is not made after conducting an appropriate

history and physical examination, chromosomal microarray and testing for fragile X syndrome are often the recommended first steps in
the etiologic evaluation of ID. Other testing to consider in the etiologic
evaluation include exome or whole genome sequencing, neuroimaging, metabolic testing, and electroencephalography (Fig. 56.1).
Decisions to pursue an etiologic diagnosis should be based on the
medical and family history, physical examination, and the family’s
wishes. Table 56.7 summarizes clinical practice guidelines and the
yields of testing to assist in decisions about evaluating the child with
GDD or ID. Yield of testing tends to increase with worsening severity
of delays (see also Tables 56.1 and 56.2).
Microarray analysis has replaced a karyotype as first-­tier testing,
given that it discerns abnormalities that are far below the resolution
of a karyotype. Microarray analysis will detect copy number variations but may result in identification of variants of unknown significance or benign variants and therefore should be used in conjunction
with a genetic consultation. Karyotyping has a role when concerns
for trisomy, inversions, balanced insertions, and reciprocal translocations are present. If microarray analysis is not diagnostic, whole
exome sequencing (WES) increases the diagnostic yield in children
with nonsyndromic severe ID, especially when associated conditions
such as autism, epilepsy, or movement disorders are present. WES
will identify nucleotide sequence variants within the coding region of
genes which affect protein function, missing structural and noncoding variants, and trinucleotide repeat disorders. Starting with WES
may be more cost-­effective and may substantially reduce time to diagnosis with higher ultimate yields compared with the traditional diagnostic pathway. Whole genome sequencing, which identifies variants
within both exons and introns, represents the most comprehensive
sequencing option, providing roughly 3,000 times more data than a
microarray. Multimodal genome-wide analysis has identified monogenic etiologies in difficult to diagnose patients when previous testing
did not reveal a diagnosis.
Molecular genetic testing for fragile X syndrome is currently recommended, although a relatively low diagnostic yield has led some to
suggest that this should not be considered a first-­line test for all children with ID or GDD. Yields are highest in males with moderate ID,
unusual physical features, and/or a family history of ID or for females
with more subtle cognitive deficits associated with severe shyness and
a relevant family history, including premature ovarian failure or later-­
onset tremor-­ataxia symptoms (see Chapter 59). For children with a
strong history of X-­linked ID, specific testing of genes or the entire
chromosome may be revealing. Testing for Rett syndrome (methyl
CpG–binding protein 2 [MECP2]) should be considered in females
with moderate to severe disability, though WES may supplant this.

A child with a progressive neurologic disorder, developmental
regression, or acute behavioral changes needs metabolic investigation, as shown in Figure 56.1. Some advocate for metabolic testing to
be done more frequently in children with ID because of the possibility
of detecting a condition that could be treatable (Fig. 56.2, Tables 56.3
and 56.8), though with expanded newborn screening many of these
conditions can be identified at birth. This is most relevant for children
born in countries without widespread newborn screening initiatives,
especially when there is a history of consanguinity. In the absence of
a specific indication, an electroencephalogram (EEG) is typically of
low diagnostic utility and should be reserved for evaluation of clinical
events that may represent seizures or when significant language regression occurs, which may be concerning for Landau-­Kleffner syndrome.
MRI of the brain may provide useful information in directing the care
of a child with microcephaly or macrocephaly, change in head growth
trajectory, asymmetric head shape, new or focal neurologic findings,
or seizures. MRI can detect a significant number of subtle markers
of cerebral dysgenesis in children with ID, but these markers do not
usually suggest a specific etiologic diagnosis, and the risk of anesthesia may outweigh the potential benefits in young children without any
additional concerning signs or symptoms.
Some children with subtle physical or neurologic findings can also
have determinable biologic causes of their ID (see Tables 56.5 and
56.6). How intensively one investigates the cause of a child’s ID is based
on the following factors:
u What is the degree of delay, and what is the age of the child? If milder
or less pervasive delays are present, especially in a younger child,
etiologic yield is likely to be lower.
u 
Is the medical history, family history, or physical exam suggestive

of a specific disorder, increasing the likelihood that a diagnosis will
be made? Are the parents planning on having additional children,
and does the patient have siblings? If so, one may be more likely to
intensively seek disorders for which prenatal diagnosis or a specific
early treatment option is available.
u Is there a potentially treatable disorder?
What are the parents’ wishes? Some parents have little interest in
u 
searching for the cause of the ID, whereas others become so focused
on obtaining a diagnosis that they have difficulty following through
on interventions until a cause has been found. The entire spectrum
of responses must be respected, and supportive guidance should be
provided.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

One of the important roles of pediatricians is the early recognition and diagnosis of cognitive deficits. Developmental surveillance should be multifaceted. Parents’ concerns and observations
about their child’s development should be listened to carefully.
Medical, genetic, and environmental risk factors should be recognized. Infants at high risk (prematurity, maternal substance abuse,
perinatal insult) should be registered in newborn follow-­up programs in which they are evaluated periodically for developmental lags in the first 2 years of life; they should be referred to early
intervention programs as appropriate. Developmental milestones
should be recorded routinely during healthcare maintenance visits.
The American Academy of Pediatricians (AAP) has formulated a
schema for developmental surveillance and screening at 9, 18, 24,
and 30 months of age, including general developmental and autism
screens (see Chapter 28).

Essential to detect and treat; can mask as developmental delay

Gene microarray analysis

A ∼15% yield overall
Better resolution than with karyotype; may identify up to twice as many abnormalities as karyotyping

Pilot studies of whole genome sequencing (WGS) reveal additional yield of about 15%

Neuroimaging

MRI preferred; positive findings increased by abnormalities of skull contour or microcephaly and
macrocephaly or focal neurologic examination (30–40% if indicated, 10–14% if screening)
Identification of specific etiologies is rare; most conditions that are found do not alter the treatment plan;
need to weigh risk of sedation against possible yield

Before making the diagnosis of ID, other disorders that affect cognitive abilities and adaptive behavior should be considered. These include
conditions that mimic ID and others that involve ID as an associated
impairment. Sensory deficits (severe hearing and vision loss), communication disorders, refractory seizure disorders, poorly controlled
mood disorders, or unmanaged severe attention deficits can mimic
ID; certain progressive neurologic disorders can appear as ID before
regression is appreciated. Approximately half of children with cerebral palsy (see Chapter 638.1) and one third of children with autism
spectrum disorder (see Chapter 58) also have ID. Differentiation of
isolated CP from ID relies on motor skills being more affected than
cognitive skills and on the presence of pathologic reflexes and tone
changes. Importantly, cognitive testing may be limited because of
motor and communication impairments in CP such that an accurate

diagnostic assessment often hinges on evaluation by a professional with
experience with this population.
In ASD, social communication and social adaptive skills are more
affected than nonverbal reasoning skills, whereas in ID, there are usually more equivalent deficits in social, fine motor, adaptive, and cognitive skills. The discrepancy between social communication abilities and
overall developmental abilities and the presence, severity, and intensity
of restricted and repetitive behaviors differentiates whether an individual has ID alone or a comorbid diagnosis of ASD. Among toddlers with
ASD, those with lower verbal and nonverbal cognitive test scores in
conjunction with poor adaptive skills have an 85–90% chance of being
classified as having ID in adulthood. However, across all levels of cognition in ASD, there is a significant trend toward much lower adaptive
functioning than would be expected otherwise.

356 Part IV u Learning and Developmental Disorders
DIAGNOSTIC PSYCHOLOGIC TESTING

The formal diagnosis of ID requires the administration of individual
tests of intelligence and adaptive functioning.
The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Fourth Edition
(BSID-­4), the most used infant intelligence test, provides an assessment
of cognitive, language, motor, behavior, social-­emotional, and general
adaptive abilities between 16 days and 42 months of age. The BSID-­4
correlates more strongly with other standardized tests of cognition and
motor development than did prior versions of the test and permits
the differentiation of infants with severe ID from typically developing
infants, but it is less helpful in distinguishing between a typical child
and one with mild ID.
The most used intelligence tests for children older than 3 years
are the Wechsler Scales, although others are also used. The Wechsler
Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Fourth Edition (WPPSI­IV) is used for children with mental ages of 2.5-­7.6 years. The
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fifth Edition (WISC-­V) is
used for children who function above a 6-­year-­old mental age. Both
scales contain numerous subtests in the areas of verbal and performance skills. Although children with ID usually score low on all
subscales, they occasionally score in the average range in one or
more performance areas. Among children who have marked language or verbal limitations, tests like the Differential Ability Scales­II (DAS-­II) or the Leiter International Performance Scale, Third
Edition (Leiter-­3) may be used to optimally capture nonverbal performance skills.
Several normative scales are used in practice to evaluate adaptive
functioning, often through questionnaire or interview formats, with
information being attained from caregivers and educators in multiple different environments when possible (home, school, work).
For example, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS-­3) uses
semi-­structured interviews with parents and caregivers/teachers
to assess adaptive behavior in four domains: communication, daily
living skills, socialization, and motor skills. Other tests of adaptive
behavior include the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System (ABAS-­
3), the Woodcock-­Johnson Scales of Independent Behavior–Revised,
and the AAIDD Diagnostic Adaptive Behavior Scale (DABS). There
is usually (but not always) a good correlation between scores on the
intelligence and adaptive scales in ID. However, it is important to
recognize that adaptive behavior can by influenced by environmentally based opportunities and by family or cultural expectations.
Basic practical adaptive skills (feeding, dressing, hygiene) are more
responsive to remedial efforts than is the IQ score itself. The trajectory of adaptive skill acquisition may not be consistent over time
because of the underlying condition, response to interventions, and
environmental expectations.

COMPLICATIONS AND ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS

Children with ID have higher rates of vision, hearing, neurologic,
orthopedic, and behavioral or emotional disorders than typically
developing children (Table 56.9). These problems are often detected
later in children with ID. If untreated, the associated impairments
may adversely affect the individual’s outcome more than the ID
itself.
The more severe the ID, the greater the number and severity
of associated impairments. Knowing the cause of the ID can help
predict which associated impairments are most likely to occur. For
example, fragile X syndrome (see Chapter 59) and fetal alcohol syndrome (see Chapter 146) are associated with a high rate of behavioral disorders and may be amenable to certain treatments. Children
with fetal alcohol syndrome may have a less robust response to
stimulant use, whereas preliminary data suggest that children with
fragile X syndrome may see behavioral improvements with the use
of metformin. Other genetic conditions may have well-­established
medical comorbidities that should be screened for throughout the
life span. For example, Down syndrome (see Chapter 57) has many

medical complications (hypothyroidism, hearing and vision impairments, obstructive sleep apnea, congenital heart disease, atlantoaxial subluxation). Such associated impairments can require ongoing
physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech-­language therapy,
behavioral therapy, adaptive and mobility equipment, glasses, hearing aids, and medication or other medical management. Failure to
identify and treat these impairments can hinder successful habilitation and result in difficulties in the school, home, and neighborhood environment.
Special attention should be given to screening for accidental injury,
neglect, and abuse. Children with ID have a greater risk of preventable death from accidental injury. They are more likely to be victims of
frequent, continual abuse at the hands of multiple abusers and are more
frequently abused by unrelated or unfamiliar perpetrators compared to
typically developing peers. Up to 15–30% of children with ID are victims
of sexual abuse, with female teens with ID being at highest risk. Abuse may
precipitate the onset of maladaptive behaviors and changes in mood. As
such, a high index of suspicion must be maintained, with the knowledge
that even individuals with severe ID may be able to reliably disclose victimization and abuse.

PREVENTION

Examples of primary programs to prevent ID include the following:
u Increasing the public’s awareness of the adverse effects of alcohol and other drugs of abuse on the fetus (the most common
preventable cause of ID in the Western world is fetal alcohol exposure).
u Encouraging safe sexual practices, preventing teen pregnancy, and
promoting early prenatal care with a focus on preventive programs
to limit transmission of diseases that may cause congenital infection
(syphilis, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, HIV).
u Preventing traumatic injury by encouraging the use of safety technologies (car seats, window locks, helmets, gun locks).
u Preventing poisonings by teaching parents about securing medications and potential poisons.

Implementing immunization programs to reduce the risk of ID
caused by encephalitis, meningitis, and congenital infection.
Presymptomatic detection of certain disorders can result in
treatment that prevents adverse consequences. State newborn
screening by tandem mass spectrometry (now detecting >60 rare
genetic disorders in most states), newborn hearing screening, and
preschool lead poisoning prevention programs are examples. Additionally, screening for comorbid conditions can help to limit the
extent of disability and maximize the level of functioning in certain populations. Annual thyroid, vision, and hearing screening in a
child with Down syndrome is an example of presymptomatic testing
in a disorder associated with ID.

TREATMENT

Although the core symptoms of ID can be prevented in some conditions, they are generally not treatable once ID is diagnosed. Many
associated impairments are amenable to intervention and therefore
benefit from early identification. Most children with an ID do not
have a behavioral or emotional disorder as an associated impairment, but challenging behaviors (aggression, self-­injury, oppositional defiant behavior) and internalizing disorders (mood and
anxiety disorders) occur with greater frequency in this population
than among children with typical intelligence. These behavioral and
emotional disorders are the primary cause for out-­of-­home placements, increased family stress, reduced employment prospects, and
decreased opportunities for social inclusion. Some behavioral and
emotional disorders are difficult to diagnose in children with more
severe ID because of the child’s limited abilities to understand, communicate, interpret, or generalize. Other disorders are masked by
the ID. The detection of ADHD (see Chapter 50) in the presence
of moderate to severe ID may be difficult, as may be discerning a
thought disorder (psychosis) in someone with autism and ID.
Behavioral disorders in ID often result from a mismatch between
the child’s abilities and the demands of the situation, organic
problems, and family difficulties. These behaviors may represent
attempts by the child to communicate, gain attention, gain access
to desired tangibles, escape certain demands, exert control, or avoid
frustration. Determining the antecedents, functions, and consequences of behavior can help in developing an effective behavior
intervention plan. The most formal iteration of this is a functional
behavioral assessment carried out by a well-­trained behavior analyst. In assessing the challenging behavior, one must also consider
whether it is inappropriate for the child’s mental or developmental
age, rather than the chronological age. However, if the behavior is
dangerous to the individual or the external world, intervention is
required regardless of whether it is “appropriate” for their developmental age. When intervention is needed, an environmental change,
such as a more appropriate classroom setting, may improve certain
behavior problems. Behavior management techniques and parent
training are valuable; psychopharmacologic agents may be appropriate in certain situations, such as aggression or self-­injurious
behaviors with high levels of intensity and frequency.
No medication has been found that improves the core symptoms
of ID. However, several agents are being tested in specific disorders with known biologic mechanisms (e.g., mTOR inhibitors in
tuberous sclerosis and PTEN disorder), with the hope for future
pharmacologic options that could alter the natural course of cognitive impairment seen in patients with these disorders. Medication
is most useful in the treatment of associated behavioral and psychiatric disorders that do not respond to initial behavioral approaches
and environmental manipulation. Additionally, underlying medical
disorders and abuse/neglect should be considered as part of the differential before medication initiation in patients with self-­injury,
aggression, irritability, or significant disruptive behaviors.
Medications used among individuals with ID generally target specific associated symptom complexes, including inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity (stimulant medications and alpha-­agonists);
self-­
injurious behavior and aggression (antipsychotics); anxiety,
obsessive-­compulsive disorder, and depression (selective serotonin

357

reuptake inhibitors); and sleep-­
related dysfunction (melatonin,
alpha-­agonists, gabapentin, trazodone). Even if a medication proves
successful, its use should be reevaluated at least yearly to assess the
need for continued treatment of the target behaviors and improvements in functional goals. Generally, medications should be started
at a low dose and increased slowly, with frequent assessments of
whether benefits outweigh any adverse effects. Adverse effects and
idiosyncratic responses to medications may be more common in this
population.

PRIMARY CARE, SUPPORTIVE CARE, AND
MANAGEMENT

Each child with ID needs a medical home with a primary care clinician who is readily accessible to the family to answer questions,
help coordinate care, and discuss concerns. Healthcare clinicians
can have effects on patients and their families that are still felt
decades later. The role of primary care includes involvement in
prevention efforts, early diagnosis, identification and management
of associated deficits, longitudinal developmental surveillance
and screening, referral for appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic services, interdisciplinary management, provision of anticipatory guidance (see Chapter 13), and advocacy for the child and
family. The management strategies for children with an ID should
be multimodal, with efforts directed at all aspects of the child’s
life: health, education, social and recreational activities, behavior
problems, and associated impairments. Support for parents and
siblings should also be provided (Table 56.10). A strengths-­based
approach focusing on optimizing participation in all aspects of life
tends to be more beneficial than an exclusive focus on cognitive
or academic skill attainment. Goals of overall care should include
maximizing the individual’s independent functioning, identifying effective communication strategies, preserving and enhancing
physical fitness and well-­b eing, supporting positive relationship
building, and ensuring opportunities for the individual to participate fully in the community and find purpose and enjoyment in
life activities. Goals should be individualized, flexible, appropriate,
and attainable.
The AAP has published a series of guidelines and/or toolkits for
health supervision of children with specific disorders associated with
ID (Down syndrome, fragile X syndrome, Williams syndrome, fetal
alcohol spectrum disorder). Another source for disorder-­specific
information can be found at https://www.medicalhomeportal.org/d
iagnoses-­and-­conditions.
Goals should be considered and programs adjusted as needed
during the primary care visit. Decisions should also be made about
what additional information is required for future planning or to
explain why the child is not meeting expectations. Other evaluations, such as formal neuropsychologic or educational testing, can
be helpful for diagnostic clarification, attaining more appropriate
school-­based supports, understanding strengths and challenges, or
assisting with the process of transition at various time points.

Interdisciplinary Management

The primary care clinician has the responsibility for consulting with
other disciplines to make the diagnosis of ID and coordinate treatment services. Consultant services may include speech-­language
pathology, physical therapy, occupational therapy, psychology, audiology, nutrition, nursing, and social work, as well as medical specialties such as neurodevelopmental disabilities, neurology, genetics,
physical medicine and rehabilitation, psychiatry, developmental-­
behavioral pediatrics, and surgical specialties. Contact with early
intervention and school personnel is equally important to help prepare and assess the adequacy of the child’s individual family service
plan or individual education plan. The family should be an integral
part of the planning and direction of this process. Care should be
family centered and culturally sensitive; for older children, their
participation in planning and decision-­making should be promoted
to whatever extent possible. Goal setting should be appropriate,
individualized, and achievable

Association. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed. Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association.

Periodic Reevaluation

The child’s abilities and the family’s needs change over time. As the
child grows, more information must be provided to the child and
family, goals must be reassessed, and programming needs should be
adjusted. A periodic review should include information about the
child’s health status and the child’s functioning at home, at school, and
in other community settings. Other information, such as psychologic
or educational testing, may be helpful. Reevaluation should be undertaken at routine intervals (every 6-­12 months during early childhood),
at any time the child is not meeting expectations, or when the child is
moving from one service delivery system to another. This is especially
true during the transition to adulthood, beginning at age 16, as mandated by the IDEA Amendments of 2004, and lasting through age 21,
when care should be transitioned to adult-­based systems and providers
(see Chapter 152).

Federal and Education Services

Education is the single most important discipline involved in the
treatment of children with an ID. In the United States, the IDEA,
Part B, mandates a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in
the least restrictive environment (LRE) for all school-­age children
(3-­21 years of age). Additionally, Part C mandates early intervention services from birth through 36 months of age to be delivered in
a natural environment (usually home) for all qualifying infants and
toddlers. The developmental and educational program for children
with GDD or ID must be relevant to the child’s unique needs and
address the child’s individual strengths and challenges. The child’s

developmental level, requirements for support, and goals for independence provide a basis for early intervention services to establish
an individualized family service plan (IFSP), which focuses on
the family’s needs to help them optimize the development of their
child. For children over 36 months of age, the school system develops an individualized education program (IEP), which focuses
on the child’s educational needs. Inclusive education seeks to support the right of every child, regardless of ability, to participate in a
broad range of activities and contexts as full members of families,
communities, and societies with an effort to maximize access, participation, and supports. Research on inclusion reveals benefits for
individuals with disabilities and for typically developing children.
As such, to the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities should be educated with children who do not have disabilities. In general, removal from the regular educational environment
should occur only when the nature or severity of the child’s disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily, not
simply because significant curriculum modifications are needed.
Children who are educated in more inclusive settings, regardless
of overall developmental level, tend to have higher rates of community participation as adults. Behavioral challenges are the most
limiting factor in terms of full inclusion, both in school and within
the community, emphasizing the importance of implementing early
and consistent behavior management strategies.
Beyond education services, families of children with ID often
are eligible for federal or state-­provided social services. All states
offer developmental disabilities programs that provide home and

community-­based services to eligible children and adults, potentially including in-­home supports, care coordination services, residential living arrangements, vocational and employment support
programs, and additional therapeutic options. A variety of Medicaid waiver programs are also offered for children with disabilities
within each state. Children with ID who live in low-­income-­status
households can qualify to receive supplemental security income
(SSI), but many of these families do not receive the benefits to
which they are eligible.

Leisure and Recreational Activities

The child’s social and recreational needs should be addressed.
Although young children with ID are generally included in play
activities with children who have typical development, adolescents
with ID often do not have opportunities for enriching social interactions. Community participation among adults with ID is much
lower than that of the typical population even though these individuals tend to have the same preferences and wishes for leisure
activities as their nondisabled peers. Individuals with ID experience
high rates of marginalization, especially from involvement in formal recreational programs, often because of insufficient resources
to accommodate participation, difficulties with expenses and transportation, and so forth. To reduce isolation, ideas for inclusion in
leisure activities should be explored with families, including church
group involvement, Boy and Girl Scout chapters, 4H clubs, local
park district programs, and musical opportunities like choir and
instrumental lessons. Participation in sports should be encouraged
(even if the child is not competitive) because it offers many benefits, including weight management, development of physical coordination, maintenance of cardiovascular fitness, and improvement
of self-­image. Inclusion in class trips, dances, dating, and other
social events should be encouraged. International programs such
as Special Olympics and Best Buddies International seek to enhance
inclusion and visibility of individuals with disabilities and can be a
valuable resource.

Family Counseling

Many families adapt well to having a child with ID, but some have
emotional or social difficulties. The risks of parental depression and
child abuse and neglect are higher in this group of children than in the
general population. The factors associated with good family coping
and parenting skills include stability of the marriage, good parental
self-­esteem, limited number of siblings, higher socioeconomic status, lower degree of disability or associated impairments (especially
behavioral), parents’ appropriate expectations and acceptance of the
diagnosis, supportive extended family members, and availability of
community programs and respite care services. In families in whom
the emotional burden of having a child with ID is great, family counseling, parent support groups, sibling support groups and camps,
respite care, and home health services should be an integral part of
the treatment plan.

Transition to Adulthood

The transition to adulthood can present a stressful and chaotic time for
the adolescent with ID and their family (see Chapter 152). A successful
transition correlates with better quality of life but requires significant
advanced planning. The transition process for those with ID extends
beyond medical care and needs to include education and employment,
health and well-­being, finances and independence, and social and
community life. Specific issues include:
u Decision-­making (supported decision-­making, guardianship, power
of attorney)
u Accessing and securing social benefits for which the person is eligible (e.g., SSI, Medicaid)
The choice of living arrangements and necessary supports (indeu 

361

pendent living, shared living arrangements, or living with parents;
community-­integrated living arrangements; group homes)
u Estate planning for the parents (ABLE accounts, special needs trust)
u 
Postsecondary training (vocational choices, postsecondary education – pacer.org)
u Community participation and involvement in leisure activities (e.g.,
community service and volunteering activities, religious groups,
Special Olympics, Best Buddies, local clubs)
Successful transition is difficult to achieve because of policies, systems, and services that are not comprehensive or coordinated. In
moving from child to adult care, families tend to find that services are
less readily available, more fragmented, and more difficult to navigate
across multiple agencies and jurisdictions.
Transition planning is a required element of the IEP process by
age 16 years, and options for continued education or entry into the
workforce after high school should be thoroughly considered, with the
greater goal of ultimate community-­based employment. Postsecondary education possibilities might involve community college or vocational training. In 2008, the U.S. Higher Education Opportunity Act
(HEOA) granted students with ID access to federal financial aid to
attend colleges with Comprehensive Transition Programs (CTPs),
which are designed for postsecondary students with ID to continue
academic, career and technical, and independent living instruction
to prepare for employment. As of 2019, more than 265 nondegree
postsecondary programs for students with ID exist nationwide in the
United States.
Although employment is a critical element of life adaptation for
persons with ID, only 15% are estimated to have jobs, with significant
gaps in pay and compensation compared to workers without disability. Employment selection should be “customized” to the individual’s
interests and abilities. Options may include participation in competitive employment, supported employment, high school–to–work
transition programs, job-­coaching programs, and consumer-­directed
voucher programs.

Self-­Advocacy

The self-­advocacy movement represents an important effort by persons with ID and other disabilities to advocate for maximal autonomy
and self-­determination in all aspects of life. This movement is a part
of the greater disabilities rights movement and represents a resistance
to historical systemic injustices experienced by individuals with ID,
including neglect, abuse, nonautonomy, marginalization, incarceration, sterilization, and isolation. Self-­advocacy stresses that individuals
with ID should be able to speak for themselves, should be involved
maximally in decision-­making, should be treated as equal and fully
included in society, and should be given as much control over their
own self-­direction as possible. This movement emphasizes the tenet
of “nothing about us without us” and has led to nationwide changes
in terms of policy and medical and legal nomenclature. Above all, the
self-­advocacy movement has sought to redefine the approach to disability, moving toward a social model of acceptance, equality, accommodation, and inclusion, putting the onus on society to change its
attitudes and practices rather than calling on the individual with ID
to change.

OUTCOMES

In children with severe ID or ID requiring significant supports, the
prognosis is often evident by early childhood. Mild ID might not
always be a lifelong disorder. Children might meet criteria for GDD
at an early age, but later the disability can evolve into a more specific
developmental disorder (language disorder, autism, ADHD, specific
learning disability, or borderline intelligence). Others with a diagnosis of mild ID during their school years may develop sufficient adaptive behavior skills that they no longer fit the diagnosis as adolescents
or young adults, or the effects of maturation and plasticity may result
in children moving from one diagnostic category to another (from

moderate to mild ID). Conversely, some children who have a diagnosis
of a specific learning disability or communication disorder might not
maintain their rate of cognitive growth and may fall into the range of
ID over time.
The apparent higher prevalence of ID in low-­and middle-­income
countries is of concern, given the limitations in available resources.
Community-­based rehabilitation (CBR) is an effort promoted by
the World Health Organization (WHO) over the past 4 decades as a
means of making use of existing community resources for persons
with disabilities in low-­income countries, with the goal of increasing inclusion and participation within the community. CBR is now
being implemented in >90 countries, although the efficacy of such
programs has not been established.
The long-­term outcome of persons with ID depends on the underlying cause; degree of cognitive and adaptive deficits; presence of associated medical, developmental, and behavioral impairments; capabilities
of the families and schools; and availability of community supports,
services, and training provided to the child and family (see Table
56.10). As adults, many persons with mild ID can gain economic and
social independence with functional literacy, but they may need periodic support or supervision (especially when under social, economic,
or health-­related stress). Most live successfully in the community,
either independently or in supervised settings. Many will marry, some
will have children, and meaningful and long-­lasting relationships can
be expected.
For persons with moderate ID, the goals of education are to
enhance adaptive abilities and “survival” academic and vocational
skills, so they are better able to live and function in the adult world
(Table 56.11). The concept of supported employment has been very
beneficial to these individuals; the person is trained by a coach to
do a specific job in the setting where the person is to work, bypassing the need for a “sheltered workshop” experience and resulting
in successful work adaptation in the community and meaningful
inclusion. These persons generally live at home with family or in
a supervised setting in the community, such as a community integrated living arrangement (CILA) where different levels of supervision and support are provided depending on the needs of the
individuals. There has been a strong movement away from institutionalized living, defined as residence in a facility of four or more
people who did not choose to live together.
As adults, people with severe to profound ID usually require extensive to pervasive supports (see Table 56.11). These individuals often
have associated impairments, such as CP, behavioral disorders, epilepsy, or sensory impairments, that further limit their adaptive functioning. They can perform simple tasks in supervised settings. Most
people with this level of ID can live in the community with appropriate supports, though some may require a higher level of “institutional
care” that is best provided though smaller community-­run group
home settings.
The life expectancy of people with mild ID is similar to the general population, with a mean age at death in the early 70s. However,
persons with severe and profound ID have a decreased life expectancy at all ages, presumably from associated serious neurologic or
medical disorders, with a mean age at death in the mid-­50s. Given
that persons with ID are living longer and have high rates of comorbid health conditions in adulthood (e.g., obesity, hypertension, diabetes), ID is now one of the costliest ICD-­10 diagnoses, with an
average lifetime cost of 1-­2 million dollars per person. Thus the priorities for pediatric primary care are to improve healthcare delivery
systems during childhood; facilitate the transition of care to adult
providers; and ensure high-­quality, integrated, community-­based
services for all persons with ID.

PRINCIPLES OF CARING FOR CHILDREN WITH
COMPLEX GENETIC DISORDERS

Down syndrome (trisomy 21) is the most common genetic cause
of intellectual disability, with an incidence of 1 in 700 live births
in the United States. Many of the principles of care for individuals
with Down syndrome generalize to other complex genetic disorders. Genetic disorders generally affect all cells in the body, and
hence tend to be multisystemic disorders. Trisomy 21’s multisystem
effects require monitoring of all organ systems for potential related
issues.
Chromosome 21 is the smallest human autosome, which likely
accounts for the relatively high fetal survival rate in trisomy 21. The
clinical manifestations of other trisomies and aneuploidies are shown
in Tables 57.1 and 57.2 and Figs. 57.1, 57.2, and 57.3. Fetuses with other

full autosomal trisomies are not always viable, but partial trisomy and
quatrosomy (trisomy or quatrisomy of only part of the chromosome)
or mosaic trisomy (only part of the cell lines contain the aneuploidy)
can be viable.
The Down syndrome phenotype can occur as a result of full trisomy
21 (95%), partial trisomy 21 (part of the 21st chromosome in triplicate), mosaic trisomy 21, or translocation. Maternal nondisjunction
in meiosis is the most common cause of trisomy 21. Paternal origin
accounts for less than 10%.
Chromosome abnormalities affect not only the product and function of that particular group of genes but can have upstream and downstream effects on other gene products in linked pathways. The over 314
triplicate genes in Down syndrome are known to affect the products
and metabolic activity of genes from every other chromosome. Possible phenotype (condition) gene relationships in trisomy 21 are noted
in Figure 57.4.
The link between children’s physical health, development, and
behavior becomes obvious when caring for children with complex
genetic disorders. Children with developmental disabilities often
cannot adequately communicate the symptoms of illness. Challenging behaviors can also interfere with adequate assessment and intervention. Too often, sources of distress, developmental challenges,
and behavioral issues are attributed to the genetic disorder and
dismissed by family, medical, and educational caregivers. Providing care for genetically complex children requires health and other
providers to consider a range of potential differential diagnoses
when presented with a change in behavior, a plateau or regression
in development, or a new physical complaint.
Trisomy 21 affects brain development across the life span, leading
to differences in brain anatomy, neurotransmission, and connectivity that affect processing, glial cell function, infrastructure support, energy metabolism, and in adults, the formation of amyloid
plaques leading to high risk for early Alzheimer disease. Alterations
in brain development and functioning affect learning, behavior, and
emotions, leading to an increased incidence of neurobehavioral and
psychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs),
attention-­
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorders, and depression.
It is important for the clinician to understand that children with
genetic disorders are genetically more closely related to their biologic family than they are to other children with similar disorders.
Children with Down syndrome will have similar patterns of familial
heritability for heritable traits and medical conditions as their biologic siblings. Individuals with genetic disorders need to be seen as
children/persons first who happen to have a genetic disorder. Using
person-­
first language (child with Down syndrome, not Downs
child) helps everyone focus on this principle.

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS

Children with Down syndrome are at increased risk for a variety of
congenital anomalies and comorbid medical conditions. Typically, they
have a characteristic facial appearance and other physical characteristics that allow clinical recognition of trisomy 21 in the newborn period
(Figs. 57.5 and 57.6 and Table 57.3).
The increased risk for a variety of medical conditions continues
throughout the life span (Table 57.4). The American Academy of
Pediatrics (AAP) has developed Down Syndrome Health Supervision Guidelines for clinicians caring for children with trisomy 21
(Table 57.5). Individuals with Down syndrome often have significant communication deficits, which can result in difficulty reporting pain and discomfort; clinicians need to pay attention to the
caregiver’s observation of changes in behavior when evaluating the
level of pain or illness. Paying close attention to subtle cues on exam

and asking direct questions about specific areas of pain or discomfort can be helpful (e.g., “Does your throat hurt?” while pointing to
or touching their throat).

Ophthalmology

The red reflex should be evaluated in the newborn period with a
thorough ophthalmologic exam in the first 6 months of life and then
annually until age 5, then every 2-­3 years thereafter. Children with
DS are at higher risk for cataracts, glaucoma, nystagmus, strabismus,
astigmatism, refractive error, accommodative error, blepharitis, and
keratoconus. Visual acuity and visual processing are foundational for
development.

Ear, Nose, and Throat

The pinna and external ear canals are often small with a predisposition to cerumen impaction. Middle ear effusion occurs in the majority of children, starting in infancy, and may require referral to an ear/
nose/throat (ENT) specialist for better visualization because of stenotic ear canals. Chronic nasal congestion, choanal atresia, adeno/
tonsillar hypertrophy, laryngo/tracheomalacia, subglottic stenosis,

and laryngeal cleft all can affect feeding and breathing, including contributing to sleep apnea. Most children with DS require regular ENT
follow-­up.
Many children with DS have some degree of hearing loss (HL). Most
commonly this is conductive HL associated with middle ear effusion.
Smaller numbers have mixed or sensorineural HL. Hearing is foundational for speech development. Hearing should be screened in the newborn period and with audiologic assessment between 6 and 9 months
and every 6 months thereafter until an accurate ear-­specific audiologic
evaluation is obtained, then annually. Hearing assessment through
auditory brainstem responses (requiring sedation) may be needed if
audiologic evaluation is inconclusive. Lack of parental concern about
hearing should not preclude obtaining audiologic assessment. Aggressive treatment of otitis media and middle ear effusion reduces the frequency of hearing loss.

Dental

Children with DS often have delayed tooth eruption, malformed
teeth, microdontia, permanent tooth agenesis, tooth impaction,
malocclusion, and supernumerary teeth. Periodontal disease is

Chapter 57 u Down Syndrome and Other Abnormalities of Chromosome Number
seen in the majority of individuals with DS. Starting oral health preventive programs young, close supervision and support of dental
hygiene and chemical adjuvants improve outcomes. Children with
DS should first see a pediatric dentist at age 1 year and follow up
at least every 6 months. For children who do not tolerate dental
examinations or procedures, sedated examinations may be necessary, preferably in a hospital with anesthesiologists familiar with
caring for patients with DS.

Endocrine

Children with DS are at risk for congenital and acquired hypothyroidism (HT) and hyperthyroidism (Graves disease [GD]). Thyroid testing should be done at birth as part of newborn screening.
Acquired HT and GD are autoimmune disorders with elevated
thyroid antibodies. Thyroid-­stimulating hormone (TSH) testing
can detect both HT and hyperthyroidism and should be checked
by 6 months, at 1 year, and then annually thereafter. Most cases of
thyroid disorders are asymptomatic and would be missed without
screening. Compensated HT refers to mild elevations in TSH with
normal T4, requiring continued monitoring. Low TSH can indicate Graves disease. Children with DS who have GD can develop
HT, and those with HT can develop GD. Thyroid disorder should
be considered as part of the differential diagnoses with mood or
behavior changes, slowing of growth, exophthalmos, high blood
pressure, or tachycardia.
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) is more common in children with DS.
Screening for type 2 DM, especially in obese individuals, should follow
similar guidelines to the typically developing (TD) population.

Cardiac

Congenital heart disease (CHD) affects about half of all children
with DS, including atrioventricular (AV) canal defects, atrial septal
defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), tetralogy of Fallot
(TOF), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and patent foramen ovale
(PFO). All children with DS should have an infant echocardiogram
even with a normal physical examination. Cardiology follow-­up
will be based on echocardiogram findings. Signs of heart failure
such as failure to thrive, tachypnea, easy fatigue, or sweating with
feeds require expedited referral back to cardiology. Pulmonary
hypertension can also occur in children with DS related to congenital heart defects or to respiratory illness. Later in adolescence and
adulthood, clinicians should be aware of the increased risk for valvular heart disease and endocarditis.

Pulmonary

Respiratory infections are the most common cause for hospital
admission of children with DS without CHD and are a common
cause of mortality in children with CHD. Respiratory compromise
may present with subtle signs of respiratory distress such as tachypnea, intercostal retraction, shortness of breath, and easy fatigue
with exertion. The lack of overt distress may lead clinicians to
underestimate the level of respiratory compromise. Both anatomy
and immunodeficiency associated with DS can lead to increased
risk for upper and lower respiratory infections. Macro and micro
pulmonary structural anomalies have been reported. Gastroesophageal reflux disease, swallowing dysfunction, and upper airway differences (including transesophageal [TE] fistula) increase the risk
of aspiration.

Sleep

The estimated prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) ranges
from 31% to 79%, and onset occurs from infancy through adulthood. A sleep study before the age of 4 years is recommended.
Clinicians should consider ordering a sleep study at any age, with
chronic signs of respiratory compromise when awake or asleep or
daytime symptoms of nonrestorative sleep. There is some evidence
that OSA causes difficulties in cognitive, behavioral, and adaptive

369

functioning in children with DS. Obesity increases the risks for
OSA in many children with DS.

Neurology

Children with DS ages 6-­18 months are at increased risk for infantile spasms (IS). The outcome is often better with treatment than the
non–DS population with ID but is variable, ranging from no obvious
sequelae to ongoing seizure disorders, ASD, and more severe intellectual disability. In addition to the classic signs of IS, change in mental
status in an infant or toddler or a plateau or regression in development
should lead to prompt neurologic evaluation, including an electroencephalogram (EEG). Children with trisomy 21 are at increased risk for
other seizure disorders. There is an increased risk for strokes possibly
related to CHD, vascular malformations (including moyamoya syndrome), and other risk factors.

Gastrointestinal

Most children with DS have structural or functional gastrointestinal (GI) comorbidities, many of which can affect individuals across
the life span. There is evidence of abnormalities in enteric nerves
affecting microanatomy and nerve function. Congenital anomalies
include esophageal atresia, TE fistula and duodenal atresia, stenosis, and webs, Hirschsprung disease, and anorectal malformations.
Constipation and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are frequent causes of irritability, GI discomfort, feeding issues, toileting
refusal, and incontinence. There appears to be a strong association
between GERD, pneumonia, and OSA. Children with DS are also at
higher risk of celiac disease, which can cause GI, nutritional, and
behavioral issues. The AAP guidelines do not recommend routine
celiac screening, but rather to maintain a high index of suspicion
with GI complaints, growth faltering, or behavioral concerns. Many
others, however, have performed routine screening because many
patients with DS who have celiac disease are asymptomatic; there
may be a lag of 2-­3 years before symptoms appear.

Nutrition/Obesity

In infancy and early childhood, dysphagia, GI conditions, cardiac,
and respiratory complications may cause failure to thrive. Weight
faltering can continue for older children because of the same issues
but may be more intermittent. Because of the high rates of dysphagia in infants with DS, video swallow studies should be considered
when there is any sign of weight faltering, aspiration, feeding difficulties, or recurrent respiratory infections. Thickened formulas,
low-­f low bottles/nipples, or slower paced feeding may be required.
Nasogastric (NG) or gastric tube (GT) supplementation to assure
adequate nutrition may be needed. Many babies with DS can successfully breastfeed, and clinicians need to be encouraging but
watchful for growth faltering.
Obesity becomes more prominent in early childhood and extending into adulthood. In school-age children with DS, those at 50% or
greater on DS-specific BMI charts are in the obese range. Thus to
gauge the level of overweight for children with DS, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) curves for BMI should be
used. When children with DS gain more autonomy in feeding, overeating can become a problem. Many do not appear to satiate and will
continue to eat as long as food is presented or will seek food. Caregivers therefore cannot rely on the child’s satiety to determine caloric
sufficiency. Decreased basal metabolic rates (reduced caloric needs)
and lower physical activity can also contribute to obesity. Anticipatory guidance regarding healthy nutritional practices, meal and snack
limits, and active lifestyle choices should be part of well-­child visits
from a young age.

asymptomatic renal pelvic dilatation, kidney ectopia, proteinuria
and hematuria, immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy, and focal
segmental glomerulosclerosis, occur more frequently than in the
general population. There are no current guidelines for regular surveillance, but clinicians need to maintain a high index of suspicion.

Sexuality and Reproductive Health

Males and females with DS undergo puberty at similar ages to peers. In
males, after puberty, testicular volume decreases and gonadal dysfunction worsens with age. Males are infertile, with few exceptions. Females

with DS are fertile, having a 33% chance of having a child with DS.
Menstrual problems, including irregular periods, and premenstrual
irritability are common reasons for use of oral contraceptives. Most
females manage menstrual periods well, but there may be difficulties
with hygiene. Menopause tends to occur early.
Individuals with DS are at increased risk for sexual abuse, and caregivers should discuss appropriate and inappropriate contact and relationships from an early age. Sexuality education should be included in
their educational curriculum. Clinicians should discuss sexuality, birth
control, and reproductive issues at health maintenance visits.

Chapter 57 u Down Syndrome and Other Abnormalities of Chromosome Number
Hematology-­Oncology

AAP guidelines recommend a complete blood cell count (CBC)
with differential for all newborns with DS. Neonates with DS commonly have hematologic abnormalities, including peripheral blasts,
neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, or polycythemia. Five to ten percent of neonates with DS have transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) (also called transient abnormal myelopoiesis [TAM]),
which is associated with pathologic variants in GATA1. Typically,
this resolves spontaneously within the first 1-­3 months of life, but
10–20% will develop acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL) in
the first 4 years of life. AMKL is sensitive to treatment in most cases
and has a good prognosis.
Children with DS are ∼20 times more likely to get acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (1 in 900-­1,000) than the typical population, which
is associated with pathologic variants in JAK2. Treatment trials show
lower response rates, higher recurrence rate, and higher treatment-­
related mortality.
Annual hemoglobin screening for anemia is recommended throughout childhood with additional testing for ferritin and C-­reactive protein
(CRP) when iron deficiency is suspected. The incidence of anemia in
DS may be similar or increased compared with the general population.
Other common CBC findings include macrocytosis, low white blood
cell (WBC) count, and polycythemia, the clinical significance of which
is unknown.

Immunology/Allergy

Individuals with DS are more susceptible to infections because of mild
to moderate T-­and B-­cell lymphopenia, with a decrease in naive lymphocytes, impaired mitogen-­induced T-­cell proliferation, reduced specific antibody responses to immunizations, and defects of neutrophil
chemotaxis. Nonimmunologic anatomic factors also contribute to the
increased risk of respiratory infections. Children with DS with significant numbers of serious infections or difficulty clearing infections need
further immunologic evaluation.
Autoimmune disorders are also more common, including thyroid
disorders, celiac disease, alopecia areata, vitiligo, type 1 DM, juvenile
idiopathic arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

Musculoskeletal

Individuals with DS have short stature across the life span and
stop growing sooner than typical peers, the mechanism of which is
unclear. Growth hormone is rarely deficient. Ligamentous laxity is
common, especially in the ankles and feet. Inflammatory arthritis
is underrecognized, and scoliosis is more common. Joint instability is most apparent in the neck (atlantoaxial instability [AAI]),
hips, and knees. Joint pain and impaired mobility can contribute to
motor skills deficits, impede independence, and add to behavioral
difficulties.
Radiographic screening for AAI is not recommended because flexion/extension neck x-­rays are not predictive for future neurologic
risk. Signs and symptoms of AAI occur because of compression of the
spinal cord from slippage of the C1 or C2 vertebrae, which can occur
after an injury or anesthesia but can also be seen spontaneously. Neck
pain, stiffness, and/or myelopathic signs and symptoms (e.g., change
in gait, bowel, or bladder pattern or weakness) should prompt referral to orthopedics or neurosurgery. Universal neck precautions are
recommended for all children with DS, assuming that all are at risk
for injury from AAI, including limited participation in any activities
that would be associated with forcible neck movement such as contact
sports, diving, and universal cervical precautions with intubation procedures/surgery. Children with DS should be secured in rear-­facing car
seats until 40 pounds and may need harness-­style car restraints over
40 pounds.
Hip instability resulting in recurrent (often painless and voluntary)
hip dislocation and patellar instability can impair ambulation and may
require surgical interventions.

Dermatology

Although causing minor morbidity, dermatologic problems can be
highly distressing to patients and families due to appearance (e.g., alopecia), discomfort (e.g., eczema, hidradenitis), or intractability (e.g.,
onychomycosis). Common conditions include folliculitis, hidradenitis
suppurativa, eczematous and seborrheic dermatitis, autoimmune alopecia and vitiligo, fungal infections including tinea pedis and onychomycosis, angular cheilitis, and hyperkeratosis.

DEVELOPMENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL
CHARACTERISTICS

Development and behavior concerns are almost universal. Some
concerns are easily explained and remediated and are responsive to
appropriate therapeutic or behavioral interventions, but others may
indicate an underlying neurobehavioral disorder such as autism,
ADHD, depression, or anxiety (Table 57.6). Thinking through the categories that follow will help clinicians understand this complexity and
direct families to appropriate resources.

Motor Skills

Children with DS often have marked delays in motor skills in early
development related to hypotonia, ligamentous laxity, and lack of
coordination.
Acquisition of early gross motor skills is foundational for postural control, feeding, visual motor development, socialization, and
communication. Without stimulation and support, infants with DS
may persist in lax postural control, further adding to motor delays.
Through toddler and childhood many gradually improve but have
persistent deficits in motor control and coordination and more difficulty with speed and complex postural changes, as well as persistent hypotonia. Physical therapy in the first years of life concentrates
on core strengthening and ensuring acquisition of adaptive motor
planning that supports effective ambulation. Gait abnormalities and
persistent low core strength often require ongoing physical therapy.
Developing physical literacy in recreational fitness activities, such as
swimming, and community sports can also support health and well-­
being in school-­age and adult years.
Oromotor skills are often delayed, with dysphagia in half of infants,
requiring feeding therapy, thickening of formula, low-­flow nipples,
pacing between swallows, and sometimes supplemental enteral feeding. Feeding therapy helps young children learn to handle food
boluses, chew, and drink from a cup.
Fine motor skills are also delayed, although they seem to be acquired
in the same sequence as typically developing peers, but with a wider
age range of acquisition. Most unaffected children are able to write
their name between 60 and 72 months, but in children with DS, this
usually occurs between 120 and 216 months. Occupational therapy
often helps remediate or compensate for motor difficulties interfering
with independence in activities of daily living.

Speech and Language Skills

Individuals with DS often have difficulty speaking clearly enough to
be readily comprehensible to listeners across the life span resulting
in communication breakdowns, which can be frustrating to both
parties. Typical children are 90–100% intelligible by age 4 years.
In individuals with DS over 50% of parents reported frequent difficulties in intelligibility over the age of 5 years into adulthood, and
almost all qualify for a diagnosis of a motor speech disorder. Differences in voice quality, articulation, phonology, fluency, prosody, and
motor coordination (apraxia) all contribute to making speech hard to
understand (see Chapter 53). The complexity of speech impairments
in children with DS requires speech therapy evaluation with targeted
interventions for each individual.
Children with DS relative to children matched for nonverbal
skills show similar abilities in receptive vocabulary but impairments
in expressive vocabulary, syntax, grammar, and verbal short-­term

372 Part IV u Learning and Developmental Disorders
memory indicative of a specific language impairment (SLI). The
frequency of such impairments requires comprehensive language
assessment for all children with DS. The language impairment may
be associated with decreased ability to express thoughts and feelings
verbally and use of fewer words in answer to questions or to carry on
a conversation.
Misunderstandings may occur if the individual refers to past
events in the present tense or thinks that something described as a
future event will happen immediately. Verbal short-­term memory
deficits affect comprehension of more complex language (e.g., multistep instructions, complex sentences, conversation, and narrative)
and reading comprehension. Visual, contextual, and multisensory
supports incorporated into both receptive and expressive language
can be helpful.
Speech and language intervention has been shown to be effective,
especially when of higher intensity; focused on individual needs and
targeted skills; and when taking into account the individual’s age,
interests, and motivators. Use of applied behavior analysis to teach
communication skills improves outcomes. Incorporating interventions
across contexts (classroom, home, and community settings) and into
pragmatic language situations outside of structured learning settings
(e.g., peer interaction, conversation) supports generalization of skills
learned in therapy. For some individuals with DS, speech and language intervention will be required through school and possibly into
adulthood.

Social and Emotional Development

Social and emotional development occurs as a complex transactional
process between the child and their social partners. Children with
developmental delays will likely also have delays in their social interactions, social communication, and play. Children with DS often have
a strong orientation toward sociability. From early infancy, mutual
gaze in babies with DS emerges more slowly but once established
tends to last longer, with sometimes strong preferences for looking
at people as opposed to toys and other objects. Development of joint
attention is commensurate with developmental age-­matched peers
and may be a relative strength. Strong imitation skills are noted in
children with DS. Children with DS show stronger pro-­social empathetic responses to others’ distress, but their own expression of distress tends to be dampened (often described as high pain tolerance
or, in older children, a perceived reluctance to acknowledge feelings
of distress).
There are relative weaknesses in social development, which can help
explain some of the social difficulties caregivers encounter. Children
with DS have been shown to socially reference less frequently, with
shorter glances toward others, and some have more difficulty interpreting the facial expressions of others. Older children with DS have
more restricted repetitive behaviors and interests, including rigidity
and insistence on sameness. Despite typical social motivation, they
may have difficulties with social cognition and difficulty gaining and
maintaining friendships. Having friends has been associated with
improved quality of life in children with DS. Most adolescents are
happy with their level of friendships, but friends may include helpers
and adult companions. Leisure time is often spent at home with family
or by themselves, and socializing with same-­age peer-­friends occurs
predominantly in the context of common educational or community
activities. Building healthy sustained friendships with both TD peers
and those with developmental disabilities often requires active ongoing caregiver and community support to prevent social isolation and
loneliness as children transition to adulthood.

Cognition

Individuals with DS have varied degrees of intellectual and learning disabilities. Intelligence quotient (IQ) scores of adults with DS
are mostly in the 40s-­60s, and tests of adaptive functioning typically
have standard scores in the low 50s. In children with DS, IQ scores
tend to decline with age because progress is slower than same-­age

peers, and deficits are more marked in higher-­level thinking. Thus
the gap between children with DS and same-­age peers widens with
age. An actual plateau in functioning before mid-­adolescence or a
decline at any age is not typical and should prompt thorough etiologic
evaluation.
IQ scores are of limited value for intervention planning, as they
provide limited information about relative strengths and weaknesses. Children with DS often have relative strengths in areas of
imitation, implicit memory, visual spatial sequencing, visual spatial
construction, and nonverbal memory. Relative weaknesses tend to
occur in working memory capacity, explicit memory, verbal processing, auditory short-­term memory, more complex visual spatial
skills (mental rotation, closure, wayfinding), and executive functioning (see Chapter 49). Recognizing a child’s individual learning
profile and building on strengths while supporting weaknesses will
help caregivers, teachers, and therapists work together to teach children effectively to their potential.
Children’s reading skills are generally commensurate with their
nonverbal mental age. Many children with DS can learn to read,
some phonologically, some orthographically. Reading comprehension largely relies on language comprehension skills and is often
more difficult.
Mathematics is much more difficult because of weak working memory, language deficits, and fine motor skills. Math interventions generally include direct instruction, modeling, guided and repeated practice,
and use of concrete materials.

Due to the sociability associated with children with DS, ASDs have
been underrecognized in the past but are estimated to occur in 15–20%
of children with DS. Studies also have shown that autism symptoms
are not attributable to the degree of developmental disability and that
individuals with DS and ASD are distinct from those with DS alone.
Children with DS who show high levels of repetitive behavior, maladaptive behaviors (e.g., aggression, self-­injury, destructive behaviors), social
isolation, or difficulty with reciprocal social interaction should be referred
for further evaluation, even when overtly sociable. Children with ASD
require specialized behavioral and educational interventions with an
emphasis on functional communication, social and play skills development, and sensory-­based supports (see Chapter 58).

ADHD

The reported incidence of ADHD in children with DS varies greatly,
from 14% to 44%. Inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, the
core symptoms of ADHD, are nonspecific, and it can be difficult
to differentiate all the factors contributing to these symptoms in
children with DS (see Chapter 50). From a clinical perspective, the
diagnosis of ADHD relies on reports of ADHD symptoms from
two different settings (usually parent and teacher) and dysfunction
caused by the ADHD symptoms in areas such as learning, socialization, and safety. Medication use in ADHD has been shown to
be effective in children with DS, but the response rates are lower
than in typical peers with ADHD. Further, there are higher rates
of significant side effects, with some children showing decline in
behavior and cognitive performance on medication.

Aggression and Self-­Injurious Behaviors

Aggressive behavior is more common in children with many genetic
disorders, including DS. The estimated incidence in DS is 4–15%,
which is higher than the general population but less than many other
genetic syndromes. Aggression disproportionately affects quality of life
for the individual and family members and may result in the use of
medications and more restrictive educational placements. These behaviors occur more often in males and in individuals with ASD, ADHD,
or poor communication skills. Self-­injurious behavior (SIB) occurs in

Chapter 58 u Autism Spectrum Disorder
∼18%. Individuals with DS who engage in SIB are likely to have lower
cognitive and communication ability (may be nonverbal), more repetitive behaviors, higher levels of activity and impulsivity, and fewer social
interactions. Assessment of aggression or SIB should include a functional behavioral analysis (FBA) along with overall skills assessment
with emphasis on communication. New onset or escalation of aggression or SIB should also include careful assessment for potential sources
of pain or discomfort that may exacerbate these behaviors. Behavioral
interventions designed based on the results of the FBA should be the
initial intervention. Medications may be needed to address symptoms
of ADHD, irritability, mood, or anxiety.

Oppositional Behaviors

Disobedience and stubbornness are common. In some cases, this
behavior may relate, at least in part, to differences in cognitive
processing. Children with DS have difficulty shifting attention or
disengaging from activities. They often desire sameness and resist
changes to routine or to the way they think things should be done.
Difficulties with language comprehension or frustration with a task
or trying to express oneself may result in behaviors that are seen
as oppositional. When combined with difficulty problem solving,
low frustration tolerance, and emotional dysregulation, disruptive
or sometimes verbally or physically aggressive behaviors may result.
Before diagnosing a child as having oppositional defiant disorder
(see Chapter 42), clinicians should try to understand potential comprehension or skill deficits that may be contributing to the behavior. If the child has difficulty with transitions, interventions to help
them shift activities more easily such as transition routines, warnings, or countdowns may be most helpful. Visual schedules can also
be helpful to prepare the child for what is next, as can providing
some additional time for the transition. Simplifying language can
help avert communication frustration.

Anxiety

There is an increased prevalence of anxiety disorder in children
with DS compared with typical peers. Generally, anxiety disorders
are diagnosed based on verbal descriptions of fear or worry and the
impact of the fear or worrying on functioning or individual distress. Whereas some individuals with DS have the language skills
to describe these experiences, others do not. Clinicians often need
to rely on the history from caregivers and contextual cues. Behavioral reactions to anxiety can result in flight-­or-­fight responses.
Thus anxiety could manifest with aggressive or escape/avoidance
behaviors. Cognitive-­
behavioral therapy or exposure therapies
can be helpful, and medication management is sometimes needed
when anxiety is overwhelming or affects sleep or daytime functioning. Evidence for effectiveness of intervention in DS specifically is
sparse.

Obsessive-­Compulsive or Perseverative Behaviors

Children and adults with DS often need specific things to be a certain
way or may have repetitive patterns of behavior that can seem obsessive or compulsive. They may spend many minutes arranging pillows
on their bed, need all doors in the house to be shut, make long lists,
or perseveratively ask about upcoming events. These behaviors can be
associated with anxiety, and the possibility of increased anxiety should
be investigated if there are sudden increases in intensity or frequency
of these behaviors.

Depression

The prevalence of depression in DS ranges from 4% to 11%, with
most studies being done in adults. This may be an underestimation,
as depression in individuals with intellectual disability can be difficult to diagnose because of limited abilities to self-­report internal
mood states. Behavioral symptoms can include anxiety, increases
in obsessive-­compulsive behaviors, depressed affect, crying for no
reason, lack of emotion, social isolation, anhedonia, irritability with

373

increases in outbursts or aggression, sleep disturbance, psychomotor retardation, low self-­esteem, catatonia, and psychosis. Clinicians
need to consider potential contributing factors, including medical
factors, recent life stressors, trauma, and family history. Anecdotally, interventions that involve reengagement in previously enjoyed
activities and treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs) can be effective.

Catatonia (Also Known as Down Syndrome
Disintegrative Disorder or Down Syndrome
Regression Disorder)

Older children and young adults can experience a sudden regression
in communication, socialization, and daily living skills associated with
psychomotor retardation, negative mood or mood lability, refusal to
participate in activities, social withdrawal, and insomnia with signs
and symptoms of catatonia on the Bush Frances Catatonia Scale (see
Chapter 47.3). Patients should undergo a medical evaluation for
mental status change. Contributing etiologic factors include stressful
events, depression, anxiety, or high physiologic stress. Treatment consists of addressing the underlying suspected cause and may include a
trial of Ativan and then electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) if Ativan is
unsuccessful.

Autism Spectrum Disorder

DEFINITION

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurobiologic disorder with
onset in early childhood. The key features are impairment in social
communication and social interaction and restricted and repetitive
behaviors. The presentation of ASD can vary significantly from one
individual to another, as well as over the course of development for a
particular child. There is currently no diagnostic biomarker for ASD.
Accurate diagnosis therefore requires careful review of the history and
direct observation of the child’s behavior.

DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND SYMPTOMS

The diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth
Edition (DSM-­5) focus on symptoms in two primary domains: (1)
social communication and social interaction and (2) restricted interests and repetitive behaviors (Table 58.1). To meet criteria for ASD,
the symptoms need to have been present since the early developmental period, significantly affect functioning, and not be better explained
by the diagnosis of intellectual disability (ID) or global developmental
delay (GDD; Chapter 56). Table 58.2 provides associated features not
included in the DSM-­5 criteria.
Symptoms can present in infancy, with reduced response to name
and unusual use of objects being strong predictors for risk of ASD.
However, symptoms before age 12 months are not as reliably predictive of later diagnosis. Individuals with milder severity may not present

until preschool or school age, when the social demands for peer interaction and group participation are higher.

Social Communication and Social Interaction

Individuals with ASD have difficulty understanding and engaging in
social relationships. The problems are pervasive and affect three major
areas: social-­emotional reciprocity, nonverbal communication, and
understanding of social relationships. The presentation can vary with
severity and developmental functioning. A diagnosis of ASD requires
the presence of symptoms from all three categories (Table 58.3).

Social-­Emotional Reciprocity

Reduced social interactions in ASD may range from active avoidance
or reduced social response to having an interest in, but lacking ability
to initiate or sustain, an interaction with peers or adults. A young child
with ASD may not respond when their name is called, may exhibit limited showing and sharing behaviors, and may prefer solitary play. In

addition, the child may avoid attempts by others to play and may not
participate in activities that require taking turns, such as peek-­a-­boo
and ball play. An older child with ASD may have an interest in peers
but may not know how to initiate or join in play. The child may have
trouble understanding the rules of conversation and may either talk at
length about an area of interest or abruptly exit the interaction. Younger
children often have limited capacity for imaginative or pretend play.
Older children may engage in play and conversation but lack flexibility
and may be highly directive to peers. Some children with ASD interact
well with adults but struggle to interact with same-­age peers.

Nonverbal Communicative Behavior

Difficulties with nonverbal communication may manifest as reduced or
overly intense use of eye contact and gestures such as pointing. Children
may also show reduced awareness or response to the eye gaze or pointing
of others. They may use eye contact only when communicating a highly
preferred request or may have difficulty coordinating the use of nonverbal with verbal communication. Children with ASD may have limited
range of facial social-­communicative expression or expressed emotion.

Developing, Maintaining, and Understanding
Relationships

Children with ASD have limited insight regarding social relationships.
They may have difficulty understanding the difference between a true
friend and a casual acquaintance, and even when the definitions are
well understood, there may still be difficulty in developing and maintaining more intimate relationships They have trouble picking up on
the nuances of social interactions and understanding social expectations for polite behavior. They may have reduced understanding of personal boundaries and may stand too close to others. In addition, they
can have trouble understanding and inferring others’ emotions and are
less likely to share emotion or enjoyment with others. Adolescents and
young adults have difficulty engaging in group interactions and navigating romantic relationships.

Restrictive and Repetitive Behavior

A diagnosis of ASD requires the presence of two of the four symptoms
of restrictive and repetitive patterns of behavior discussed next.

Stereotyped Motor Movements or Speech

Stereotyped (or stereotypic) movements and repetitive behaviors
may include hand flapping, finger movements, body rocking and
lunging, jumping, running and spinning, and repetitive speech such
as echoing words immediately after they are said. Repetitive patterns of play may be present, such as lining up objects, repetitively
turning light switches on and off or opening and closing doors,
spinning objects, or arranging toys in a specific manner. These
repetitive patterns may not be seen in very young toddlers but may
develop as they get older. Stereotyped movements can change over
time and in older children are seen more often in individuals with
lower cognitive functioning.

Insistence on Sameness

Children with ASD have difficulty tolerating transitions or change.
They may insist on certain routines or schedules and can become
very distressed with unexpected events or new situations. They may
repeat scripts from shows or movies or watch the same portion of
a video repeatedly. Intolerance for change can cause significant
impairment and irritability and have an effect on child and family
function.

Restricted Interests

This symptom may manifest as interests that seem of greater intensity
when compared to same-­age peers. Younger children may play with a
limited range of toys or may insist on retaining a small object in each
hand. Older children may have a strong preference for a particular
story or movie. The area of interest may be shared by peers (e.g., Disney movies, Legos, Thomas the Train) but unusual in its intensity.
Other affected children may have interests that are both intense and

Table 58.3  Signs and Symptoms of Possible Autism in Preschool Children (or Equivalent Mental Age)
Spoken Language
Language delay (in babbling or using words; e.g., using <10 words
by age 2 yr).
Regression in, or loss of, use of speech.
Spoken language (if present) may include unusual features, such
as vocalizations that are not speechlike; odd or flat intonation;
frequent repetition of set words and phrases (echolalia); reference
to self by name or “you” or “she” or “he” beyond age 3 yr.
Reduced and/or infrequent use of language for communication (e.g.,
use of single words, although able to speak in sentences).
Responding to Others
Absent or delayed response to name being called, despite normal
hearing.
Reduced or absent responsive social smiling.
Reduced or absent responsiveness to other people’s facial
expressions or feelings.
Unusually negative response to the requests of others (“demand
avoidance” behavior).
Rejection of cuddles initiated by parent or caregiver, although the
child may initiate cuddles.
Interacting with Others
Reduced or absent awareness of personal space, or unusually
intolerant of people entering their personal space.
Reduced or absent social interest in others, including children of
own age—may reject others; if interested in others, child may
approach others inappropriately, seeming to be aggressive or
disruptive.
Reduced or absent imitation of others’ actions.
Reduced or absent initiation of social play with others; plays alone.
Reduced or absent enjoyment of situations that most children like
(e.g., birthday parties).
Reduced or absent sharing of enjoyment.

Eye Contact, Pointing, and Other Gestures
Reduced or absent use of gestures and facial expressions
to communicate (although may place an adult’s hand on
objects).
Reduced and poorly integrated gestures, facial expressions, body
orientation, eye contact (looking at people’s eyes when speaking),
and speech used in social communication.
Reduced or absent social use of eye contact (assuming adequate
vision).
Reduced or absent “joint attention” (when one person alerts another
to something by means of gazing, finger pointing, or other verbal
or nonverbal indication for the purpose of sharing interest). This
would be evident in the child from lack of:
Gaze switching
Following a point (looking where the other person points to—may
look at hand)
Using pointing at or showing objects to share interest
Ideas and Imagination
Reduced or absent imagination and variety of pretend play.
Unusual or Restricted Interests and/or Rigid and Repetitive
Behaviors
Repetitive “stereotypic” movements such as hand flapping, body
rocking while standing, spinning, and finger flicking.
Repetitive or stereotyped play (e.g., opening and closing doors).
Overfocused or unusual interests.
Excessive insistence on following own agenda.
Extremes of emotional reactivity to change or new situations;
insistence on things being “the same.”
Overreaction or underreaction to sensory stimuli, such as textures,
sounds, or smells.
Excessive reaction to the taste, smell, texture, or appearance of
food, or having extreme food fads.

unusual, such as an interest in brands of vehicles, license plate numbers, or fans and heating systems. These interests interfere with social
interactions; a child may only want to talk about their area of interest
or may insist that peers act out a particular story in a rigid and inflexible manner.

Hyporeactivity or Hyperreactivity to Sensory Input

Children with ASD may be overly sensitive to sensory input, such
as noise, smells, or texture. Children may scream or react strongly
when they hear a siren or vacuum and may gag and choke with certain foods or odors. They may refuse to wear certain clothing or may
become very distressed with bathing or with cutting nails and hair.
Conversely, some affected children seem to crave sensory input. They
may engage in repetitive jumping or hugging and may smell or lick
objects or people. Young children may inappropriately touch the face
or hair of others.
Diagnosing ASD with DSM-­5 criteria can be challenging in very
young children because of reduced expression of repetitive behaviors,
particularly stereotyped behavior and intense interests. Studies monitoring development in high-­risk young children who have an older
sibling with ASD indicate these additional symptoms may emerge
over time. This creates a dilemma for specialty clinicians evaluating
very young children for ASD, because they may not be able to endorse
sufficient symptoms to make an early diagnosis and access specialized
intervention services.

Severity Levels Defined in DSM-­5

Severity levels in ASD are based on the level of support the individual
requires in each of the major domains impacted—social communication and restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Levels range from
“needing support” (level 1), to “needing substantial support” (level 2),
to “needing very substantial support” (level 3) (Table 58.4).

Specifiers Defined in DSM-­5

A formal diagnosis of ASD also includes documenting associated
conditions, including whether the individual has cognitive and/or
language impairment; any related medical, genetic, or environmental factors; and any other neurodevelopmental or behavioral health
conditions, including catatonia (Table 58.5). This process helps
to better characterize the presentation in an individual child and
ensures that the diagnosis has been made by considering the symptoms in the context of the child’s current cognitive and language
abilities.

EPIDEMIOLOGY

The prevalence of ASD is estimated at 1 in 36 persons by the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This information comes from prevalence data of 8-­year-­olds derived from
11 sites participating in the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Network (ADDM) and shows a greater than 300% increase in
prevalence since systematic surveillance began in the year 2000.
The increased prevalence relates, at least in part, to improved diagnosis and case finding, as well as inclusion of less severe presentations within the autism spectrum. There is a 4:1 male predominance,
although new emerging information suggests that the prevalence in
females may be higher than previously believed. Females with ASD
often use “camouflaging,” which is intentionally or unconsciously
hiding social communication difficulties by mimicking the facial
expressions of others, having more effective compensatory behaviors, and displaying less clearly unusual preoccupying interests. All
of these things, including clinician bias, may decrease girls with
ASD being diagnosed. The prevalence is increased in siblings (up
to 18% recurrence rate) and particularly in identical twins. There
are no racial or ethnic differences in prevalence. Individuals from
racial minorities and lower socioeconomic status are at risk for later

Table 58.4  DSM-­5 Severity Levels for Autism Spectrum Disorder
SEVERITY LEVEL

SOCIAL COMMUNICATION

RESTRICTED, REPETITIVE BEHAVIORS

Level 3
“Requiring very
­substantial
­support”

Severe deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills cause
severe impairments in functioning, very limited initiation of social
interactions, and minimal response to social overtures from others.
For example, a person with few words of intelligible speech who
rarely initiates interaction and, when he or she does, makes unusual
approaches to meet needs only and responds to only very direct social
approaches.

Inflexibility of behavior, extreme difficulty
coping with change, or other restricted/
repetitive behaviors markedly interfere with
functioning in all spheres. Great distress/
difficulty changing focus or action.

Level 2
“Requiring
substantial
support”

Marked deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills;
social impairments apparent even with supports in place; limited
initiation of social interactions; and reduced or abnormal responses to
social overtures from others. For example, a person who speaks simple
sentences, whose interaction is limited to narrow special interests, and
who has markedly odd nonverbal communication.

Inflexibility of behavior, difficulty coping with
change, or other restricted/repetitive behaviors
appear frequently enough to be obvious to the
casual observer and interfere with functioning
in a variety of contexts. Distress and/or difficulty
changing focus or action.

Level 1
“Requiring support”

Without supports in place, deficits in social communication cause
noticeable impairments. Difficulty initiating social interactions,
and clear examples of atypical or unsuccessful responses to social
overtures of others. May appear to have decreased interest in social
interactions. For example, a person who is able to speak in full
sentences and engages in communication but whose to-­and-­fro
conversation with others fails and whose attempts to make friends are
odd and typically unsuccessful.

Inflexibility of behavior causes significant
interference with functioning in one or
more contexts. Difficulty switching between
activities. Problems of organization and
planning hamper independence.

diagnosis, although the most recent prevalence data suggest that
this gap is closing.

ETIOLOGY

The etiology of ASD is thought to result from disrupted neural connectivity and is primarily impacted by genetic variations affecting
early brain development. Animal models and studies of individuals
with ASD indicate changes in brain volume and neural cell density
in the limbic system, cerebellum, and frontotemporal regions. One
study documented changes in early brain development, characterized as “hyperexpansion of cortical surface area,” at age 6-­12 months
on brain MRI, which correlated with later development of impaired
social skills. Functional studies show abnormalities of processing
information, particularly related to foundational social skills such
as facial recognition. The disruptions in early brain development
likely are responsive to treatment. Early developmental therapies in
young children with ASD have demonstrated the capacity for normalization of electrophysiologic response to visual stimuli, including faces.
Numerous genes involved in brain development and synaptic function have been associated with ASD. Pathogenic variants that include
large genetic deletions or duplications and small sequencing changes
have been implicated; these can be inherited or occur de novo. Heterozygous mutations in genes, such as present in deletion or duplication
of 15q11.2 or 16p11.2, may have variable expression within a family.
Rare recessive mutations have been implicated in some populations
with high levels of consanguinity. Patients with a number of genetic
syndromes (e.g., fragile X, Down, Smith-­Lemli-­Opitz, Rett, Angelman,
Timothy, Joubert), as well as disorders of metabolism and mitochondrial function have higher rates of ASD than the general population
(Tables 58.5, 58.6, and 58.7).
There is also possible evidence for environmental contributions to
ASD. Older maternal or paternal age may increase the risk of ASD.
In addition, factors influencing the intrauterine environment, such as
maternal obesity or overweight, short interval from prior pregnancy,
premature birth, and certain prenatal infections (e.g., rubella, cytomegalovirus), are associated with ASD. Population-­level associations
have been investigated for environmental toxins such as organophosphates, pesticides, air pollution, and volatile organic compounds. An
epigenetic model is considered one explanation for the etiology; individuals with genetic vulnerability may be more sensitive to environmental factors influencing early brain development.

Despite frequent concerns from families that vaccines or the preservatives in vaccines lead to ASD, there is no evidence to support this
claim. Multiple research studies and meta-­analyses have failed to show
an association of vaccines with ASD.
No biomarkers are available yet, but there is emerging evidence from
neuroimaging findings, electrophysiologic testing, and eye tracking
that hold the promise for presymptomatic detection along with accurate clinical diagnosis and prognostic assessment.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

The differential diagnosis of ASD is complex because many conditions
in the differential can also occur with ASD. The most important conditions to consider in young children are language disorder (see Chapter
53), ID or GDD (Chapter 56), and hearing loss (Chapter 55). Children
with language disorder may have impairments in social communication and play; their social and play skills, however, are typically
on par with their language level. In addition, they do not have associated restricted and repetitive behavior or atypical use of language,
such as scripting. The diagnosis of social communication disorder
is also distinguished from ASD by the lack of restrictive and repetitive behaviors. Children with ID or GDD may have delays in social
and communication skills as well as stereotyped behavior. However,
social and communication skills are typically commensurate with their
cognitive and adaptive functioning. Children with hearing loss may
present with some “red flags” for ASD, such as poor response to
name. However, they typically develop nonverbal communication
and play skills as expected and do not have stereotyped or restricted
behavior patterns.
In older children, disorders of attention, learning, and mood regulation must be considered in the differential diagnosis of ASD. Children
with attention-­
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may present with reduced eye contact and response to name caused by poor
attention rather than lack of social awareness. Children with ADHD,
however, do not have associated impairments in shared enjoyment and
social reciprocity or repetitive behaviors. Children with social anxiety
or other anxiety disorders may present with some symptoms suggestive
of ASD. Shy children may have reduced eye contact and social initiation. Anxious children can be resistant to change and prefer familiar
routines. Children with anxiety, however, typically will have preserved
social interest and insight and will not exhibit high levels of stereotyped
behaviors. Reactive attachment disorder can be difficult to distinguish
from ASD, particularly in younger children with a history of prolonged

COMMENTS
Prevalence estimate is affected by the diagnostic boundary and definition of
intelligence (e.g., whether verbal ability is used as a criterion).
In individuals, discrepant performance between subtests is common.
An autism-­specific language profile (separate from language disorders) exists, but with
substantial interindividual variability.
∼6.5% have Tourette syndrome.
See Table 58.2.
Increased frequency in individuals with intellectual disability or genetic syndromes.
Two peaks of onset: early childhood and adolescence.
Increases risk of poor outcome.
Common symptoms include chronic constipation, abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea,
cyclic vomiting, and gastroesophageal reflux.
Associated disorders include gastritis, esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease,
inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, Crohn disease, and colitis.
Associated with allergic and autoimmune disorders.
Collectively called syndromic autism.
Examples include fragile X syndrome (21–50% of individuals affected have autism), Rett
syndrome (most have autistic features but with profiles different from idiopathic autism),
tuberous sclerosis complex (24–60%), Down syndrome (5–39%), phenylketonuria (5–20%),
CHARGE syndrome* (15–50%), Angelman syndrome (50–81%), Timothy syndrome
(60–70%), and Joubert syndrome (∼40%).
Insomnia is the most common.

Common across all age-­groups.
Most common are social anxiety disorder (13–29% of individuals with autism) and
generalized anxiety disorder (13–22%).
High-­functioning individuals are more susceptible (or symptoms are more detectable).
Autism shutdown disorder similar to Down syndrome disintegrative disorder
(see Chapters 47.3 and 57).
Common in adults, less common in children.
High-­functioning adults who are less socially impaired are more susceptible (or
symptoms are more detectable).
Shares the repetitive behavior domain with autism that could cut across nosologic
categories.
Important to distinguish between repetitive behaviors that do not involve intrusive,
anxiety-­causing thoughts or obsessions (part of autism) and those that do (and are
part of OCD).
Mainly in adults.
Most commonly recurrent hallucinosis.
High frequency of autism-­like features (even a diagnosis of ASD) preceding adult-­onset
(52%) and childhood-­onset schizophrenia (30–50%).
Potentially because individual is using substances as self-­medication to relieve anxiety.
Oppositional behaviors could be a manifestation of anxiety, resistance to change,
stubborn belief in the correctness of own point of view, difficulty seeing another’s
point of view, poor awareness of the effect of own behavior on others, or no interest
in social compliance.
Avoidant/restrictive food intake may lead to nutrient deficiencies and poor growth.

COMMENTS
Often directed toward caregivers rather than noncaregivers.
Could be a result of empathy difficulties, anxiety, sensory overload, disruption of
routines, and difficulties with communication.
Associated with impulsivity and hyperactivity, negative affect, and lower levels of ability
and speech.
Could signal frustration in individuals with reduced communication, as well as anxiety,
sensory overload, or disruption of routines.
Could also become a repetitive habit.
Could cause tissue damage and need for restraint.
More likely in individuals with intellectual disability.
Could be a result of a lack of social conformity to cultural categories of what is deemed
edible, or sensory exploration, or both.
Risks increase with concurrent depression and behavioral problems and after being
teased or bullied.

neglect or trauma. However, social behaviors in these children generally improve with positive caretaking.
The differentiation of ASD from obsessive-­compulsive disorder
(OCD), tics, and stereotyped behaviors can sometimes be challenging.
In general, stereotyped behaviors may be calming or preferred, whereas
tics and compulsive routines generally are distressing to the individual.
Children with OCD have intense interests, as well as repetitive behaviors and rituals, but do not have impairment in social communication
or interaction. Children with stereotypic movement disorder will not
have impaired social skills or other types of restricted and repetitive
behaviors. Children with Landau Kleffner syndrome (LKS) present
with a loss of skills in language comprehension (auditory verbal agnosia) and verbal expression (aphasia) associated with onset of epileptic
seizures during sleep (see Chapter 53). In contrast to ASD, children
with LKS usually present with typical early development followed by
loss of language function at age 3-­6 years.

CO-­OCCURRING CONDITIONS

Between 35% and 50% of individuals with ASD have ID, ranging in
severity from mild to severe (see Table 58.5). An additional 23% of
children have intellectual functioning in the borderline range (IQ
= 71-­85), and approximately 40% of individuals with ASD are nonverbal. ID is associated with higher rates of both identified genetic
conditions and epilepsy. Children with ASD often have associated
language impairments, including delays in expressive, receptive,
and pragmatic (social) language skills. Language function can range

Chapter 58 u Autism Spectrum Disorder
widely from nonverbal status to age appropriate. Gastrointestinal
(GI) problems such as cyclic vomiting, constipation, esophagitis,
and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are reported in up to
70% of children with ASD. Epilepsy occurs in up to 35–46% of children with ASD and presents in two peaks: in early childhood and in
adolescence. Children with ID, female gender, and lower gestational
age are at higher risk for having seizures.
Overall, between 70% and 90% of children with ASD are identified
as having a co-­occurring behavioral health condition, with ADHD
being the most common, occurring in between 40% and 70% of children with ASD. There are higher rates of anxiety (∼40%) and mood
disorders in ASD, particularly during adolescence. Children with ASD
are also at increased risk for being bullied and may present with secondary irritability, anxiety, or depression. Adolescents may develop
gender-­nonconforming roles, gender variance, and transgender identities; this may also lead to being bullied. Children with ASD are at high
risk for suicidal ideation and attempts. Catatonia can also occur, most
commonly developing during the teenage years, and may present with
changes in activity level, unusual movements, and behavioral regression or loss of skills (Chapter 47.3).
Sleep problems, including delayed sleep onset, frequent night waking, and abnormal sleep architecture, are reported in 50–80% of children with ASD. There is some evidence for baseline abnormalities in
melatonin secretion. The use of screen-­based activities such as television, computers, or tablets before bedtime can inhibit melatonin
secretion.
Children with ASD commonly have high rates of feeding and
toileting problems resulting from resistance to change, sensory
sensitivity, and repetitive behavior patterns. Many children with
ASD have restrictive feeding patterns and food selectivity. DSM-­5
introduced the diagnosis of avoidant and restrictive food intake
disorder (ARFID) that, although not specific to children with
ASD, describes a pattern of a severely disturbed eating experience
resulting in nutritional deficiency or inadequate weight gain and
may affect as many as 21% of children with ASD. Restrictive eating
patterns may lead to nutritional deficiencies, such as scurvy, rickets, anemia, or protein malnutrition. Children with ASD also have
higher rates of overweight, possibly because of diets higher in carbohydrates, reduced physical activity, use of food rewards to regulate behavior, and side effects from medications used for managing
mood and behavior. As many as 25% of preschool-­age children with
ASD have pica (eating of nonfood items), and this tends to persist
in children with co-­occurring ID.
Self-­injury and aggression are common in ASD patients, but most
common in individuals with lower cognitive function and limited language. Sleep deprivation, nutritional deficits, pain, epilepsy, and medication side effects may contribute to these behaviors.
Wandering frequently co-­occurs with ASD, with nearly 50% of children between 4 and 10 years of age reported as trying to elope. In children who were missing long enough to call the police, approximately
66% were at risk for traffic-­related injury and nearly 30% had near-­
drowning events, which is the leading cause of death in children who
wander.

SCREENING

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening for ASD
for all children at age 18 months and 24 months (see Chapter 28).
Screening should also occur when there is increased risk for ASD, such
as a child with an older sibling who has ASD, or whenever there is
concern for possible ASD. Screening can be done by a parent checklist
or direct assessment. The most frequently used screening tool is the
Modified Checklist for Autism, Revised/Follow-­Up Interview (MCHAT­R/FU), a 20-­item parent report measure, with additional standardized
parent interview completed for intermediate scores. The MCHAT-­R/
FU can be used from age 16-­30 months. Children who score ≥8 or
between 3 and 7 after the parent interview are at high risk for a diagnosis of ASD or some developmental delay. The Parent’s Observation
of Social Interaction (POSI) is another commonly used autism specific
screener. It includes seven items.

ASSESSMENT

Diagnostic assessment optimally should include medical evaluation
and assessment of the child’s cognitive, language, and adaptive function. Developmental-­
behavioral pediatricians, neurodevelopmental
disability specialists, neurologists, psychiatrists, and psychologists are
qualified to make a formal diagnosis of ASD. Other specialists, including speech-­language pathologists and occupational therapists, should
also be included depending on the child’s age and the presenting
concerns.
Assessment of ASD includes direct observation of the child to
evaluate social-­communicative skills and behavior. Informal observation can be supplemented with structured diagnostic tools such as
the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-­
2) or the Toddler module (ADOS-­T). These structured play-­based
assessments provide social prompts and opportunities to evaluate the
frequency and quality of a child’s social responsiveness to, initiation,
and maintenance of social interactions, the capacity for joint attention and shared enjoyment; the child’s behavioral flexibility; and the
presence of repetitive patterns of behavior and preoccupying interests. These measures also provide some understanding of a child’s
insight about social relationships and emotional awareness. The
ADOS-­2 and ADOS-­T are not required for accurate diagnosis and do
not stand alone, but rather can be used to augment a careful history
and observation. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale, Second Edition
(CARS-­2) is a 15-­item direct clinical observation instrument that
can assist clinicians in the diagnosis of ASD. The Autism Diagnostic
Interview-­Revised (ADI-­R) is a lengthy clinical interview tool that is
used primarily in research settings because it takes several hours to
administer. Other tools include standardized rating scales, such as
the Social Responsiveness Scale or the Social Communication Questionnaire, that parents and teachers can complete to report on the
child’s social skills and behaviors. There is an emergence of the use of
telehealth to assess children with ASD, and preliminary studies have
suggested that 80% of children could be determined to have or not
have ASD with reasonable certainty.
Medical evaluation should include a thorough history and detailed
physical examination of the child, including direct behavioral observations of communication and play. In addition, the examination should
include measurement of head circumference, careful evaluation for
dysmorphic features, and screening for tuberous sclerosis with Wood
lamp exam. Children with ASD should have genetic testing, an audiology examination to rule out hearing loss, and in children with pica, a
lead test (Table 58.8).
There are currently several specialty-­specific clinical guidelines for
genetic evaluation of children diagnosed with ASD. Genetic testing is
shown to impact clinical decision-­making, but no studies have evaluated the impact of genetic testing on the outcome for the child. The
American College of Medical Genetics recommends a tiered approach
to genetic testing.

Initial Etiologic Assessment

All children with ASD should have a chromosomal microarray
(CMA). CMA will be positive in 10–15% of individuals with ASD.
The rate is increased to almost 30% in individuals who have complex
presentations, such as associated microcephaly, dysmorphic features,
congenital anomalies, or seizures. CMA technology will identify copy
number variants but not DNA sequencing errors, balanced translocations, or abnormalities in trinucleotide repeat length. Fragile X DNA
testing is recommended for all males with ASD. Fragile X testing should
also be considered in females with physical features suggestive of fragile X syndrome or with a family history of fragile X, X-­linked pattern of
ID, tremor/ataxia, or premature ovarian failure (see Chapter 59).

Second Tier Etiologic Assessment

Females with ASD should have testing for pathologic variants in the
MeCP2 gene. Males who have hypotonia, drooling, and frequent respiratory infections should have MeCP2 deletion/duplication testing.
All individuals with ASD and a head circumference greater than 2.5

tumor disorders (Cowden, Proteus-­
like, Bannayan-­

syndromes) in these individuals. Cytogenetic testing (karyotype) has a
lower yield than CMA. Karyotype is recommended if microarray is not
available and in children with suspected balanced translocation, such
as history of multiple prior miscarriages.
Further medical diagnostic testing is indicated by the child’s history
and presentation. Brain imaging (MRI) is indicated in cases of microcephaly, significant developmental regression, seizures, or focal findings
on neurologic examination. Because of the high rate (up to 25%) of macrocephaly in ASD, imaging is not indicated for macrocephaly alone. MRI
is not recommended for minor language regression (loss of a few words)
during the second year of life that is often described in toddlers with
ASD. Children with concern for seizures, spells, or developmental regression should have an electroencephalogram (EEG). Metabolic screening is
indicated for children with signs of a metabolic or mitochondrial disorder, such as developmental regression, weakness, fatigue, lethargy, cyclic
vomiting, or seizures (see Table 58.7 and Chapters 56 and 104).

Next-­Generation Sequencing

Whole exome sequencing (WES) can identify single-­nucleotide variants, including pathogenic loss of function mutations and missense
mutations; studies have identified a molecular diagnosis in nearly 30%
of individuals tested because of the presence of a neurodevelopmental

disorder. If the initial genetic testing is negative, clinicians should consider ordering this test in conjunction with genetic counseling to aid in
understanding results.

TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT
Approaches to Intervention

The primary treatment for ASD is done outside the medical setting
and includes developmental and educational programming (Fig. 58.1).
Numerous resources have been developed that can help families in the
complex process of treatment planning (Table 58.9). Intensive behavioral therapies have the strongest evidence to date. Earlier age at initiation of treatment and higher intensity of treatment are associated
with better outcomes, although recent studies comparing two different
treatments at different levels of intensity (15 vs 25 hr/wk) did not show
significant differences between groups in any of the outcomes assessed.
Programming must be individualized, and no approach is successful
for all children. In addition, research treatments are often conducted
with a high level of intensity and fidelity that is difficult to scale up
or reproduce in community settings. Higher cognitive, play, and joint
attention skills and lower symptom severity at baseline are predictors
for better outcomes in core symptoms, intellectual function, and language function.
There are many evidence-­based approaches to treating children with
ASD, with three main approaches identified. The intervention with the
strongest evidence base is applied behavioral analysis (ABA), which
is based on the principles of direct incremental teaching of skills within
a traditional behavioral framework using reinforcement of desired
behavior, careful data collection, and analysis and adjustment of the
treatment program based on review of data. The second is developmental relationship-­
based intervention (DRBI), which includes
parent-­mediated interventions that focus on building warm, meaningful interaction to improve communication, learning, and problem
solving. The best-­known approach in this category is Floortime. The
third approach is the naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention, which builds upon ABA to incorporate more choices for children and is implemented in natural situations. Comprehensive models
integrating behavioral and developmental approaches that build on
key foundational skills, such as joint attention, shared enjoyment, and
reciprocal communication, show strong evidence of efficacy for young
children, particularly toddlers, with ASD. Examples include the Early
Start Denver Model (ESDM), Joint Attention Symbolic Play Engagement
and Regulation (JASPER), and Social Communication/Emotional Regulation/Transactional Support (SCERTS).
Educational approaches such as the Treatment and Education of
Autistic and Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) incorporate structured teaching, visual supports, and adjustment of the
environment to the individual needs of students with ASD, such as difficulty with communication, understanding time, and need for routine.
These approaches have demonstrated efficacy for improved cognitive
and adaptive skills. For older children with more severe symptoms,
approaches that use behavioral principles in addition to adjusting the
environment may be most effective.
Speech and language therapy can help build vocabulary, comprehension, and pragmatic skills. Children with ASD benefit from visual supports
for comprehension, understanding expectations, and communicating their
needs. Augmentative communication approaches using photographs or
picture icons can improve comprehension and ability to communicate (see
Chapter 54). There are a range of options with varying levels of complexity, flexibility, and technology. Using augmentative communication does
not inhibit acquisition of verbal language. On the contrary, supporting a
child’s language development with augmentative supports can facilitate the
development of spoken language, even in older children.
Additional strategies to build social skills are used for school-­age
children and adolescents and may be administered in the school
or community setting by a variety of specialists, including speech
therapists, psychologists, and counselors. Social skills programs
that include training peer mentors have higher rates of efficacy.

Occupational and physical therapy may be indicated for individuals with motor delay and difficulty acquiring adaptive skills such as
dressing and toileting.
For some high school students with ASD, training in life skills
and vocational skills is critical for maximizing independence in
adulthood. Training may focus on basic self-­care (e.g., dressing,
hygiene), functional academics (e.g., money management, banking

skills), learning to fill out a job application, and understanding how
to behave with strangers and in work settings. Social skills and job
coaching may be needed even for adolescents with strong cognitive
and academic function, because they may struggle with social perception and may be vulnerable to exploitation by others.
There continue to be disparities in regard to accessing care, with
racially and ethnically minoritized groups and children from low-­
income families showing less access to acute care and specialized, community and educational services, when compared with higher-­income
and White families.

Co-­occurring Conditions

Additional medical or behavioral health treatment is often required
for the management of co-­occurring conditions in ASD. Seizures
occur in up to 35% of children with ASD and should be managed with appropriate antiepileptic therapy (see Chapter 633). GI
problems (e.g., cyclic vomiting, constipation, esophagitis, GERD)
may present with nonspecific irritability, sleep disturbance, self-­
injury, aggression, and signs of pain or discomfort, such as crying,
and can be managed with the same approaches used in typically

developing children. Children with pica should have lead and iron
levels monitored.
Management of co-­
o ccurring attention and mood disorders
is similar to that for typically developing children. Strategies to
increase structure and organization in the environment and use of
visual supports (e.g., schedules) can improve attention and reduce
anxiety. Some children with ASD benefit from modified cognitive-­
behavioral therapy to address anxiety and OCD. (see Chapter 31).
Strategies to promote sleep hygiene and use of behavioral
approaches, such as structured bedtime routines, can address
delayed sleep onset. Other medical problems, such as epilepsy or
GERD, can also contribute to poor sleep and should be treated
directly. In cases refractory to behavioral approaches, medications
may be used.
Structured behavioral approaches for delayed toilet training in
concert with treatment to prevent constipation are often needed
for children with ASD. For children with highly restrictive diets,
nutrition counseling and behaviorally based feeding therapy may
be needed to address poor caloric intake or lack of nutritional quality. Because of limited diets, children with ASD may be at risk for
low levels of calcium, vitamins C and D, and iron. Children who are
overweight may still have poor nutrition as a result of restrictive
diets.
Irritability is a nonspecific symptom and can be a reflection of pain,
anxiety, distress, or lack of sleep. Children with ASD are prone to irritability because of their difficulty tolerating change and their limited
communication skills. Management of irritability includes evaluating
carefully for medical problems that may be causing pain and for any
factors in the child’s home or school environment that may be causing distress. Possible causes of distress range from common experiences such as changes in the routine to undisclosed abuse or bullying.
Treatment should be targeted first at any underlying cause. Medications are often used to treat irritability in ASD, but should only be used
after appropriate behavioral and communication supports have been
implemented.

Pharmacology

There are currently no medications that treat the core symptoms of
ASD. Medications can be used to target specific co-­occurring conditions or symptoms (Table 58.10; see also Table 58.5). Families should
be cautioned, however, that the effect size may be lower and the rate of
medication side effects higher in children with ASD.
Preliminary data suggested that intranasal therapy with neuropeptide oxytocin may improve social functioning in children with ASD,
particularly those with low pretreatment oxytocin levels, but a recent
randomized trial did not demonstrate any effect of oxytocin on social
or cognitive functioning.
There is evidence to support the use of stimulant medications,
atomoxetine, and α-­agonists for ADHD in ASD. Selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can be used for anxiety and OCD and in
adolescents may also be useful for depression. Benzodiazepines may
be useful for situational anxiety, for example, triggered by dental and
medical procedures or air travel. Medications used to treat ADHD and
anxiety may result in activation or irritability in ASD and require careful monitoring.
Melatonin can be used to improve sleep onset but will not address
night waking. Clonidine or trazodone may be used for sleep onset and
maintenance. No medications are specifically labeled for treatment of
insomnia in ASD.
The α-­adrenergic agonists may be helpful in children who present with significant behavioral dysregulation. There are two atypical
antipsychotic medications that have U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendation for irritability and aggression in
children with ASD. Both risperidone and aripiprazole have several
studies documenting efficacy for reducing irritability, aggression,
and self-­injury. Secondary improvements in attention and repetitive behavior were also noted. Side effects include weight gain and
metabolic syndrome, as well as tardive dyskinesia and extrapyramidal movements. Careful laboratory monitoring is recommended.
Mood-­stabilizing antiepileptic medications have also been used to
treat irritability.

Chapter 59 u Fragile X Syndromes
Complementary and Alternative Medicine

Families of children with ASD often use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approaches. These treatments can include
supplements, dietary changes, and body or physical treatments. There
is limited evidence to inform families, who often learn about these
treatments from friends and family members, alternative medicine
providers, or the internet. For most therapies, evidence is insufficient
to show benefit. There is strong evidence that secretin and facilitated
communication are not effective. Some therapies, such as hyperbaric
oxygen, chelation, and high-­dose vitamins, are potentially harmful. For
children with restrictive diets, taking a daily multivitamin and 400 IU
vitamin D may be indicated, although there is no evidence to support
megadoses of vitamins. Similarly, for children with evidence of gluten
sensitivity, a trial of a gluten-­free diet may be indicated. However, current evidence does not support this as a treatment for all children with
ASD. There is an interest in the use of cannabidiol (CBD) to treat core
autism symptoms or co-­occurring problems such as anxiety, ADHD,
or sleep problems, but there is currently no evidence to support this
therapy.
When discussing CAM with a family, it is best to use open and
collaborative communication, encouraging them to share their current practices and any questions. Specifically ask if they use any
herbal treatments, supplements, or other therapies, such as acupuncture, massage, or chiropractic treatment, and what they have
observed since trying the treatment. Provide accurate information
regarding potential benefit and risk for any treatment. Educate
about “red flags” such as treatments that are marketed as a cure for
multiple conditions, that report no risk of side effects, or that are
marketed by the clinician recommending the treatment. Encourage
families to identify a target symptom, “try one thing at a time,” and
monitor response carefully.

Transition

Navigating a successful transition to adult care is a key role for the
pediatric provider. This process should ideally start as early as age
12-­13 years. Parents are faced with a complex and disconnected system of diverse agencies that they need to navigate. Use of structured-­
visit templates and care coordinators can help ensure that families
and their youth with ASD are able to make appropriate decisions
about secondary and postsecondary educational programming,
vocational training, guardianship, finances, housing, and medical
care. High school educational programming should include individualized and meaningful vocational training, as well as instruction regarding sexuality, relationships, safety—particularly internet
safety and abuse prevention—finances, travel training, and general
self-­advocacy. More than half of young adults with ASD remain
unemployed and unenrolled in higher education 2 years after high
school graduation. Individuals with ASD who are of average cognitive intellectual functioning will need help accessing supports for
college or postsecondary skills training and may benefit from referral to their state vocational rehabilitative services and personal life
coaches or counselors. Families who have adult children with more
significant cognitive disability need information about the range
of adult disability services; how to apply for supplemental security
income (SSI); and the process for considering guardianship, medical and financial conservatorship, or supported decision making for
their adult child. These decisions are complex and must be individualized for the adult with ASD and the family.

OUTCOME

ASD is a lifelong condition. Although a minority of individuals no
longer meet criteria for the diagnosis, most will make progress but
continue to have some impairment in social, behavioral, learning,
language, or emotional functioning as adults. Adult outcome studies are sobering, indicating that many adults with ASD are socially
isolated, lack gainful employment or independent living, and have
higher rates of depression and anxiety. It is not clear if these data

383

can be extrapolated to younger children currently receiving intensive educational therapies. There is a growing network of adult
self-­advocates who promote the unique strengths in individuals
with ASD. Outcome, as measured by developmental progress and
functional independence, is better for individuals who have higher
cognitive and language skills and lower ASD severity at initial
diagnosis.

Fragile X Syndromes
Amanda E. Bennett and Marcy Schuster
Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic disorder associated with
intellectual, learning, and behavioral symptoms and some specific
physical characteristics. In FXS an expansion of >200 CGG repeats
on the distal long arm of chromosome Xq27.3 silences the FMR1
gene, which leads to a deficiency in fragile X mental retardation
protein (FMRP) and affects synaptic function throughout much of
the brain. It is the most common heritable cause of intellectual disability and has a prevalence rate of approximately 1 in 4,000 males
and 1 in 7,000 females. Like many X-­linked disorders, males with
fragile X tend to present with more features and more significant
impairments than females.
On average, unaffected individuals have 30 CGG repeats in the
untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. Those with 55-­200 repeats are
described as having the premutation. Females with the premutation are
at increased risk of expansion of the number of CGG repeats causing
FXS in their children (Table 59.1). When males with the premutation
alleles pass them to daughters, they typically remain as premutation
alleles. Those with premutation alleles may also have clinical manifestations (Tables 59.2 and 59.3).
Fragile XE syndrome (FRAXE) resembles FXS and manifests
within a variable spectrum of intellectual and learning disabilities.
The involved gene (AFF2) results in an expansion of CCG trinucleotide repeats and is inherited as an X-­linked disorder. Symptoms also
include aggressive behaviors, agitation, autistic behaviors, clumsiness, and delayed speech and language development. This form of
FXS will not usually be detected with standard fragile X testing.

EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS

The phenotype of FXS early in life can be nonspecific with symptoms such as developmental delay, including motor and language
delays, and autistic-­like behaviors, such as repetitive motor mannerisms, sensory sensitivities, and deficits in eye contact. Manifestations in early to middle childhood often include problems
with learning, attention-­deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
anxiety, and aggressive behaviors. The physical features become
more pronounced during or after puberty and include macro-­
orchidism, hyperextensible finger joints, and characteristic facial
features, including a long face, large ears, and a prominent square
jaw (Fig. 59.1). Females affected with FXS show varying degrees
of intellectual disability and/or learning disabilities, and they may
present with symptoms of ADHD and anxiety as well.
Children with FXS are at increased risk for ophthalmologic, feeding, and orthopedic problems, as well as recurrent otitis media in
early childhood. Females are at increased risk for precocious puberty.

Adolescents should be monitored for seizures and heart murmurs, and
adults with FXS are at increased risk for mitral valve prolapse. Adults
are also at risk for intention tremor and ataxia and premature menopause, which can also occur in those with the premutation. Table 59.3
includes phenotypic features, clinical signs, and their typical age of
onset.

Family History and Premutation Carriers

Collecting a detailed family history can help identify potential risk
factors for FXS. Individuals with premutation triplet repeat expansions have been found to have a variety of clinical manifestations.
Fragile X–associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that most commonly affects

VARIATION TYPE

males over age 50 years. Females are less commonly affected and
tend to have mild disease. Symptoms include an intention tremor
followed by ataxia that may manifest as needing support when
walking or with a wide-­based gait. Females with premutation triple repeat expansions are at risk for developing fragile X–associated premature ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). Women with this
condition undergo menopause approximately 5 years earlier than
women without the condition, but symptoms are variable, with the
most severely affected experiencing irregular or absent menstrual
periods before age 40 and often infertility. A variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms, including anxiety, ADHD, social deficits, or autism
spectrum disorder (ASD), have also been associated with the premutation. Asking about family members for a history of developmental, behavioral, or learning problems or adult family members
with early menopause, fertility challenges, or adult-­onset neurologic problems may help to identify risk for a positive fragile X test
in a child with developmental or behavioral concerns. Asymptomatic siblings or other family members may benefit from testing to
determine premutation status, which can also be associated with the
symptoms noted earlier. See Table 59.3 for additional information
about clinical symptoms in premutation carriers.

Diagnostic Testing

A diagnosis of FXS is possible through PCR and Southern blot
analysis of a patient’s blood. Positive DNA testing shows an expansion of >200 trinucleotide CGG repeats inside an area of the FMR1
gene on the X chromosome. Diagnostic testing that reports methylation status of the gene region is preferred because methylation
status is inversely correlated with cognitive functioning. Because
the physical features of FXS are not always apparent in early childhood, diagnostic testing is recommended for any child who presents with global developmental delay, intellectual disability, or ASD
(see Chapters 56 and 58). Any positive test for fragile X should
include genetic counseling to inform of inheritance risk, phenotypic variability, and medical conditions associated with FXS and
premutation status. Specific gene (AFF2) testing for FRAXE should
be considered if CGG repeat testing is negative.

MANAGEMENT OF FRAGILE X SYNDROME

Management of FXS in children often requires a multidisciplinary
approach focused on monitoring for and managing developmental
and/or behavioral symptoms. In addition to health supervision visits
with a primary care clinician, many children with FXS benefit from
ongoing care with a medical professional with experience or knowledge of FXS. Families will also benefit from accessing educational and
behavioral health resources in the community.

Educational

Many individuals with FXS will require educational support to meet
their needs starting from a young age. Early intervention services,
including speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy,
and special instruction, are often vital components of addressing developmental delays. As a child ages and ongoing assessment
occurs, special education support through an individualized education plan (IEP) may be warranted (See Chapter 49). There are
interventions shown to be specific to the learning needs of individuals with FXS. Biologic males typically demonstrate strengths in
receptive language, verbal labeling, simultaneous processing, imitation, and daily living activities. Biologic females typically demonstrate areas of strength in vocabulary, comprehension, reading,
writing, spelling, and short-­term visual memory. These advantages
should be explored when educational interventions are being developed. Areas often in need of interventions for individuals with FXS
include improving complex problem solving, maintaining attention, improving impulse control, understanding spatial relationships, and math concepts.
Environmental modifications and adaptive technologies can be
an asset for an individual with FXS. This can include a modified
keyboard and/or mouse and touch-­screen computer options integrated into classroom lessons. A quiet environment with minimal
distractions can help improve focus on tasks. Small group and one-­
on-­one instruction for teaching new tasks can minimize anxiety and
improve generalization of skills to the larger classroom. Teaching
students to request breaks when feeling overwhelmed can minimize
overall frustration. Visual schedules, manipulatives, clutter-­
f ree
areas, and social stories are all interventions to improve compliance
and learning.

Behavioral

Individuals with FXS can present with a variety of cognitive and
behavioral challenges. ASD is diagnosed in between 50% and 60%
of individuals with FXS. ASD is characterized by deficits in communication and social skills along with restricted interests and/or
repetitive behaviors that interfere with one’s daily life (see Chapter
58). Individuals with FXS can struggle with making eye contact,
engaging in conversations, and expressing wants and needs. Often
individuals with FXS want social contact but may avoid it due to
anxiety. Hyperarousal is a common behavioral symptom, particularly in social situations where eye contact is expected, suggesting
the presence of significant sensory aversions. Behavioral interventions that include skill development and anxiety management can
be helpful in addressing social skills deficits. Other sensory-­aversive
behaviors can be related to auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli. Tantrums, and occasionally aggression, can emerge when children with
FXS are overstimulated.
Sensory-­seeking behaviors can also be present in individuals with
FXS. These may include repetitive movements, narrowed interests,
rigid routines, and atypical sensory exploration. Behaviors such as
rocking, pacing, and jumping could occur to obtain sensory input.
Individuals with FXS can become extremely anxious if a routine is
changed or if a preferred activity is interrupted. Teaching coping strategies along with the recognition of triggers for anxiety can be helpful as
a behavior management strategy.
Individuals with FXS can present with deficits in attention and
focus, impulsivity, and/or hyperactivity, particularly during childhood. This can lead to a diagnosis of ADHD (see Chapter 50).
These deficits can affect learning in school and require specialized

instruction or classroom accommodations to help improve focus
and participation.
Individuals with FXS can present with aggressive behavior directed
toward themselves and toward others. These behaviors are seen in
approximately 50% of males with FXS and tend to increase with age.
Individuals who exhibit ongoing aggression also typically present with
more significant intellectual impairment, communication delays, and
anxiety. Aggression can put a strain on caregivers or lead to injury and
therefore often emerges as a primary focus of treatment.
Behavior management techniques vary depending on a child’s needs.
If an ASD diagnosis is present, applied behavioral analysis (ABA) programs are often integrated into treatment. ABA promotes multiple
areas of development, including language, emotion, and cognition.
ABA focuses on tracking specific behaviors through observation and
data collection, learning their antecedents (the event or environment
before the behavior occurred), and managing their consequences (the
response others have after the behavior occurs) through a structured
approach. Most interventions for unwanted behaviors (e.g., aggression
or self-­injury) aim to change the antecedents to reduce the likelihood
of the behavior occurring or to change the consequence in order to
make the behavior less rewarding for the individual. Interventions that
aim to increase a desired behavior (e.g., complying with an instruction
or toilet training) will incorporate environmental changes to remind
and encourage the behavior and identify rewarding consequences that
can be delivered after the behavior has occurred. ABA interventions
delivered during daily living activities, community participation, and
family interactions allow for optimal skill development. Special education programs often include similar behavior management techniques
throughout the early childhood for individuals with FXS.

Medical

In addition to educational and behavioral management, many children with FXS may present with certain medical conditions and
may require additional monitoring or care by a specialist (see Table
59.3). Monitoring in infancy and early childhood should emphasize assessment for orthopedic, growth, and/or feeding concerns.
Because young children with FXS are more susceptible to otitis
media and may lack communication skills to convey discomfort,
a full physical examination, including ear examination, is recommended if a child presents with acute behavior changes. Young
children should also be routinely screened for ophthalmologic

problems, such as strabismus or astigmatism, and monitored for
symptoms related to connective tissue problems, such as hypermobile joints or inguinal hernias. Seizures are more prevalent in children with FXS; symptoms concerning for any type of seizure should
be investigated with electroencephalogram (EEG) when the child
is both awake and asleep. Although risk for mitral valve prolapse is
not typically increased until adulthood, examination for murmurs,
clicks, or changes in blood pressure should be performed regularly.
Sleep disturbances commonly reported among children with FXS
include delayed sleep onset, frequent night waking, and occasionally obstructive sleep apnea. Screening for sleep concerns should be
done at every visit, and parents should be counseled on behavioral
strategies to address sleep onset and waking challenges (see Chapter
31). Concerns for apnea or snoring may require further evaluation
by a sleep specialist or with polysomnography. Medications to help
address sleep concerns may include melatonin or clonidine, neither
of which is currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children with FXS.
There are currently no approved treatments for the core symptoms of FXS, but many individuals will benefit from medication to
address some of the commonly co-­occurring behavioral symptoms
associated with absence of FMRP. If behavioral strategies are not
sufficient to address hyperactivity or impulsivity, a young child (<5
years) may benefit from a trial of an α2-­adrenergic agonist, such
as clonidine or guanfacine. School-­aged children with FXS often
show improvements in hyperactivity, impulsivity, and/or attention
problems when treated with a stimulant, but side effects such as
irritability or aggression may occur. Selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs) can be safe and effective in reducing anxiety,
obsessive-­
compulsive symptoms, and sometimes aggression in
young children with FXS; one trial of sertraline in young children
with FXS demonstrated improvements in visual reception and fine
motor coordination in 2-­to 6-­year-­olds. Additional analyses demonstrated improvements in expressive language skills for children
with FXS and ASD. Treatment with an atypical antipsychotic, such
as risperidone or aripiprazole, may be needed in cases of severe
anxiety, aggression, or mood instability that have not responded to
other medications.
Neurobiologic studies of FXS have identified overactivation
of brain glutamate pathways and underactivation of gamma-­
aminobutyric acid (GABA) pathways leading to studies of

Nutrition
Chapter 60

Nutritional Requirements
Martine Saint-­Cyr, Stephanie W. Waldrop,
and Nancy F. Krebs
Nutrition for infants, children, and adolescents should maintain current weight and support normal growth and development. Growth
during infancy is rapid, critical for neurocognitive development, and
has the highest energy and nutrient requirements relative to body size
compared with any other period of growth. It is followed by growth
during childhood, when 60% of total growth occurs, and finally by
puberty. Nutrition and growth during the first 3 years of life predict adult stature and some health outcomes. Although the antecedents are numerous and occur earlier, the major risk period for linear
growth faltering or stunting (length-­or height-­for-­age z score ≤-2)
is between 6 and 24 months of age. Therefore it is critical to identify
nutrient deficiencies promptly and to address them aggressively early
in life, because missing them can impart lasting adverse effects on later
growth and development.
Dietary intake should meet energy requirements, as well as provide
the essential macronutrients and micronutrients needed for sustaining the function of multiple vital processes. Nutrient deficiencies can
limit growth, impair immune function, affect neurodevelopment, and
increase morbidity and mortality. Worldwide, malnutrition and undernutrition are the leading causes of acquired immunodeficiency and a
major factor underlying morbidity and mortality in children <5 years
of age.
The transition in food supply and the type of nutrition chosen in
many developing countries from a traditional to Western diet has
resulted in increased life expectancy and adult stature. It is associated
with decreases in the incidence of communicable diseases. Unfortunately, the Western diet, characterized by high energy density, more
refined grains, and highly processed foods, is also frequently accompanied by decreased physical activity and increases in the incidence and
prevalence of noncommunicable diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular (CV) disease, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
and certain cancers. Consequently, it is important to view the impact
of diet and nutrition on health from various perspectives: to prevent
deficiency, to promote adequacy, and to prevent or reduce the risk for
acquiring diseases associated with excess intakes, such as obesity, diabetes, and CV disease.
Advances in our understanding of the roles of some nutrients such
as vitamin D, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and fiber have
changed our focus from recommendations about preventing deficiency
to recommendations about nutritional intake associated with optimal
health. The 2006 World Health Organization (WHO) growth charts,
recommended for all infants and children until age 2 years, are not only
descriptive but also prescriptive on how children with adequate nutrition and healthcare should grow. Identifying and providing appropriate and adequate nutrition in infancy and childhood are critical to
supporting normal growth and development, as well as providing the
foundation for lifelong health and well-­being.

DIETARY REFERENCE INTAKES

average requirement (EAR), the recommended dietary allowance
(RDA), and the tolerable upper limit of intake (UL) (Figs. 60.1 and
60.2). In addition, the concept of the DRI is also applicable to the estimated energy requirement (EER) and the acceptable macronutrient
distribution range (AMDR).
The EAR is an estimated average of the daily nutrient intake required
to meet the nutritional needs of 50% of the population; it is applied
to the assessment of a population’s intake. The RDA provides an estimate of the minimum daily average intake for a nutrient that meets the
nutritional needs for more than 97% of individuals in a population, and
it can be used as a guideline for individuals to avoid deficiency. When
an EAR cannot be derived, an RDA cannot be calculated; therefore an
adequate intake (AI) is developed as a guideline for individuals based
on the best available data and scientific consensus. The UL denotes the
highest average daily intake with no associated adverse health effects
for almost all individuals in a given population. Figure 60.2 shows the
relationships among EAR, RDA, and UL.

ENERGY

Energy balance constitutes both caloric intake, most often derived
from food, and metabolic caloric expenditure. An imbalance between
energy intake and energy expenditure can lead to undesirable health
consequences. Inadequate energy intake can lead to weight faltering,
catabolism of body tissues (e.g., fat and muscle), diminished immunity, and increased morbidity and mortality. For infants, children,
and adolescents, acute or chronic energy deficits can adversely affect

to be close to 0.0. At intakes above the UL, the potential risk of adverse

motor, cognitive, and behavioral development. Excess energy intake
can increase the risk for obesity and obesity-­related metabolic disease.
Energy balance in adults is associated with maintenance of weight status. Positive energy balance is required in children to support growth.
Components of energy expenditure in adults include the basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is primarily determined by lean body mass; the
thermal effect of food (e.g., energy required for digestion and absorption); energy for thermoregulation; and energy for physical activity.
Energy needs are increased during infancy, childhood, pregnancy, and
lactation, necessitating increased energy intakes during these life stages.
The 2020–2025 DGA provides important nutrition and health topics applicable to each life stage, including data on estimates of caloric
intake for healthy persons. The exact daily caloric requirement varies
according to an individual’s age, gender, height, weight, and physical
activity, among other factors. Weight loss, weight maintenance, and
weight gain depend on calories consumed and calories expended in
the context of caloric needs.
The estimated energy requirement (EER) for infants, children, and
adolescents is the average dietary energy intake predicted to maintain
energy balance, ensure adequate growth and development, and provide
for a desirable level of physical activity. It considers age, gender, weight,
stature, and level of physical activity (see Table 60.1). The EER was
determined based on empirical research in healthy persons at different
levels of physical activity and is estimated by equations that account
for both total energy expenditure (TEE) and energy deposition (ED) for
healthy growth. EERs for infants, relative to body weight, are approximately twice those for adults because of the increased metabolic rate
and energy requirements for weight maintenance and growth.
The EER was not devised for, and does not necessarily apply to,
children with acute or chronic diseases who may have altered energy
requirements due to chronic infection or inflammation, malabsorption, febrile illnesses, chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease,
or other conditions. In these situations, energy requirements are
typically higher when compared with healthy matched peers. Conversely, in some conditions, individuals may be hypometabolic and
thus require less energy than expected (e.g., hypothyroidism, hypothalamic obesity conditions, Down syndrome, and certain syndromic
or monogenic obesity disorders). Individual energy needs for healthy
persons based on age, gender, height, weight, activity level, pregnancy, or lactation status can be approximated using online tools,
such as the DRI Calculator for Healthcare Professionals, available at
https://www.nal.usda.gov/human-­nutrition-­and-­food-­s afety/dri-­
calculator.
Dietary nutrients that provide energy include fats (approximately 9
kcal/g), carbohydrates (4 kcal/g), and protein (4 kcal/g). These nutrients are called macronutrients. If alcohol is consumed, it also contributes to energy intake (7 kcal/g). The EER does not specify the relative
energy contributions of macronutrients. Once the minimal intake of
each macronutrient is attained (e.g., sufficient protein intake to meet
specific amino acid requirements, sufficient fat intake to meet linoleic
acid and α-­linolenic acid needs for brain development), the remainder
of the intake is used to meet energy requirements, with some degree of
freedom and interchangeability among fat, carbohydrate, and protein.
This forms the basis for the acceptable macronutrient distribution
ranges (AMDRs), expressed as a function of total energy intake (see
Table 60.2).

FAT

Fat is the most calorically dense macronutrient, providing approximately 9 kcal/g. For infants, human milk and formula are the main
dietary sources of fat, whereas older children obtain fat from animal
products, vegetable oils, margarine, and nuts and seeds. The AMDR for
fats is 30–40% of total energy intake for children 1-­3 years and 25–35%
for children 4-­18 years of age. In addition to being energy dense, lipids provide essential fatty acids that have structural and functional
roles (e.g., cholesterol moieties are precursors for cell membranes,
hormones, and bile acids). Fat intake also facilitates absorption of fat-­
soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E, and K). Both roles are relevant to
neurologic and ocular development (see Table 60.3).

392 Part V u Nutrition
Dietary fats include phospholipids; free fatty acids; monoglycerides,
diglycerides, and triglycerides; and sterols. Triglycerides are the most
common form of dietary fat and are composed of one glycerol molecule with three fatty acids. They are found in both animal and vegetable fats. In addition, simple sugars (i.e., refined grains and high-­sugar
drinks) can be converted to triglycerides in the liver. In general, dietary
fatty acids can be classified as saturated, unsaturated, and more specifically, as monounsaturated or polyunsaturated. Dietary saturated fatty
acids, found primarily in animal fat and dairy products as well as some
vegetable fats (e.g., coconut and palm oil), can be synthesized endogenously by the body and thus are not required in the diet. Medium-­
chain triglycerides (e.g., MCT oil) are beneficial for those suffering
from malabsorptive disorders resulting in steatorrhea because of their
direct absorption from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract into the bloodstream via the portal vein, bypassing the need for pancreatic and biliary
secretory components. The dietary saturated fatty acids most commonly consumed include myristic (C14), palmitic (C16), and steric
acid (C18).
Trans fatty acids are a type of unsaturated fat having undergone
hydrogenation that alters the configuration of its double bond(s). They
are found primarily in processed foods such as margarines and shortenings and are nonessential. A small amount of naturally occurring
trans fats can be found in animal products and human breast milk.
Monounsaturated fatty acids are typically found in certain plants and
their derived oils (e.g., avocado oil, olive oil, canola) and in some animal fats. Because monounsaturated fatty acids can be synthesized by
the liver, they are considered nonessential to the diet. Polyunsaturated
fatty acids (PUFAs) are fatty acids not able to be synthesized de novo
in the body and are necessary for maintenance of growth, skin integrity, aspects of central nervous system development, and other essential physiologic functions such as regulation of gene transcription,

immunity, and inflammation. These dietary essential fatty acids include
linoleic (C18:2,W6,9) and linolenic acid (C18:3,W3,6,9), and they are
discussed in more detail later.
Neither monounsaturated nor polyunsaturated fatty acids contribute adversely to plasma cholesterol levels. However, dietary saturated
fatty acids (found primarily in animal fat and dairy products), trans fats
(found in hydrogenated margarines and oils), and cholesterol increase
the low-­density lipoprotein (LDL) fraction of serum cholesterol, which
is a risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. Autopsy studies demonstrate that atherosclerosis begins early in childhood, even
in infancy. Therefore dietary advice to optimize CV health should be
given starting from age 2 years, when sufficient fat intake to sustain
growth and brain development is less of a concern. It is recommended
that saturated fat make up less than 10% of total daily calories in
the diet for those age 2 years and above, with increased focus on consumption of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Dietary trans
fatty acids are to be avoided, particularly artificial trans fatty acids in
the form of partially hydrogenated oils, which are no longer considered Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). Figure 60.3 shows the dietary contributions of
saturated fat for those age 1 year and above.
Because saturated and monounsaturated fats can be synthesized
endogenously to support adequate structural and physiologic requirements, there is no AI or RDA set for these dietary components. Trans
fats, which have no known health benefits in humans, also do not have
an AI or RDA defined. A UL has not been set for cholesterol, saturated,
or trans fats because there is a continuous positive linear association
between intake of these fats and increased risk for CV disease, without
a threshold level. Diets low in saturated fats without trans fats are therefore preferred. For optimal CV health in the general population,
rather than limiting fat intake, advice should focus in most cases

Chapter 60 u Nutritional Requirements
on changing the type of fat consumed. Because of their high energy
density, excessive intake of all types of fatty acids has the potential to
increase the risk of obesity.
Humans are incapable of synthesizing the precursor ω3 (α-­linolenic
acid [ALA]) and ω6 (linoleic acid [LA]) long-­chain PUFAs and depend
on diet for these two essential fatty acids. Walnut, canola, and flaxseed
oil are good sources of ALA. Good sources of LA include safflower
and sunflower oil. Essential fatty acids are enzymatically elongated
and desaturated into longer-­chain fatty acids (LC-­PUFAs) that serve
essential physiologic roles in the body. ALA can be converted to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). LA is converted to arachidonic acid (ARA). The conversion of ALA to EPA and
DHA and of LA to ARA is influenced by many factors, including type
and amounts of dietary fats and by enzymatic substrate affinity among
competing ω3, ω6, ω9, saturated, and trans fatty acids. Approximately
0.5% of dietary ALA is converted to DHA, and 5% of ALA intake is
converted to EPA; therefore dietary intake of LC-­PUFAs is an important determinant of serum and tissue DHA and EPA status.
LC-­PUFAs such as DHA and ARA have a variety of cellular structural and functional roles; they influence membrane fluidity and gene
expression and modulate the inflammatory response. ARA and DHA
are present in breast milk and reflect maternal intake. They are often
supplemented in infant formulas and are important for optimal growth
and development. DHA is highly concentrated in the retina and is
involved in the visual evoked response in infants.
Risk factors for essential fatty acid deficiency (i.e., deficiency
of ALA and LA) include severe fat malabsorption, prematurity, and
administration of fat-­free parenteral nutrition. Deficiency can develop
within 2-­4 weeks of inadequate intake. Essential fatty acid deficiency
of LA is associated with desquamating skin rashes, alopecia, thrombocytopenia, impaired immunity, and growth deficits, but is rare in
the general population. Deficiency of ALA has been associated with
paresthesias, weakness, impaired gait, impaired vision, hemorrhagic
folliculitis, and impaired wound healing.
The biologic activity and health benefits of ALA are thought to be
derived from its elongation products EPA and DHA. Consistent with
the findings of limited conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA, the DRI
stipulates that up to 10% of the AI for ω3 PUFA (ALA being the major
dietary constituent) can be replaced by DHA and EPA to support normal neural development and growth. The ratio of dietary intake of each
type of PUFA influences their relative amounts in different tissue compartments. A dietary ω6:ω3 PUFA ratio of 4-­5:1 may be associated
with improved health outcomes, compared with the current 15-­30:1
ratio typically observed in U.S. diets. In general, ω6 fatty acids tend
to have more proinflammatory effects and ω3 fatty acids more antiinflammatory effects, which have potential implications for adjunctive
nutritional management of chronic inflammatory conditions.

PROTEIN

Protein and amino acids have structural and functional roles in every
cell in the body. Dietary protein intake is required to maintain and
replenish the turnover of protein and to meet amino acid needs for
growth. Dietary protein also provides approximately 4 kcal/g as an
energy substrate when intake is in excess of needs or derived from
endogenous sources during periods of catabolism. Inadequate energy
intake or inadequate protein intake increases catabolism of body protein reservoirs (i.e., lean body mass) for energy and free amino acids
required to support normal physiologic function. Without adequate
daily dietary protein intake, endogenous sources will be mobilized at
the expense of function. Negative energy balance (weight loss) is associated with an obligatory negative nitrogen balance. Nitrogen from
protein turnover is primarily excreted in urine and stool.
Increased protein intake of up to 20–30% may be required during
hypermetabolic states, as well as in those infants and children recovering from malnutrition. Certain conditions may require a modest
increase in protein intake, including conditions with high protein
turnover, such as cystic fibrosis, inflammatory conditions, critical illnesses, extensive burn injuries, compensated liver disease, and postsurgical states including bariatric surgery (e.g., laparoscopic sleeve

393

gastrectomy and Roux-­en-­Y gastric bypass). Premature infants also
require increased protein intakes due to increased needs related to
accelerated growth rates. In addition, athletes engaging in resistance,
muscle-­building training may have increased total protein needs of
approximately 1.2-­2.0 g/kg/day to prevent loss of lean body mass
and to maintain nitrogen balance. Importantly, the increased protein intake in these situations must occur in the context of adequate
energy intake in order for protein deposition to occur, thus ensuring that protein is not used or catabolized for energy. Moderate to
severe protein-­energy malnutrition (PEM), although relatively rare
in the non-institutionalized U.S. population, is more common in low-­
resource settings. Mild PEM occurs more commonly in the United
States, leading children not to meet weight targets on growth curves.
PEM impairs brain, immune system, and intestinal mucosal functions (see Chapters 62 and 64).
The DRI for protein is provided in Table 60.3. Numerous factors
influence dietary requirements for protein, including gender, age,
growth stage, pregnancy, lactation, the presence of illness, the nutritional adequacy of an individual’s diet, and genetics. The most important determinant of protein requirements is energy intake because
insufficient energy intake will lead to protein catabolism to maintain
energy balance, effectively increasing protein intake requirements.
The EAR and RDA take into account protein required for growth and
maintenance, but the RDA accounts for variation in requirements for a
particular population that may exist as a result of differences in maintenance needs, protein accrual rates, and the efficiency of dietary protein
accrual. Thus the RDA exceeds the EAR and most protein needs for
individuals of a specific group.
The average intake of protein from poultry, meat, eggs, nuts, seeds,
and soy products differs by age and gender. According to the 2020–
2025 DGA and based on National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) data from 2015 to 2016, the average daily intake of
protein for males and females age 2-­4 years and 5-­8 years is within recommended ranges. In children age 9-­13 years, average protein intake
barely meets the lower end of recommended intake for both males and
females. For adolescents 14 years of age and above, males have average
daily protein intakes within the recommended range; that for females
falls short of the minimum recommended daily intake. A UL for protein has not been set because of insufficient data; however, excessively
high intakes can result in increased urinary calcium excretion that may
increase the risk of renal calculi. Intake of protein or specific amino
acids needs to be limited in some health conditions, such as renal disease, decompensated liver disease, and metabolic diseases such as phenylketonuria and maple syrup urine disease, in which specific amino
acids can be toxic. Conclusive evidence for harm in otherwise healthy
individuals from high protein intakes is lacking. Protein intake necessary to meet micronutrient needs, especially during the first 2 years of
postnatal life, will typically exceed recommended protein intakes, thus
requiring micronutrient supplementation to prevent insufficiency or
deficiency.
The amino acid content of dietary protein is also important. The
standard by which a protein’s quality is judged is its ability to support
adequate growth. Certain amino acids are indispensable/essential, and
humans depend on dietary sources to meet adequacy and prevent deficiency. Certain amino acids are termed conditionally indispensable,
meaning they can be endogenously produced but require an exogenous
source (i.e., diet) in certain disease conditions or during a certain life
stage. An example would be the increased requirements for cysteine,
tyrosine, and arginine in newborns because of enzyme immaturity
(Table 60.4). DRI recommendations regarding protein intake assume
adequate provision of indispensable amino acids and high digestibility.
Human milk contains both the indispensable and conditionally indispensable amino acids and therefore meets the protein requirements for
infants. Breast milk is considered the optimal protein source for infants
and is the reference amino acid composition by which biologic quality is determined for infants. If a single amino acid in a food protein
source is low or absent but is required to support normal metabolism,
that specific amino acid becomes the limiting nutrient in that food.
Animal protein, unlike plant protein, contains sufficient indispensable

amino acids and typically is more digestible (>95%) than plant-­source
proteins (70–80%).
To ensure appropriate growth and to promote satiety, children
should consume the recommended amount of protein. Specific recommendations for appropriate dietary protein sources to meet indispensable amino acid requirements are available for groups adopting specific
diets, such as vegetarians and vegans. Including mixtures of protein
sources (e.g., legumes and corn) and using a variety of food sources
to provide all of the required amino acids are strategies advocated for
vegetarians and vegans (see Chapter 61).

CARBOHYDRATES

Carbohydrates are abundant in many foods, including cereals, grains,
fruits, and vegetables, and provide approximately 4 kcal/g of energy.
Dietary carbohydrates include monosaccharides, which contain one
sugar molecule (e.g., glucose, fructose, galactose); disaccharides,
which contain two sugar molecules (e.g., sucrose, lactose, maltose);
oligosaccharides or polysaccharides, which contain multiple sugar
molecules in a chain or complex configuration (e.g., starch, nonstarch
polysaccharides like fiber); and sugar alcohols. Dietary carbohydrates
are absorbed across the intestinal epithelium and converted to glucose
in the liver. Glucose serves as the essential energy source for erythrocytes and the central nervous system and is a major energy source
for all other cells. The requirements for carbohydrates are based on
the average minimum amount of glucose used by the brain. Chronic
low carbohydrate intake (e.g., less than 10% of total caloric intake)
results in ketosis. Although a UL for carbohydrates has not been set,
a maximal intake of <10% of total energy intake from added sugars,
such as syrups and other caloric sweeteners, has been proposed in the
2020–2025 DGA.
Added sugars do not contribute essential nutrients and function
to sweeten foods and beverages. Naturally occurring sugars, such as
in milk (lactose) or fruits (fructose), are not included. Higher intakes
of added sugar can displace other macronutrients and micronutrients and increase the risk for nutrient deficiency and excessive energy
intake. There is no benefit from consuming added sugars as discretionary calorie intake. The excess calories from added sugars may displace
more nutrient-­dense foods and make it difficult to meet nutrient needs
while remaining within the recommended total caloric intake.
The recommended AMDR for carbohydrates is based on data suggesting a risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) with diets high in
refined carbohydrates and low in fat (see Table 60.2). These diets, compared with diets with higher fat intake, result in high triglyceride levels,
low high-­density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and small LDL cholesterol particles and are associated with an increased risk of CAD, especially in sedentary overweight individuals. Diets within the AMDR
for carbohydrates and fats minimize the risks of diabetes, obesity, and
CAD. Diets with less than the minimum AMDR for carbohydrate most
likely do not meet the AI for fiber (see Table 60.3).

Most carbohydrates are present as starches or sugars in food. Simple sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides) are often added to
foods and beverages during food preparation, processing, and packaging to enhance their palatability and also act as preservatives. Sugar-­
sweetened beverages, including nondiet soft drinks, juice drinks, iced
tea, and sport drinks, are major contributors to added sugars in the diet
of U.S. children and adolescents (Fig. 60.4). Added sugars are associated with increased risk for obesity, diabetes, and dental caries. Fructose is one such added sugar in the form of high-­fructose corn syrup,
which is ubiquitous in the U.S. diet. Added fructose increases HDL
and triglyceride production in the liver and serum uric acid, which
increases systolic blood pressure and is associated with nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease and metabolic syndrome. Excessive fructose intake,
such as in the form of fruit juices, may be associated with diarrhea,
abdominal pain, and failure to thrive in children. Fructose consumed
in whole fruits rarely contributes to these side effects because its systemic absorption and metabolic effects are mitigated by the fact that it
is complexed with fiber.
The glycemic index is a measure of peak blood glucose concentration 2 hours after ingestion of a given food compared with a reference
standard (slice of white bread). The glycemic index has predictable
effects on blood glucose, hemoglobin A1C, insulin, triglycerides, and
HDL cholesterol. Lower-­glycemic-­index foods are recommended and
may reduce the risk of insulin resistance and CV disease. Examples of
low-­glycemic-­index foods include oat bran, muesli, barley, carrots,
nonstarchy vegetables, and most fruits.

FIBER

Fiber consists of nondigestible carbohydrates (i.e., nonstarch polysaccharides and nonpolysaccharides such as lignins), mostly derived from
plant sources, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, that escape
digestion and reach the colon almost 100% intact. Fiber can be classified as fermentable and nonfermentable. Fermentable fibers are found
in beans, fruits, and products containing oats or psyllium, and nonfermentable fiber is found in whole grains and vegetables. The DRI
classification considers total fiber intake to be composed of dietary
fiber (nondigestible carbohydrates and lignins intrinsic to plants that
are fermented by colonic bacteria) and functional fiber (nondigestible
carbohydrates isolated from plants or manufactured for use as dietary
supplements). Although functional fibers may improve constipation
and glucose absorption, they do not contain the other beneficial phytochemicals and nutrients of naturally occurring fiber found in whole
foods. Functional fibers have been added to cereals, salad dressings,
soups, baked goods, and meal replacements with the aim of increasing
fiber intake.
Dietary fiber may help reduce intestinal cell dysplasia by diluting
toxins, carcinogens, and tumor promoters; decreasing transit time,
thereby reducing colonic mucosal exposure; and promoting toxin
expulsion in the fecal stream. Dietary fiber that is resistant to colonic

degradation may also play a role in maintaining and promoting stool
bulk and in regulating intraluminal pressure and colonic wall resistance, disordered colonic motility, or both. Lack of certain types of
dietary fiber is associated with constipation and diverticulosis.
All types of dietary fiber slow gastric emptying and promote satiety,
and thus may help to regulate appetite. Dietary fiber may decrease the
rate of release and absorption of simple sugars and may help regulate
blood sugar concentration by lowering postprandial blood glucose levels. Dietary fiber has a low glycemic index and may have a beneficial
effect on insulin sensitivity. Fiber also binds luminal cholesterol and
reduces absorption and enterohepatic circulation of the cholesterol in
bile salts (e.g., with the intake of more viscous forms of dietary fiber,
such as pectin). Guar gum, oat products, and pectin (i.e., fermentable/
viscous fiber) lower serum cholesterol, whereas nonfermentable/nonviscous fiber (e.g., flax, wheat bran) may reduce serum triglycerides.
Fiber such as psyllium, resistant dextrins, and resistant starch may
lower both serum LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Low fiber intake
in Western society has been associated with the increasing incidence
and prevalence of diabetes, obesity, CV disease, colon cancer, and IBD.
There is a dynamic interplay between the colonic bacterial milieu and
the diet. The metabolic fate of fiber is influenced primarily by colonic
bacteria, which render it susceptible to fermentation, depending on the
structure of the fiber (e.g., pectin, oat bran). Common by-products of
colonic fermentation include carbon dioxide, methane (in addition to
other gases), oligofructose (also known as a prebiotic, a substrate that
nourishes beneficial commensal GI microbiota), and short-­chain fatty
acids (SCFAs). The common SCFAs produced by fermentation include
acetate, butyrate, and propionate. SCFAs influence colonic physiology
by stimulating colonic blood flow and fluid and electrolyte uptake.
Butyrate is the preferred fuel for the colonocyte and may have a role in
maintaining the normal phenotype in these cells. Good sources of fiber
include beans, peas, leafy and cruciferous vegetables, fruits, and whole

grains. The observed benefits of diets rich in fruits and vegetables may
be mediated by the fiber they contain and also by the other compounds
and micronutrients (e.g., polyphenols, carotenoids) they contain.
Data are insufficient to establish an EAR for dietary fiber. AI for
dietary fiber has been established based on the intake levels associated with reducing risk for CV disease and in lowering or normalizing
serum cholesterol (see Table 60.3). Several recommendations address
dietary fiber intake in children based on body weight or as a proportion of daily calories consumed. The IOM recommends an AI for fiber
of 14 g per 1,000 kcal of energy consumed (see Table 60.3), which for
younger children may be unrealistic to achieve. The equation for the
range of recommended daily fiber intake in grams = Age (years) + 5 to 10
grams per day. The recommendations do not specify type of fiber and
predate the newer definitions of fiber.
A UL has not been established for fiber, which is not thought to be
harmful to human health. Some types of fiber, such as fermentable oligosaccharides, may exert symptoms on the basis of their digestibility,
by-­product formation, and interactions with GI microbiota. Excessive
intake of fermentable oligosaccharides (e.g., fructooligosaccharides
such as onions), disaccharides (e.g., lactose), monosaccharides (e.g.,
fructose), and polyols (e.g., sorbitol) (aka FODMAPs) is associated
with increased risk for GI symptoms along the functional abdominal
pain, functional GI disorders (IBS), and IBD. Restricted intake or
substitution with lower-­FODMAP foods may be beneficial. Substitutions within the same food groups can shift from a high-­FODMAP
diet to a low-­FODMAP diet, which may provide GI symptom relief.
For example, substituting cucumber for celery would be exchanging a
high-­FODMAP food for a low-­FODMAP food. Dietary management
for some conditions may put certain children at risk of low fiber intake.
Gluten-­free diets used for celiac disease are often low in fiber. In such
cases, gluten-­free sources of fiber should be recommended, such as
tapioca, flax, corn, rice, sorghum, and quinoa.

396 Part V u Nutrition
MICRONUTRIENTS

See Chapters 66-­72.
Vitamins and minerals, the dietary micronutrients, are essential for
growth and development and contribute to a host of physiologic functions. Many U.S. children may have suboptimal intake of iron, zinc,
potassium, calcium, and vitamins D, E, and K, and excess intake of
sodium. Dietary recommendations for micronutrients were originally
established to prevent deficiency and currently also include the impact
of micronutrients on long-­term health outcomes (Table 60.5). Food
fortification is an effective strategy to prevent some nutrient deficiencies and has been successfully implemented to prevent iodine, folate,
and vitamin D deficiencies.
The DRI for 0-­6 months for all micronutrients are AIs, because data
are considered to be insufficient to establish an EAR on which an RDA
would be based. The AI for the first 6 months of postnatal life is based
on the daily mean nutrient intake supplied by human milk for healthy,
full-­term infants who are exclusively breastfed. For approximately the
first 6 months of postnatal life for healthy term infants, an adequately
nourished mother produces human milk with adequate amounts of
the majority of micronutrients; exceptions are iron and zinc, concentrations of which are unrelated to maternal intake. In the early postnatal months, infants rely on body stores and iron available from the
relatively high erythron (especially with delayed cord clamping), and
thus the actual dietary requirement for iron is very modest. Infants
born prematurely and/or with evidence of fetal growth restriction are
likely to have low iron stores at birth and thus may need exogenous
iron earlier than 6 months. Zinc concentrations in human milk decline
sharply over the first 3-­4 months of lactation and are insufficient to
meet needs by approximately 6 months. Thus after about 6 months,
sources of both iron and zinc are required from complementary foods,
such as pureed meats, fortified foods (e.g., infant cereals), or from
supplements.

Calcium

Calcium is key to bone health. Adequacy is determined in part by bone
mineral content and bone mineral density (BMD). The main storage organs for calcium are the bones and teeth. Bone mineral accretion occurs primarily during childhood, with peak bone mass being
achieved by the second to third decade of life. Calcium recommendations include a change from an AI to RDA, in terms of strength of
evidence for recommendations, and increased UL in 9-­to 18-­year-­olds
(Table 60.6). There are no adequate biomarkers to assess calcium status
in healthy children because serum calcium is tightly regulated (regardless of intake and total body calcium) by changes in parathyroid hormone and calcitriol levels. Maintaining adequate serum calcium level
despite inadequate intake could come at the expense of BMD. Therefore
in the long term, reduced BMD could serve as a surrogate marker of
chronic calcium intake and status. It is important to note other determinants of BMD are age, gender, genetic-­ethnic factors, hormonal status, physical activity, and weight. Assessments of calcium status should
include calcium intake in the diet. It is also important to educate families on additional and alternative sources of calcium (including calcium
supplementation) if calcium intake is determined to be low.

Electrolytes

Zinc deficiency is estimated to affect millions of children in low-­
resource settings and is associated with increased risk for impaired linear growth (stunting), impaired immune function, and increased risk
for respiratory and diarrheal diseases. In high-­resource settings, mild
deficiency may occur in older infants and toddlers if dietary choices
do not include meat or fortified products. Whole grains, legumes, and
other high-­protein plant sources contain good amounts of zinc, but the
absorption bioavailability will be lower compared to animal-­source
foods.

Potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) are the main intracellular and extracellular cations, respectively, and are involved in transport of fluids and
nutrients across the cellular membrane. The AI for potassium is related
to its effects in maintaining a healthy blood pressure, reducing risk for
nephrolithiasis, and supporting bone health. Moderate potassium deficiency occurs even in the absence of hypokalemia and can result in
increased blood pressure, stroke, and other CV disease.
For people at increased risk of hypertension and who are salt sensitive, reducing sodium intake and increasing potassium intake is
advised. Leafy green vegetables, vine fruits (e.g., tomatoes, eggplant,
zucchini, pumpkin), and root vegetables (e.g., yams, beets) are good
sources of potassium (see Table 60.6). People with impaired renal function may need to reduce potassium intake, because hyperkalemia can
increase the risk for fatal cardiac arrhythmias among these patients.
Most dietary sodium (i.e., sodium chloride, or table salt) in the
United States is found in processed foods, breads, and condiments (Fig.
60.5). Sodium salt (NaCl) is added to foods to serve as a preservative
and enhance palatability. Sodium has an AI, but given the risk of table
salt–related hypertension, an UL has also been set. The UL threshold
may be even lower in certain populations, who on average may be more
sodium salt sensitive, and for those with hypertension or preexisting
renal disease. Dietary sodium intake also displaces potassium intake.
Elevated sodium:potassium ratios can increase the risk for nephrolithiasis. Intakes of <2,300 mg sodium (approximately 1 tsp of table salt) per
day are recommended. The average daily salt intake for most people in
the United States and Canada exceeds both the AI and UL. For populations with or at risk of hypertension and renal disease, sodium intake
should be decreased to <1,500 mg/day and potassium intake increased
to >4,700 mg/day. For persons with hypertension, additional dietary
guidelines are available from the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan.

Vitamin D

WATER

Iron

Iron requirements are relatively higher during infancy and early childhood than later in life and are higher for menstruating females than for
males of similar age-­groups (see Chapter 72). Iron from animal protein
is more bioavailable than that found in animal-­source foods such as
milk or plant sources because it is already incorporated into heme moieties in blood and muscle. Iron deficiency is the most common micronutrient deficiency in the world and is associated with iron-­deficiency
anemia and neurocognitive deficits in some children.

Zinc

Vitamin D insufficiency is more common than previously thought
in infants and children. Vitamin D is central to calcium and bone
metabolism but is also an important determinant of various nonosseous health outcomes (see Chapter 69). Children of all ages with
darker skin and those who do not consume fortified dairy products
should be considered for screening for vitamin D deficiency. The
DRI for vitamin D is based on its effects on calcium status and bone
health. The goal is to achieve serum 25-­hydroxyvitamin D levels >50
nmol/L (30 ng/dL). Breast milk is a poor source of vitamin D. The
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends total vitamin D
intake of 400 IU/day for infants (0 to <12 months). A supplement is
recommended for all breastfed infants to ensure sufficient intake. The
RDA of vitamin D is currently 600 units daily for healthy children
1-­18 years of age.

The daily water requirement and water content as a proportion of body
weight are highest in infants and decrease with age. Water intake is
achieved with liquid and food intake, and losses include excretion in
the urine and stool, as well as insensible and evaporative losses through
the skin and respiratory tract. An AI has been established for water
(see Table 60.6). Special considerations are required by life stages and
by BMR, physical activity, body proportions (surface area to volume),
environment, and underlying medical conditions. Breast milk and
infant formula provide adequate water, and additional water or other
fluid intake is not required until complementary foods are introduced.
Water contains no calories, but the concern is that additional water
intake in young infants will decrease breast milk intake and displace
the intake of essential nutrients during this phase of rapid rate of
growth and high metabolic activity. The relatively higher fluid needs of

No adverse effects associated
with vitamin K consumption from
food or supplements have been
reported in humans or animals;
however, high intakes still should
be taken with precaution.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Patients receiving anticoagulant therapy or
taking long-­term antibiotics should monitor
vitamin K intake.

Note: Starred (*) numbers are adequate intake (AI) and bold numbers are RDA. RDAs and AIs may both be used as goals for individual intake. RDAs are set to meet the needs of 97–98% of members in a group. For healthy breastfed infants,
the AI is the mean intake. The AI for other life stage and gender groups is believed to cover the needs of all members of the group, but lack of data prevents specifying with confidence the percentage covered by this intake.
UL is the maximum level of daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse effects. Unless otherwise specified, the UL represents total intake from food, water, and supplements. Because of a lack of suitable data, ULs could not
be established for potassium, water, or inorganic sulfate. In the absence of ULs, extra caution may be warranted in consuming levels above recommended intakes.
ND amounts are not determinable because of a lack of data on adverse effects in this age-­group and concern with regard to lack of ability to handle excess amounts. Source of intake should be from food only to prevent high levels of
intake.
*RDA for vitamin D in IU/day: 400 if <1 yr age, 600 if >1 yr, lactating, or pregnant.

Hypertension, increased risk of
cardiovascular disease and

AI is set based on ability to obtain a
nutritionally adequate diet for other
nutrients and to meet the needs for
sweat losses for persons engaged
in recommended levels of physical
activity.
Persons engaged in activity at higher
levels or in humid climates resulting in
excessive sweating might need more
than the AI.
UL applies to apparently healthy
persons without hypertension; it thus
may be too high for persons who
already have hypertension.

Processed foods with
added table salt,
benzoate, phosphate;
salted meats, nuts, cold
cuts; margarine; butter;
salt added to foods in
cooking or at the table.
Salt is about 60% chloride
by weight.

In concert with sodium, results
in hypertension

Chloride is lost, usually with sodium, in
sweat and in vomiting and diarrhea.
AI and UL are equimolar in amount to
sodium because most of sodium in
diet comes as table salt.

Fruits and vegetables,
dried peas, dairy
products, meats, nuts

None documented from food
alone, but potassium from
supplements or salt
substitutes can result in
hyperkalemia and possibly
sudden death if excess is
consumed by persons with
chronic renal insufficiency
(kidney disease) or diabetes

Persons taking drugs for cardiovascular
disease such as ACE inhibitors,
ARBs, or potassium-­sparing diuretics
should be careful not to consume
supplements containing potassium
and might need to consume less than
the AI.

ADVERSE EFFECTS OF
EXCESSIVE CONSUMPTION

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Fish liver oils, flesh of fatty
fish, liver, eggs from
hens that have been
fed vitamin D, fortified
milk products, fortified
cereals

Elevated plasma 25(OH)D
concentration causing
hypercalcemia

Patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy
might require additional vitamin D.

Milk, cheese, yogurt, corn
tortillas, calcium-­set
tofu, Chinese cabbage,
kale, broccoli

Kidney stones, hypercalcemia,
milk alkali syndrome, renal
insufficiency

Amenorrheic women (exercise or
anorexia nervosa induced) have
reduced net calcium absorption.

SELECTED FOOD
SOURCES

ADVERSE EFFECTS OF
EXCESSIVE CONSUMPTION

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Heme sources: meat,
poultry, fish
Nonheme sources: dairy,
eggs, plant-­based foods
like whole grains, nuts,
seeds, legumes, and
leafy greens, breads,
cereals, breakfast foods

GI distress

Persons with decreased gastric acidity
may be at increased risk for deficiency.
Cow’s milk is a poor source of
bioavailable iron and is not
recommended for children
<1 yr old.
Neurocognitive deficits have been
reported in infants with iron deficiency.
RDA for females increases with
menarche related to increased
losses during menstruation.
Vegans and vegetarians might require
iron supplementation or intake of
iron-­fortified foods.
GI parasites can increase iron losses via
GI bleeds.
Iron supplements can interfere with
zinc absorption, and vice versa; if
supplements are being used, the
doses should be staggered.

Meats, shellfish, legumes,
fortified cereals, whole
grains

Acutely, zinc supplements
cause GI irritation and
headache; chronic effects of
zinc supplementation include
impaired immune function,
changes in lipoprotein
and cholesterol levels, and
reduced copper status.

Zinc supplements interfere with iron
absorption, and vice versa; therefore
if supplements are being used, the
doses should be staggered.
Zinc deficiency can be associated with
stunting or impaired linear growth.
