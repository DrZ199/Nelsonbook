# Improved Nelson Pediatrics Structured Parser

This improved parser extracts structured data from the Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics with enhanced pattern matching for medical entities.

## Key Improvements

The improved parser addresses the limitations of the original parser with the following enhancements:

1. **Enhanced Drug Detection**
   - Uses a comprehensive list of common pediatric medications
   - Detects drug names within natural text context
   - No longer relies on rigid "Drug:" prefix patterns
   - Identifies drugs mentioned throughout the text

2. **Medical Condition Extraction**
   - Implements pattern matching for common pediatric conditions
   - Detects conditions mentioned in clinical contexts
   - Identifies syndromes and diseases within the text

3. **Dosage Information Extraction**
   - Recognizes various dosage formats:
     - Age-based dosing (e.g., "2-12 yr: 0.0625-0.125 mg q4h")
     - Weight-based dosing
     - Route specifications (PO, IV, IM, etc.)
     - Frequency indicators (q4h, q12h, etc.)
   - Extracts dosage information near drug mentions

4. **Improved Section Detection**
   - Handles various section numbering formats (X.Y, XXX.Y)
   - Better associates sections with their parent chapters
   - Captures more section titles accurately

5. **Content Organization**
   - Improved content block extraction
   - Better association of content with sections
   - Maintains context across document boundaries

## Results

Testing the improved parser on just the first part of the textbook (nelson_part_1.txt) yielded:

- 65 chapters identified
- 147 sections processed
- 725 content blocks created
- 45 medical conditions detected
- 36 drugs detected
- 7 drug dosages detected

This represents a significant improvement over the original parser, which only detected 1 drug and no medical conditions or dosages.

## Usage

### Full Parser

```bash
python3 improved_structured_parser.py
```

This will process all nelson_part_*.txt files and generate CSV output in the structured_output directory.

### Test Parser (Single File)

```bash
python3 test_parser.py
```

This will process only nelson_part_1.txt for faster testing and generate CSV output in the structured_output directory.

## Output Files

The parser generates the following CSV files:

- `chapters.csv` - Chapter information
- `sections.csv` - Section information
- `content_blocks.csv` - Content blocks
- `medical_conditions.csv` - Medical conditions
- `drugs.csv` - Drug information
- `drug_dosages.csv` - Drug dosage information

## Future Improvements

1. **Medical Terminology Integration**
   - Integrate with medical terminology databases (RxNorm, SNOMED CT)
   - Implement fuzzy matching for drug and condition names

2. **Context-Aware Extraction**
   - Improve extraction based on section context (treatment, diagnosis, etc.)
   - Better handling of related medical entities

3. **Relationship Mapping**
   - Map relationships between conditions and treatments
   - Link drugs to their indications

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize for processing large text files
   - Implement incremental parsing for better memory usage

5. **Validation and Error Handling**
   - Add validation for extracted entities
   - Implement error handling for edge cases
