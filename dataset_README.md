# Nelson Pediatrics Comprehensive Dataset

This dataset combines information extracted from the Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics 22nd Edition into a structured format for easy access and analysis.

## Dataset Files

1. **dataset.csv** - Combined dataset with both medical conditions and drugs
2. **condition_dataset.csv** - Detailed dataset focused on medical conditions
3. **drug_dataset.csv** - Detailed dataset focused on drugs and dosages

## Dataset Structure

### dataset.csv

This file combines the most important information about medical conditions and drugs into a single dataset:

- **entity_id**: Unique identifier for the entity
- **entity_type**: Type of entity ('condition' or 'drug')
- **entity_name**: Name of the condition or drug
- **section_title**: Title of the section where the condition is described (for conditions)
- **chapter_title**: Title of the chapter where the condition is described (for conditions)
- **part_title**: Title of the part where the condition is described (for conditions)
- **volume_title**: Title of the volume where the condition is described (for conditions)
- **dosage**: Dosage information (for drugs)
- **route**: Administration route (for drugs)
- **age_group**: Age group for the dosage (for drugs)

### condition_dataset.csv

This file contains detailed information about medical conditions:

- **condition_id**: Unique identifier for the condition
- **condition_name**: Name of the condition
- **clinical_manifestations**: Clinical manifestations of the condition (if available)
- **epidemiology**: Epidemiological information about the condition (if available)
- **section_id**: ID of the section where the condition is described
- **section_number**: Number of the section
- **section_title**: Title of the section
- **chapter_id**: ID of the chapter containing the section
- **chapter_title**: Title of the chapter
- **chapter_number**: Number of the chapter
- **part_id**: ID of the part containing the chapter
- **part_number**: Number of the part (e.g., "I", "V")
- **part_title**: Title of the part
- **volume_id**: ID of the volume containing the part
- **volume_title**: Title of the volume

### drug_dataset.csv

This file contains detailed information about drugs and dosages:

- **drug_id**: Unique identifier for the drug
- **drug_name**: Name of the drug
- **brand_names**: Brand names for the drug (if available)
- **indications**: Indications for the drug (if available)
- **dosage_id**: Unique identifier for the dosage
- **dosage**: Dosage information
- **route**: Administration route
- **age_group**: Age group for the dosage

## Usage

This dataset can be used for:

1. **Medical Education**: Quick reference for pediatric conditions and drugs
2. **Clinical Decision Support**: Structured data for integration into clinical systems
3. **Research**: Analysis of pediatric conditions and treatments
4. **Application Development**: Building medical reference applications

## Example Queries

### Find all drugs with dosages for a specific age group:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')

# Filter for drugs for children 6-12 years
drugs_6_12 = df[(df['entity_type'] == 'drug') & (df['age_group'].str.contains('6-12', na=False))]
print(drugs_6_12[['entity_name', 'dosage', 'route']])
```

### Find all conditions in a specific part of the textbook:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')

# Filter for conditions in the Respiratory Disease part
respiratory_conditions = df[(df['entity_type'] == 'condition') & 
                           (df['part_title'] == 'Respiratory Disease')]
print(respiratory_conditions[['entity_name', 'chapter_title']])
```

## Data Generation

This dataset was created using the `create_dataset.py` script, which:

1. Loads the CSV files generated by the enhanced structured parser
2. Merges the data to create relationships between entities
3. Creates specialized datasets for conditions and drugs
4. Combines the most important information into a single dataset

To regenerate the dataset:

```bash
python3 create_dataset.py
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Relationships**: Add direct relationships between conditions and their treatments
2. **Medical Coding**: Add standardized medical codes (ICD-10, SNOMED CT, RxNorm)
3. **Full Text Integration**: Link to relevant text passages from the textbook
4. **Expanded Attributes**: Add more attributes for conditions and drugs
5. **Semantic Search**: Add embeddings for semantic search capabilities
